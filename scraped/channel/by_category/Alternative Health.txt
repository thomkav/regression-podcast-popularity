While true hypothyroidism does exist, it’s a diagnosis that clinicians need to take a closer look at. Many clinicians are prescribing thyroid hormone when it’s not necessary, or when a patient’s symptoms could be resolved by healing the gut. The effects can be harmful, both to patient health and to their wallets. Patients themselves may exacerbate the problem by requesting it based on something they’ve read. Hear case studies from two functional medicine doctors who are modeling an evidence-based, cost-effective approach to curb some of these issues commonly seen in treating the thyroid. https://drruscio.com/?p=34033 The Future of Functional Medicine Review, Clinical Newsletter is available at drruscio.com/review Looking for more?

The conversation starts off with a bit of a meditation on the idea of intentionality and how concentration in one area can bleed over into all activities. | On today’s episode, we are joined by Jim Girard and Jim Law, creator, and CEO of BioCharger respectively. It has become our new, favorite biohacking modality since having it at the gym for over three months. There has been an outpouring of compliments for the BioCharger, both from clients and trainers at the gym, so Ben wanted to find out more about how what is causing all these reported benefits. | We’ve got another Q&A episode with Ashleigh VanHouten and we kick off the conversation with gratitude, sharing about our tendency to become entitled when we have immediate access to everything all the time and how we need to generate a daily attitude of thankfulness. Self-acceptance also plays a big role because your ability to love yourself will inevitably trickle down to how you treat the people around you and how you influence your environment with positive or negative energy. | On the podcast today we are very lucky to have James FitzGerald! James is the founder of OPEX Fitness, an amazing coaching platform and James' progressive and steadfast approach to health, strength, and wellness is truly an inspiration. A major tenet of OPEX and James' vision is longevity and they put a lot of focus on fitness in the long run rather than short term goals. | Today Ashleigh VanHouten is hosting another Q&A session during which she asks Ben all the questions listeners have been sending their way. Ben starts by giving us an overview of his next few weeks of traveling, hosting muscle camps and attending the Health Optimisation Summit, and they get into the need for mentorship – physical, psychological, spiritual – and the many different people who have inspired and motivated him on his bodybuilding and health and fitness journey. | On today’s episode, we sit down with Dr. Albert Villoldo to discuss the integration of our spiritual reality with our tangible reality. Dr. Villoldo is a trained scientist and anthropologist who traded his laboratory for a pair of hiking boots and a ticket to the Amazon to set out on a journey into spiritual enlightenment. Inside this episode, Dr. Villoldo shares with us his journey towards spirituality, some of the misconceptions around plant medicines, and how to stay grounded in this spiritual journey that we’re ultimately living. | In this episode, Ashleigh is back to ask Ben another round of questions and discuss all things health, fitness and getting your mind right. Today's questions cover bulking, calorie intake, nutrient timing, a variation of workouts, the benefits of posing, injury recovery and more. As usual, Ben makes an argument for eating the least amount necessary for growth and gives some great advice on when to fuel and refuel in relation to your times of exertion. | Today’s guest is a functional medicine practitioner with an extensive background in getting results with people with autoimmunity and health optimization. Dr. Will Cole joins me for this episode to talk about strategies behind optimizing your diet and your lifestyle, sharing how he went from a traditional vegan diet to one that includes a small amount of meat and why he felt that making this change was necessary. | Welcome back to the show everyone! Today we are doing our usual Q&A session with Ashleigh in the driving seat again. The episode starts off with some serious thoughts from Ben on the subjects of slumps and how our focus and conscious thought really define so much of our lives. A lot of the time we are shaped and directed by forces outside of ourselves and what makes it crazy is we do not even know this. | Today on the Muscle Intelligence Podcast we are very happy to welcome Dr. Tim Royer to talk to us about the mind and the nervous system! Dr. Royer works with all types of patients, from young children to high performing sports champions and has developed a method, using feedback loops and conscious effort to train the mind to navigate its own sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.

In case you missed it, seed cycling is a protocol where you consume specific seed combinations during distinct phases of the menstrual cycle in order to balance female hormones. The excitement is understandable. The promise of a simple, food-based solution to heal your hormonal woes is certainly compelling. However, overall, the science on seeds does not support the claims that are being made - eating this or that seed at a certain time in your cycle doesn’t regulate your hormones.

None of these are experiences we want to have. Yet few humans get through life without being touched by one or another, in some way. This is particularly so for women.

In this episode\xa0my friend Dr. James Gordon, a Harvard-trained psychiatrist and a world-renowned expert in using mind body medicine to heal depression, anxiety, and psychological trauma, shares his views on the trauma faced by women in the US, including the impact of sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and microaggressions against women, on physical pain, weight, mood, and self-sabotaging habits, and his wisdom and experience on how to reframe trauma into growth.

In my practice as a medical doctor and herbalist, I see the gut as the epicenter of health. It\'s often one of the first areas of the body that I work on for helping my patients with many, many different types of conditions. What we know about the health of the newborn and the newborn\'s microbiome for example, how childhood and lifelong health can be altered by cesarean section or introduction of antibiotics to the mom in labor or at the time of the c-section, is eye-opening and just a tip of the iceberg on why the microbiome is something we should all know how to support and protect. Today I want to introduce you to one of the world\'s leading microbiome experts, Dr. Joseph Petrosino.

It’s a scary thing to hear, and often, the information isn’t delivered with the whole picture: namely that most HPV infections clear up on their own and most pre-cancerous lesions resolve spontaneously, with very little risk that they will progress to cancer. While appropriate conventional follow-up testing and treatment are absolutely essential with HPV and all cervical changes, and are part of a safe, healthy integrative approach, I\'d like to share what\'s known about the natural approaches that have been researched with some promising results that women might want to use, not as a substitute, but while waiting to do follow-up testing for mild to moderate cervical changes.\xa0 To read a companion article to this episode, go to avivaromm.com/104. | Most women don\'t think about their cervix until they have to get a Pap smear.

What did these indigenous people eat to survive over 60,000 years in the harsh climate of Australia? Australian author John Newton explores this subject in his book "The Oldest Foods on Earth."

And she guides us all on how to incorporate this approach into our day-to-day lives. For more on Rainforest Bounty, visit their website here.\xa0 Check out our sponsor: Ancestral Supplements.

And what about honey? Why is it so hard to find the real deal? And are we consuming more than we should? Beekeeper and teacher Leo Sharashkin answers these questions and more. Leo learned beekeeping from his uncle in his native Russia. Today, among other things, Leo offers his theory on why we have a dying bee population. He describes what wild beekeeping looks like. And he addresses the question of honey adulteration (why not all honey on the shelves is true honey).\xa0 By the end of the conversation you\'ll gain insights on bees, honey, and how Leo lives out the theme of the book he edited "Keeping Bees with a Smile."\xa0 For more from Leo, visit his website: horizontalhive.com.

In our pockets we have tiny technological miracles through which we can communicate, instantly, with anyone on the planet. We are constantly bombarded with endless information. But what impact is all this having on our brain? Why is it important to allow our brains to drift into random thoughts and be creative? I discuss all this with neuroscientist and brain surgeon, Dr Rahul Jandial, who loves technology but believes that we need to structure some boundaries around its use – especially for children. We talk about the impact of music on the brain and what it means to be in flow state. Dr Jandial explains what happens in the brain when we engage in what he calls “meditative breathing” and why he is such a huge proponent of it. He explains how his\xa0knowledge of brain health has shaped the way he parents– from encouraging navigational skills in his children to exposing them to a diverse range of experiences. It seems where the brain is concerned – if you don’t use it, you lose it! Finally, he draws on his years of experience as a brain surgeon to share some practical tips that can help us all get the best out of our minds.\xa0Show notes available at\xa0https://drchatterjee.com/brainsurgeonFollow me on\xa0instagram.com/drchatterjee/Follow me on\xa0facebook.com/DrChatterjee/Follow me on\xa0twitter.com/drchatterjeeukDISCLAIMER: The content in the podcast and on this webpage is not intended to constitute or be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

This week, I am joined by world leading expert in the field of nutritional psychiatry, Professor Felice Jacka, to discuss her ground-breaking research into the link between food and our mental health. We discuss why lifestyle medicine should be the starting point for many mental health conditions and why there is an urgent need to train medical practitioners to give such lifestyle advice. We delve into the important role the gut microbiome plays in this area and how a diet rich in diversity is key. We also talk about the link between a mother’s diet in pregnancy and their child’s emotional health.

He believes that the next frontier of human performance is the mind and his superhuman feats are testament to that fact. He is the first ever swimmer to circumnavigate the whole of Great Britain without ever setting foot on land. And this is just one in a long list of mind-blowing accomplishments for Ross.But how is all that relevant to the rest of us? As well as talking about how he got through his epic journey, Ross explains the science behind why our minds limit us. He explains how we can all push ourselves beyond our comfort zones and reap the amazing knock-on benefits that come from doing that. We delve into the importance of intrinsic motivation and self-discovery through self-discipline. Ross speaks with wisdom and humility and is truly inspirational – he challenges you to go on your own journey of self-discovery.

He also plans to raise awareness of sustainability along the way. Tony believes that we are a species that is destined to be innately empowered, wild and connected yet our modern lives are removing us from this natural state. For the last 18 years, Tony’s whole raison d’etre has been to find ways of living that are more in sync with our human biology in order to allow himself, his family and his clients to thrive in this modern world and in this episode, we discuss what he has learnt. Tony believes that the closer you take people to nature, the better able they are to heal. Many would consider Tony’s lifestyle extreme – he has no chairs in his house and is mostly barefoot. Tony explains why he has made the decision to get rid of all the chairs in his home, why the squat is so important and why having functioning feet is critical for our overall health. Tony also shares some simple ways that office workers and night shift workers can improve their health whilst at work.

In this episode, I talk to world-leading sleep researcher, author of the international best-selling book ‘Why We Sleep’ and Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology, Matthew Walker. We discuss everything you ever needed to know about sleep. Matthew shares some brilliant tips to combat jet lag, explains how sleep can enhance athletic performance and decrease risk of injury and reveals just how much caffeine consumption can impact sleep. We explore the reasons behind the current global sleep-loss epidemic and how sleep deprivation can affect every aspect of our health – from our blood sugar levels and our risk of heart attack to our mental health. Finally, we discuss alcohol’s impact on sleep and the staggering financial costs associated with lost sleep. Matthew also shares what he has changed in his own life since starting his research. This is an invaluable conversation – I hope you enjoy it!Please note: Matthew has agreed to do a follow-up podcast to answer any questions you may still have about sleep.

But why? Long before they gained a bad reputation, it seemed to researchers, scientists and doctors as though psychedelics were going to be the new wonder drugs for mental illnesses. They promised to treat conditions like alcoholism, depression and anxiety without the side effects associated with conventional drugs. But unfortunately, in the 1960’s, there was a backlash against the counter-culture who had embraced psychedelics and all further research was banned. Now, decades later, the world is in the grip of a mental health crisis. But thankfully, there is a glimmer of hope – research has recently begun again on the amazing potential of LSD, DMT and psilocybin. This week, I sit down with Michael Pollan to take a deep dive into this extraordinary world. We explore the remarkable history of psychedelics, the findings of the current research in this area and Michael shares his own personal experiences with psychedelics under the guidance of therapists. Whilst larger scale studies are still needed, we talk about how therapist-guided psychedelic drug therapy could potentially change the way healthcare is delivered for mental illnesses – perhaps meaning a resolution of not only symptoms for patients, but also in many cases, the fundamental root causes. Finally, we discuss the potential wider use of psychedelics as a tool for social change.

We talk about his childhood, how much tennis he and his brother (Andy Murray) played as children and whether just focusing on one sport is beneficial for children. We also discuss the benefits of playing doubles and Jamie talks about his youtube channel in which he has created instructional videos to help people improve their doubles game.

It begins with good genes, but it also depends on good habits. If you adopt the right lifestyle, experts say, chances are you may live up to a decade longer. So, what’s the formula for success? National Geographic Explorer and author Dan Buettner has lead teams of researchers across the globe to uncover the secrets of Blue Zones—geographic regions where high percentages of centenarians are enjoying remarkably long, full and happy lives. In this week’s episode, I talk with Dan about his adventures in the Blue Zones and discuss what we can all learn from his findings.Dan found commonalities amongst each of these Blue Zones which led to a formula for success that includes lifestyle, community and purpose. We delve into all these areas and discuss how achieving a long, healthy and happy life is something that goes far beyond personal responsibility. People in these longevity hot spots do not pursue health and happiness. Health and happiness ensues from the environment which they are in. Dan explains what you can do to design your surroundings to stack the deck in favour of health, longevity and happiness. We also discuss Dan’s Blue Zones Project - a health and longevity initiative that models the principles of communities around the world that have the longest living people and applies those principles to other cities and communities. The results have been staggering.Finally, Dan explains how he has changed his own lifestyle following his research and he shares his top tips for living a longer and more fulfilling life.

Instead of viewing exercise as something that is embedded into your self worth or fear of getting bigger, I invite you to examine how this mentality has become engrained into your mindset. Shift Your Mindset Around Movement You don't have to exercise excessively in order to have good health and an improved mental state. If you want to come to a place where you feel better about your body, I invite you to try shifting your mindset around movement to find joy and the excitement in play instead of counting calories and viewing exercise as a transactional relationship.\xa0 Instead of being scared of what will happen if you do not go intense, be willing to stop and take where you are in your life and your health journey into consideration. If you can broaden your view from exercise to movement, bring in the nourishing aspect of life and take into account the entirety of your wellbeing, you can let your innate knowledge be the guide to helping you enjoy movement and all of its benefits.\xa0 Do you use intuition to guide your movement practice? Let me know in the comments on the episode page. \xa0 On Today's Episode  Tips for those who can't handle a lack of structure when it comes to fitness (11:16) Understanding how our feelings drive our behaviors and how to change that (16:10) Why you should adopt a new vocabulary of movement without the baggage (17:35) Viewing food and movement as joy and play instead of calories or fuel (19:12) How to broaden and expand your view of movement to find true wellbeing (25:40)  \xa0 Quotes “I was afraid to stop doing any type of intense exercise because my fear was always getting bigger. And that fear of getting bigger, or not getting smaller, which is the flip side to that coin, really drove a lot of my behaviors.” (8:36) “If you are the kind of person who has a trip planned and you are already freaking out about ‘where are you going to go, is it going to be open, what is the schedule going to be like, can you stick to your normal routines, what's going to happen if you can't do your usual workout, are you going to gain weight’, I think this is a chance for you to look at that.” (10:38) “My role here with this podcast is to point out some of the obvious truths that maybe aren't so obvious to you because you haven't looked in it in that way.” (16:58) “Movement doesn't always have to be structured and for time and pushing yourself to the max. So see if you can broaden this as a mindset of caring for your body and your mind instead of micromanaging what you see on the scale or punishing yourself for what you ate. Look at it as an opportunity to nourish yourself.” (26:51) \xa0 Resources Mentioned In This Show HTK 242: Limiting Beliefs w/ Allegra Stein HTK 214: 6 Reasons Why BMI Is Bullshit Nutritional Therapy 101 Free 7 Day Course Order Core 4 The Book Here Nutritional Therapy Association Website Harder to Kill Radio is sponsored by the Nutritional Therapy Association.

What people truly care about is how you made them feel and what actions you took to inspire others. This is the moving force behind Jake Thompson, a long-time friend, motivational speaker, and genuine person who is dedicated to sharing his philosophy for living a life full of more joy and empowerment. Happiness Is Worth Fighting For Instead of focusing on other people's successes, Jake urges you to stay in your own lane and focus on your own personal growth. So many of us settle for what we think we are capable of, and Jake is inspiring people to do more than they think they can. By working through the failures in life as part of the process and focusing on the present version of yourself you can reach your top true speed in life. Every time you fail you are one step closer to figuring out what is right for your life. By flipping your perspective, showing up consistently every day and not letting outside noise complicate your process you can reach your full potential just by competing with yourself. Jake urges you to start being in competition with yourself, because your own happiness is worth fighting for, and what matters most is what you chose to build around you. Are you ready to run your own race and give everything to the pursuit of everything you could be?

How can we teach them to have the mindset every day to just wake up and attack the day.” (9:18) “The things that make you successful in sports and weight lifting are the things that make you successful in life. And I don't know why it took me so long to connect the dots.” (20:22) “There is always going to be someone ahead of us, there's always going to be someone behind us. But none of that actually matters because us looking at that, paying attention to that, is only slowing us down from doing our best.” (27:27) “You have to be selfish to a degree so that you can take care of yourself and show up for others. Because if you arent taking care of yourself eventually you are going to break down and you won't be able to show up for others.” (37:01) “We all have some degree of talent and skills, what matters more than talent is your effort, and it is twice as important.” (42:36) \xa0 Resources Mentioned In This Show Compete Every Day Website Follow Jake on Instagram Jake Thompson Website Cultivate a Winning Mindset Podcast Order The Core Four Here Nutritional Therapy Association Website Harder to Kill Radio is sponsored by the Nutritional Therapy Association.

Fear Around Food Disordered relationships with food are an increasingly common problem and something that many people including yours truly have struggled with on a serious level. Negative body image, poor body confidence, dysmorphic thoughts, and stress and anxiety can all be related to our relationship with food and this episode is all about exploring the spectrum of disordered eating.\xa0 Learn why I have no tolerance for those who dismiss fear around food, how Paleo helped me feel more comfortable in my body, why I am passionate about bridging the gap between intuitive eating and nutritional therapy, plus much more. If you feel like the rules and constructs you have around food is causing you stress, anxiety or social isolation, and want to stop the on again off again dieting, it is important to keep having these conversations. And if you are serious about helping people change the way they think about food you need to be open to having your mind changed as well.\xa0 What about this episode made you feel called to make a change and shift into a new direction when thinking about our unique relationships with food? Share with me in the comments on the episode page. \xa0 On Today's Episode  Exploring the role intention, impact and Paleo had on my nutrition journey (10:50) Getting away from diet culture in the traditional sense to find food harmony (12:10) Why continuing to just talk about the ‘what’ of nutrition is not enough (21:00) Dismissing nutrition and intuitive eating myths and setting the record straight (23:25) What to do if you need help with disordered eating right now (28:10)  \xa0 Quotes “It's beyond debilitating and fucks with your head when you really do judge your own self-worth and value from what the scale says.” (9:13) “For me personally, Paleo was a great stepping stone, I really started learning about how to eat more nourishing foods and what that looked like and just get on this path to feeling better in my body.” (13:43) “If we are going to do healing protocols on folks who have problematic relationships with food, we have to address that relationship with food first.” (17:33) “Intuitive eating is not a diet, it's not going to be something you can just flip in and out of, or that’s got one specific set of rules. It's highly nuanced and its a process, it is a living, breathing thing.” (29:37) \xa0 Resources Mentioned In This Show HTK 238: Messy Thoughts On Food Part 1 HTK 143: Dr. Tee Williams HTK 150: Goodbye.

Well, it's time to cut that out because it isn't helping. “I used to be able to…” At one time in my life – about 6 years ago – I front squatted 240 pounds. Today, I front squatted 75 pounds. I’m not a bad person. I’m not “worse” now than I was back then. This is a different time in my life, and I have different priorities and interests. Back then I was training for olympic weightlifting. Now I do a mixture of different training: kettlebells, barbells, BJJ, corrective exercise. Be honest, how often do you start a sentence with “I used to be able to…” and go on to trash yourself for not being as XYZ as you used to be? Here’s the fierce love truth: You aren’t there anymore. You’re here, now. Maybe things have changed.Maybe you chose those things and you’re happy about it. Maybe you didn’t choose those things and it sucks. Either way, yes, feel your feelings. Reminisce, even. But at some point you have to process and keep moving. But let’s be clear: You weren’t a better person because you could squat more once upon a time. In today's episode, I'm serving up some real talk, support, and love so you can let go of living in the past and actually enjoy your present.

Today’s guest, Abby Corriveau, has been through a lot over the past couple of years. Her dedication to creating community, holding tight her values, and practicing gratitude has had a tremendous impact on her life. Community, Values & Gratitude Abby is a strength and sustainable movement coach who’s life was turned upside down when she found out her husband, also in the fitness industry, was cheating her. She felt she didn’t have anywhere to turn but ended up building her own community. Life changed again when she had to have intensive back surgery, causing her to reevaluate her approach to women’s fitness. When Abby felt like she’d lost everything, she realized she no longer had a fear of failure. In fact, she embraced chances like she never had before in order to create sustainable movement in her local community. By reflecting on her values, she knew that she had to build that community in order to stay true to herself. With her new community and support system, Abby has discovered the power of asking for help. Even as a solo entrepreneur, it’s okay to take a step back and let other people help you. And you never know what other people can teach you. As Abby healed through both her physical and emotional trauma, her view of the world and her career changed.

If they’re [your children] meant to be a scientist, they’re going to be a scientist. If they’re meant to be an artist, they’re going to be an artist. Don’t dictate their future.” (15:52)“Success has become the goal of childhood. Not play, not exploration, not nothingness, not boredom, not creativity, but success.” (19:58)“Our children are not here to live our lives. And they’re not here to fulfill our destinies.

You have to go inward in order to make this thing call parenting work.” (34:59)“Love is the most active thing you can feel. And it really involves no judgement, no approval, no conditions, no transactions. It’s really love for the other person’s essence no matter how they make you feel.” (37:06)“That’s the beautiful part of life. If life was all happy, there would be no nuance, there would be no adventure, there would be no complexity, and there would be no growth.” (43:27)“Meditation has been the single most profound tool in my life, so much so that I am more connected inward than outward.” (51:57)“We can’t be everything to all people and all things and all images of ourselves as women.” (54:44)“Mothering just takes the life out of us, doesn’t it?

Find out in today’s episode as Eric Thorton is back to teach us how to channel all the positive energies for self-betterment. \xa0 Ashley James:\xa0Hello, True Health seekers and welcome to another exciting episode of Learn True Health podcast. Today, we have Eric Thorton back on the show. He is a spiritual and energetic healer. What many of us refer to as a master. He was born with all of this gifts on and was able to commune with angels and guides since he was a child. You’ll definitely want to go back and listen to our first episode with him if you haven’t already because his life story is a trip. Let me tell you. I personally worked with him as has my husband and my friends and we’ve all had really great experiences. I wanted to make sure that he was the real deal and he is certainly is. You’re going to love today’s show. He teaches about more about energy medicine. Understanding our aura or energy field which is a part of our body that is scientifically proven. Illness can occur in the aura field and he teaches also how to clear your energy. Clear your aura field. We get into some really neat discussion. Some really neat ravitals that we go down today. I want to apologize for the slight audio issue that I have in this episode after I had set up our lapel mics. I was using a new system and it turns out that my lapel mic popped out. I didn’t realize it. My voice is actually picked up by his mic. So I did a lot of editing post-production to make it sounds as good as possible. It’s totally doable. You can definitely hear and understand us. I just sound like I’m farther away from the mic than he is and he sounds great since he does most of the talking. You’ll enjoy today’s show and you’ll forgive me for the light off on audio but all other episodes are sounding much better because we have figured out what the problem was and it won’t happen again. Fingers crossed, right? Knock on wood. I want to tell you that today’s episode if we had a sponsor, today’s episode would be brought to you by\xa0ENERGYbits. My son woke me up at four in the morning as toddlers will sometimes do. He was wide-awake and therefore I had to be wide-awake. Since my body would rather have slept for four more hours, I wouldn’t be here right now and be so perky if it wasn’t for\xa0ENERGYbits\xa0this morning. There’s no stimulants in them. There is no caffeine in them. It was just pure algae. It actually tastes really good to me. If you don’t like the flavor there’s easy ways to mask the flavor. Today I decided to take about a heaping tablespoon of the\xa0ENERGYbits\xa0and put them in the vitamix with one drop of peppermint essential oil and about 16oz of water. I blended it for about a minute until it had fully dissolved on high. Then I drink it. Within about 5 minutes, I felt it kick in and I was like, “Wow, this is better than coffee.” I don’t drink coffee anymore. I do occasionally have black or green tea but this was better than tea, better than coffee. I feel really good and it’s because it has so many nutrients bring oxygen to the cells. Perk our body up, support our adrenals, really readily available protein. I could go on and on about\xa0ENERGYbits. You can go to\xa0learntruehealth.com\xa0and search the term algae, chlorella or\xa0ENERGYbits. Listen to those episodes.

This is [0521-0525 Audio Gap] I’m so thrilled to be back here with you, Eric. We’re here with Eric Thorton in his wonderful healing studio in cottage like Washington. \xa0 [05:38] Eric Thorton:\xa0Thank you. \xa0 [05:39]\xa0Ashely James:\xa0 Yes. This is what? Our fifth interview together? \xa0 [05:42] Eric Thorton:\xa0 I think so. \xa0 [05:44] Ashely James:\xa0 It’s been wonderful having you on the show. I keep getting amazing feedback. People are saying that they love learning from you. \xa0 [05:52] Eric Thorton:\xa0 That’s terrific. \xa0 [05:53]\xa0Ashely James:\xa0 Yes. Today we’re going to dive into a topic that I think is very fascinating. People who haven’t explored this level of spirituality. They’re in for definitely a ride. I heard about the aura and their energy field and how we can clear our energy field. How that it has an impact on our physical, emotional and mental health. \xa0 [06:19] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Very much so. It’s pretty fascinating how it feels are.\xa0 It’s one of the most amazing things I get to watch. They’re absolutely phenomenal. How far out they reach. What they do. How they’re in a moment’s notice they change. \xa0 [06:36] Ashely James:\xa0 Now it’s like aura’s fields like static. \xa0 [06:39] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Static, yes. [06:41] Ashely James:\xa0 I’ve gone to psychic fairs or something that taking pictures of your aura field that’s like, “Oh, your aura fields’ blue.” That’s it. [Inaudible 06:50] \xa0 [06:51] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. If you go away from that picture from getting your picture taken and you go eat something. Come back, change your outfit so that they don’t know it’s you and take a picture again. It’s now different. \xa0 [07:05] Ashely James:\xa0 Because you – \xa0 [07:06] Eric Thorton:\xa0 You ate. \xa0 [07:08] Ashely James:\xa0 Because you ate? Food affects your aura? \xa0 [07:10] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Everything affects your aura. Your aura is a reflection of every cell’s energy and the soul’s energy. \xa0 [07:19] Ashely James:\xa0 Is that how some people can read an aura and then actually predict or tell someone what’s going on inside their body? \xa0 [07:27] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Exactly. Very much so. When I’m working on someone and I put my hand on their aura field, you can feel all sorts of hot, cold, disturbing, joyous, all five just by laying your hand down their energy field. I see in a million different feelings just by running your hand from head to toe about a foot above somebody. It can tell, it reflects predatory energy. It reflects non-predatory energies, it reflects joy. It reflects everything you can imagine is in the aura field. If you take a snapshot of the aura field so to speak like the krakian photography, I think that’s what they call it. It looks steady right at that moment because you have a steady picture but if they could film the aura field, that would be something interesting. At least a part of it, because it changes so dramatically. Your hormones can change 17th\xa0of a second, it changes the aura field from happy to angry. Tell the person, “You’ve had a lot of anger.” while a few minutes before, “Oh you have nothing but joy.” \xa0 [08:41]\xa0Ashely James:\xa0For those who don’t know, never heard of the aura field or know very little about it. Can you explain what it is? Why we have it? Does everything have an aura field? \xa0 [08:51] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Everything that is reproducing – Sorry, there’s two different types of aura fields. There’s an aura field that is where they’re in a physical body at some sort, trees, bacteria, mushrooms, humans etc. that’s reproducing cells has a different, has very dynamic aura field. A rock had cellular energy or crystal has cellular energy and is very static. I have to clarify that a little bit with crystals because crystals, anything that’s clear or semi-clear takes in energy from everything else. A crystal would take energy, sound or light or other and bend it and modify it. People who feel energy or see energy limited will feel crystals are alive because it’s swirling the energy just like a shakra. By bending the energy. It’s like doctor or scientist taking a mineral and making a medicine out of it. By bending or modifying the energy, you can heal or you can kill. What that same thing might damage or someone else’s aura field, it would help them. Crystals are very powerful tool but if they’re not working it’s because it’s not in sync with your aura field. If it is working then it’s sync and then it gets in there slightly takes your energy and modifies it and feeds it back to you like an immunization. Kind of like that. You’re giving your own immunization. It’s like giving your own energy but it’s inoculating you. Your own energy is inoculating you. Because it’s taking it, modify it, your brain goes, “Oh, I’ve got to do something about that.” But it’s your own energy but it’s slightly modified. The brain goes, your immune system will come up because of that there’s a slight modification but if you take crystals to modify the aura field, if you put two together, what are they doing to each other? How are they feeding the energy? How are they taking the energy that’s already modified slightly bring it to another crystal, modifying it again, shove it back to the other crystal and modify it again, shove it back to another crystal at the speed of light. So people can get very ill of that’s crystal aren’t tuned. That’s why we tune crystals even in the same room. \xa0 [11:35] Ashely James:\xa0I’ve had that experience actually. I’ve had a woman in the show I feel like sometime last year. Where she talked about using crystals in your environment to aid you on your health journey. When I was a teenager I was in Portoverdo walking around alone and I’ve been to Portoverdo a lot. I knew the streets. I was very familiar with the territory. I bought a crystal necklace. Quartz crystal necklace. Immediately put it on because at that time, I didn’t now about cleaning crystals or you know, doing them. I immediately become disoriented. Lost, I walked down the street I was acusted by a man, I was afraid for my life. \xa0 [12:20] Eric Thorton:\xa0 I’m so sorry. \xa0 [12:22] Ashely James:\xa0 It was a contrast. Everything was good. I put on the crystal, everything was chaotic and crazy. I took it off because I started to go something like I was feeling like something’s wrong in here and I took the necklace off and I immediately knew where I was and I was safe. I was like, “Okay, something’s off with this.” If I buy a crystal or receive one and it’s not tuned, that its very uncomfortable to be with it. \xa0 [12:50] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Most people who are sensitive to those frequencies. Some people are associated to those frequencies even though it’s helping them. Some people are consciously aware of those frequencies. I’m very aware of those frequencies. I walk into a gem store. It feels like my brain is twisting and going into a fish eye. Everything was like I’m looking into a fish eye lens. I start to get sick. It maxes out my inner ear because I got all these diverging crystals modifying the energy back and forth to each other and there’s thousands of them. I was kind of go “I’m leaving.” I just have to walk out. \xa0 [13:33] Ashley James:\xa0That’s funny because you see all those new age stores today. The herbs and the teas and the crystals. But real people who are sensitive who are sort of like their wheelhouse. They walk in and would feel uncomfortable if the crystals are not attuned to them. It’s affecting their aura in a distorted turbulent way. \xa0 [14:01] Eric Thorton:\xa0 it’s very medicinal. In energy medicine of all sorts, you’ve mentioned herbal medicine also homeopathic medicine. It’s all energy. So you put a crystal around them it can totally wipe those empty. It can put a vibration that just empties all your homeopath and empties the effectiveness of your herbs. Or you can take it and combine them and create something modified that can be really effective or can be very bad. Just in the same room. \xa0 [14:36] Ashley James:\xa0 Be very intentional when using crystals. \xa0 [14:41] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Very much so. \xa0 [14:43] Ashley James:\xa0 Getting back to understand the aura, to those who don’t know what an aura is. It’s an energy field around the body like you’ve said that animals and plants also have an aura and people can learn to see them. I’d love to talk a bit about that later. I was this once, I want to say it 15 years ago, I was with a friend in Toronto and we went into a workshop at the I guess Downtown Toronto’s having this big psychic fair. The day before it started, they had this workshop on auras. The man brought out these dowsing rods. Basically take two metal hangers and straighten them out and then bend them so you’re holding them at 90 degree angle and he had someone stand in the middle of the stage with their back to him and he walked towards the person and when he gone about four feet of the person, the dowsing rods moved together. He didn’t moved them. He was just holding them gently and they moved together. Then he said, “Okay, now I want you to expand your awareness out 20 feet. I just want you focus on expanding your awareness your whole energy field out 20 feet. He didn’t teach the person now he just said expand your awareness. Your attention goes your energy flows. Then he walked all the way back to the stage and proceed to slowly walk towards the person and sure enough about 20 feet, when he reached the 20-foot area, the dowsing rods just flipped forward. Flipped together and he explained that you could walk around your head with this rods. Am I saying it right? Dowsing rods?\xa0 \xa0 [16:31] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes. That’s correct. I have many different kinds. [Crosstalk] \xa0 [16:34] Ashley James:\xa0 Oh cool. I got super into it because it’s really exciting. You could walk around your house and anytime you walk if there’s a pipe of moving water below you so like in the floor below you – \xa0 [16:48] Eric Thorton:\xa0 or non-moving. \xa0 [16:50] Ashley James:\xa0 or non-moving? Okay. Or things like you’re going past an electrical wire that’s in the floor below you or above you, basically if you go past an energy field because water creates an energy field and electricity creates an energy field, magnetic field that’s the dowsing rods would move. \xa0 [17:13] Eric Thorton:\xa0\xa0Those are really strong because their movement. It’s more subtle when it’s not moving. You take the dowsing rods and you want to find a lost wedding ring in the car that’s in the dark, then it’ll point right at it. Then you get there with the dowsing rods and that would say how deep it is. You can do. Because everything this is variation of energy a dowsing rod can pick it up and that’s part of auras. \xa0 [17:41] Ashley James:\xa0 Our septic tank was broken. A guy came up to fix it and he didn’t know where the tank was because it was buried and it’s digged into it. He wiped out his dowsing rods and I’m thinking, “Wait a sec, I thought dowsing rods were just for hippies to like practice aura work? Then he’s like, “Are you kidding me? This is why they’re invented. They’re invented to find wells, to find springs to find underground water basically. People use them to find water.” \xa0 [18:08] Eric Thorton:\xa0 I found many wells for people. \xa0 [18:11] Ashley James:\xa0 But the fact that that’s energy and to have an aura. Great homework for listeners at home. Go make yourselves some dowsing rods. You could look them up online and practice with your family and you’ll be able to – they’ll move in your hand. They’ll move when you walk close to and enter one of your family member’s aura fields. This is showing you that we have this robust energy filed around us. It is as real as our physical body. \xa0 [18:42] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Interesting thing about aura fields. There’s different name for the different layers of the aura field. The one you’re talking about we dug up the word earlier. The guide’s call it a homeostasic level. That can reach out for miles and miles. It’s literally picking up on the subtle differences in everything around you. It is the first part of your immune system. People look at me when I say that like, “What?” They think about it. If you’re out there five miles and yes, we are all intermingling. It’s picking up on this person energy, this person’s energy. Let’s say this person has an contagious cancer. It’s picking up on that. Your defense system goes to work. It starts mounting the defense if you walk by that person, they’re breathing out, you’re breathing in at the same time. You’re breathing in some if their cells. It already has your immune system go on and making sure you don’t get that cancer. It’s phenomenal. The only time the homeostasic doesn’t work for that is if you’re holding like a shopping cart. It’s the dirtiest thing there is. It’s the shopping cart. It’s dirtier than the toilets. You touched the shopping cart and you merely touch your face, the homeostasic can’t mount that defense because you walk and grab the cart, its hasn’t had the time to mount the defense yet but if someone’s out there where you’ve got sometime for your immune system to work it’ll do it. It’s also picking up and notifying this part, the homeostatic notifies the digestive brain. The digestive brain is they’ve done huge stages in Europe with it. It shows brain materials from the tip of your tongue all the way out the back door. That brain does not have sight or sound. It only works with feeling. It is I don’t what’s the statistics are when they had fully started that but I’ve watched it and it’s 20 times faster than your brain stem. It tells the amygdala. The amygdala tells the brain stem fight or flight in 30 minutes to a second and that’s picking up through the digestive brain. It’s the one that can tell if you have bad intention or not. If someone or makes the hair on the back of your neck when you don’t even see anybody. This is what is reaching out in the aura field. The homeostasic level. It is what gives us the early warning on everything. \xa0 [21:23] Ashley James:\xa0 When we have a gut feeling about someone. \xa0 [21:27] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Pay attention, it’s the homeostasic. \xa0 [21:30] Ashley James:\xa0That is the part. The last layer of your aura field that reaches out it can reach out for miles, it is feeling the intentions of people. It’s feeling what’s going on with disease or illness in that environment. \xa0 [21:47] Eric Thorton:\xa0 everything. It’s feeling an earthquake before it happens. It’s bringing your intuition in every way. It tells the amygdala what to do. The amygdala work in 30 minutes to a second and it tells our brain stem what to do. Prior to that this is actually one of the features that a master uses within themselves. If you think, 30 minutes to a second, that frequency and you learn to use the aura field. You can go as fast as 200th of a second. What’s in the frequencies between 30 minutes on the average person and 200 minutes of a second. What’s in that? That’s the information that masters rate. That’s the information that guides pick up on and angels pick up on. That’s where they exist. Masters are so sensitive that they’ve learned to be in that space. Pick up on all of this. Now, like yourself. Everyone does this, you’re sensitive so you pick up on things that gives you an intuition and it’s correct. It’s going through the digestive brain. It’s coming in and it’s formulating for you. It’s formulating questions for you to ask your interviewees and the ones you’re interviewing. \xa0 [23:13] Ashley James:\xa0 interviewees, yes. \xa0 [23:15] Eric Thorton:\xa0 is it interviewees? yes. \xa0 [23:17] Ashley James:\xa0You are the interviewee. \xa0 [23:18] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Good. I’ve got that right. Just like to see it. Literally, that part of the brain is formulating the question from what is picking up from the aura field. From the homeostasic. It goes all the way up from miles and miles and you can project it out that like what you’re talking about the guy with the dowsing rod because most people walk around, close it really tight. When you get flow, it’s out where it needs to be. That’s how we manifest. That’s how we do all of these things with this information. It’s through that level of the homeostasic, which is so dynamic part of our aura field. It’s fascinating to watch when you’re out walking where the people are closed in like that person on the stage. Or whether they’re open and how far they are open. You can tell people that you like or you wouldn’t like just by homeostasic field. If you’re person who loves flow, you’re going to be around someone that their aura field holding tight the homeostasic level doesn’t have any flow. You’re not going to be attracted to them. Your pheromones aren’t going to say, “Hey, you need to talk to that person.” It’s not going to happen because you’re not in the same ball park so to speak or in the same frequency as you are. Also, it what makes people look at me with the strange look in their eye when they walk by. They feel something they’re not familiar with it. So they turn to look and they’re kind of like, “What’s that?” because it’s so different in their aura field because I have a lot of flow when I’m out there along ways, it’s so different it causes them fear. Change is fear. That’s so human. That’s what changes fear but causes fear. When you watch that, when you get the privilege of watching this dynamic colors and frequencies and shapes, and information that’s out. Just was beautiful to watch. I talked about this a little before in the previous interview when you go to a movie with me, it’s fun to watch, not kind of fun to listen to me if I talk about it because I see everything before it happens. It’s in the homeostatic. Everybody’s stuff is coming through that movie screen and the sound all of the aura fields and what’s coming up next. If there’s whatever is on the stage of being people are mad at each other when the movie’s being made that’s all there. If they’re happily getting along, if there all this different things dynamics come out of this out of the film. Including the sensations of who wrote the script. It’s fascinating to the aura field is not only does it protect us, but it also creates frequencies that defend us. \xa0 [26:28] Ashley James:\xa0 How so? How so does the frequency defend us? You said the immune system. You said, it picks up on, gives intensions. How else does it defend us? \xa0 [26:39] Eric Thorton:\xa0 We have to go back to that frequency notion that light energy comes together. Yin and Yang are the opposites of the same energy. So they do come together. It’s also if you’re like your energy field in your history. Your aura field will reflect your history. Let’s say you have really wonderful parents. While you’re around someone with really rotten patients and they haven’t done any work, they haven’t grown from it, your aura fields are opposites. They don’t come together. You’re less likely to take energy on from somebody who’s opposites versus someone you empathize with. If you empathize with, “Oh, yes. I’ve been there done that.” It was just to say like energy comes together. With it comes their version of that same energy that may have predetorian energy with it and it may have thought forms with it. All these things that trigger your because you may have wonderful parents and they didn’t but it starts triggering you. That means they have wonderful parents too but it starts triggering you. Their issues same you both and maybe wonderful parents but you have this set of issues and they have this stem of issues. Issue A versus issue C. Well, this comes together because you both have wonderful parents but then so you co-miserate so to speak, or co-enjoy. They might come up against differences. Then you might pick up their parents thought forms that were different from your parents thought forms. This can be beneficial because it can make you a better parent or it can be confusing. It’s like, “No, my parents did it this way. This is the way I thought should want to do it but i feel this opposite thing” and it can confuse. \xa0 [28:49] Ashley James:\xa0This is on the subconciuse level? \xa0 [28:50] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Totally. Subconscious. It has to do with triggers all your pheromones. It triggers all your hormones. It’s a constant adjustment. The aura field’s fascinating. Everything you do, affects the aura field. It’s a dynamic tool that the body and the soul each have part of. The body has the molecular aura field. It is an animal, it is a molecular cell-producing animal. Anything that’s reproducing cells has this dynamic aura field. Or anything that’s not reproducing cells has a stagnant aura field like a rock. Like the one we’ve mentioned earlier crystals, they absorb that’s why little side note, don’t ever recommend the pendulum that’s clear or if light can come through because it picks up and it bends out light and an influence is set. I always recommend a solid stone or a piece of metal for a pendulum or a dowsing rod. It needs to be solid so it doesn’t get affected by all this stuff. Anyway, you have these, where was I? I digressed. \xa0 [30:16] Ashley James:\xa0Humans have a molecular animal, two kinds of auras. molecular which reminds me of quantum physics. Particle can both be a wave and a particle. \xa0 [30:31] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes. When you take that notion and you put it to practical application, that rock because it’s stagnant aura field isn’t going to be affected by intention. The same intention that someone who has a dynamic. Being that has a dynamic aura field. The rocks going to sit there. You can wish it death and it just sits there. It’s absorbing it, but it’s like an Apple computer. The hard drive system will just take things in it just sits there as long as it’s not affected by the virus. The rock takes it in and just sits there. It’s not affected by it. Let me tell you demons hate being put into rocks. They really hate that. If they’re really stubborn works great. It’s like a dynamic aura field everything you do affects it because it’s giving you information for safety, for immune system, for social behaviors. It’s just everything. We have this the bodies part which is it’s not like a rock it is still dynamic but it is different than the soul’s part. The soul’s part reaches out in a very different for different information than the body’s part. The shakra is where the soul’s and the body’s auras come together. When they’re in sync you have a very strong shakra when they’re out of sync, the shakra gets weak. If it’s out of sync long enough you get illness in the organs that are affected by the shakra. It can be very subtle. In fact, those subtle ones are the ones that create the cancer and create the illness because there’s such a low frequency. Those subtle frequencies are very low. They can create environment where your body can’t use this anti-oxidants correct. Then you develop disease. In the electromagnetic field which is part of the aura field, in electromagnetic level of the aura field, it’s a level that looks like, the closest vision I can describe it, it looks like those wall light switches that light up. Rooms which when you turn on the lights and at night they glow. Each part of the electromagnetic aura field looks like one of those lights. Except there’s one every single atom in your body. It’s not just the cells for the atom. Each one has a light switch. When those light switches are all on if you’re looking at this like a topographical map. If all the light switches are on the person healthy, if some of them are off those areas are not healthy. They’re not absorbing and being part of the dynamic of health. That’s one of the ways you can tell illness as you look at the electromagnetic field and you look at where those lights switches are off at. They’ll be over the liver, they’ll be over the knee. They’ll be over somewhere in the middle. You maybe developing cancer from a cellphone in a pocket say. That’s not attached to anything specific except knitting away. If you could switch those back to on position which is the negative ion then the cancer will go away. The building of cancer will go away so you don’t develop the cancer. This is what we were talking earlier about electromagnetic fields. Well, it’s the same thing expect that’s generated by some power plant or is it generate by our brain. The body’s portion of it. If you have the positive ions or electromagnetic field, being bombarded at you at an endless rate, it’s going to switch those little light switches from the negative ion which is health to the positive ion which is not health. That’s one of the ways electromagnetic fields can totally bombard somebody and then like we talked about it earlier if a person has a possession. Possessions are positive ion, which is not health t the human body. That’s why when they come around us we felt repulsed and we don’t know why. It’s like a wall of ill health coming at you. Your [Inaudible 00:35:22] if it’s dramatic if it’s sudden. As it moves closer and closer more closer in there it affect the electromagnetic field more and more and more and more. That’s why I offer people an exercise in helping to clear that. Soon what you’re going to learn today so that if you do have a possession that walks in it doesn’t become yours. If it sits there for a long time, it’s going to affect your energy field enough that it could break it down and come it. Where you can move it in the beginning, it’s easy. Anybody can do it. Not your energy in the beginning you haven’t molded with it. We’ll teach people how to clear their energy field. It’s very simple. In fact it’s simple, it’s almost too simple. We’ll work with that a little later in the interview. Anyway, the aura field also the physical aura field reflects every single cell of your body and every organized cells of your body like the liver, the kidney or the intestines, those are we call them making an organ so they’re actually organized. I guess you would call it there you go that’s good. Anyway how is the liver affected differently than the kidneys, we’ll look it up. What does the liver represent? Long-term deep anger and frustration. What do kidneys? Current anger. They’re affected by two different things. Two different frequencies because they’re different and the aura field, you put your hand over a healthy liver it’s going to feel different than you put your hand over a healthy kidney or unhealthy. That’s one of the ways people like with the different techniques of helping someone what’s that? Reiki. You’re a Reiki master, right? You’re feeling that. Your hand goes on the top of someone and you feel it. The more sensitive you are the more your radars going to pick up. Like someone is doing Reiki they’re sensitive because they’re doing Reiki but they’ll come over let’s just say they’ll go down over the stomach and they feel sudden change. They may not know why because their gift picks up the stomach there’s something wrong but they don’t pick up what it is. That’s how’s it affecting it. Why other people will come down the same person gets to the stomach and they’ll feel something wrong and they’ll get vision or they’ll get knowledge because their sensors can pick up. Say the one person that can pick up the change, maybe they can pick up the aura field, their amygdala can pick it up 40 minutes of a second. Where the one who is bringing feeling the change and then get a feeling inside their body, that maybe 50 minutes of a second I’m saying or they make it a vision that maybe 80 minutes of a second or they make it all of them that maybe 200 minutes of a second. They’re picking up on this subtle frequencies. Information’s there. That’s like the difference in practitioners. They all learn different things within their abilities and it’s valid but it’s also why some people are mistaken. Not on purpose, but they have the ability to let’s say feel that stomach, but they can’t get it like I do and get more information so the starting point technique that’s say, “Okay, do you feel this?” Now you’re come in from this angle or something like that. You start applying ego based information. It’s not innocent anymore because you’re applying technique and is the information valid? Possibly. But it can also be invalid or not necessarily invalid but incomplete which makes it less useful. It’s not, I guess it doesn’t make them valid it just makes it less useful. \xa0 [39:41] Ashley James:\xa0What if someone feels like the gifts to upsight or knowledge or the ability to let’s say, put their hand over someone’s aura or in their aura and receive information and they want to develop that. How do you develop it without bringing the ego in?\xa0 I mean how do you put ego aside and just be that vessel for the information? \xa0 [40:06] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Unfortunately, there’s not a lot of people around to help with that. It is very specifically, it is soul progression that opens up those gifts. If you’re going to learn new technique that’s not a soul progression. Soul progression is when you come to a guy like me and you start seeing what is limiting the flow of the person’s lifetime. If you can eliminate that all of a sudden, the flow speeds up and gifts that they used in the past lives or gifts that are possibly there for them start to be attainable again because they’ve gotten out those low frequencies of pride and ego and human drama. Now their energy field can reach out farther. Literally, start picking up those subtle energies more and more and more. With people that are gifted that don’t particularly know it or they’re limited by it. By doing their background work, I call it their psychology increases their ability to process the information. They’ve sought out information – \xa0 [41:21] Ashley James:\xa0When you say information, it’s the sixth sense? \xa0 [41:25] Eric Thorton:\xa0 The sixth sense. Correct. \xa0 [41:26] Ashley James:\xa0The information being we’re receiving a vision or receiving intuition that we’re receiving information that is not sight or sound. \xa0 [41:36] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right and I mentor those people. We go back and forth with emails and things like that so that we can, the guides like doing this for people because it helps them understand what is real versus what is egoic and imagination. There’s a big difference but unless there’s a medicine woman or man around to help you discern the differences, these very subtle differences you’re going to confuse them. That for most people get stucked. The guides aren’t going to increase anyone’s gift when it’s in confusion because it causes karma. The guides just go, “Okay, that’ll work through that.” However, they work through that will be there to help them with the next level once they work through that. It can be things from everything affects the aura field. Past life, future life, current life in every way. I’m sitting next to a fish tank that’s affecting my aura field. We can sit there and look this way and feel the fish swim. I can’t anyway because it’s moving in my aura field and they have an aura field. So we pick it it’s in the matrix it’s called by the new age and it’s there. So if you can tune into that fine level, that level you can feel the fish swimming back and forth. That is why fish tanks are so calming for people. They don’t know they’re feeling it but they’re feeling it’s movement. Very subtle movement back and forth and it’s very calming to the human ego to have an innocent movement with no opinion attached to it. It’s very calming. In the aura field, we have something that’s dynamic in the aura field. It’s very agitating for some people opposite might begin possession. Four year olds can [Laughter] Yes, can’t wait to be a grandpa. Anyway, [Laughter] If they start to affecting my aura field too much I can send them home. [Laughter] That’s a bitter way to be a grandparent. Looking forward to it one day. \xa0 [44:01] Ashley James:\xa0[Inaudible 03:43:56] once has said, “if I knew being a grandma will be so much fun, I’d have them first.” Have grandkids first. \xa0 [44:08] Eric Thorton:\xa0 I like that. \xa0 [44:10] Ashley James:\xa0There is a trainer of NLP. You now my background is in Neuro Linguistic Programming. \xa0 [44:16] Eric Thorton:\xa0 I find that fascinating. \xa0 [44:18] Ashley James:\xa0It is. It’s cool stuff. There’s a trainer in NLP who is blind and he can point to the people, the person with their hand up in the audience and it freaks out the audience because they have 50 people in the room and he said, “Any questions? Raise your hand if you have any questions.” They laughed. They think it’s a joke, someone raises their hand and he goes, “Yes, you?” they’re like, “What? How’d he do that?” They know he’s blind. They’re like, “You’re lying here. You’re not blind.” He says, this is one thing we learned to become a trainer in NLP. We learn how to –\xa0 in NLP trainer’s training, we learn how to put our aura into expand our aura energy into the full training room so that we can feel the intension of all of these students. We can sense out which student’s going to be the troublemakers. There’s always one. Even in the classroom, there’s always going to be one trouble maker especially if you’re teaching in NLP because it could challenge the ego, right? There’s always some person that’s going to try to distract the class. And these are all outs that pay thousands of dollars to be there to take an NLP class and yet there’s always that one student. I guess see if they can shake or rattle the trainer. Right? See if they can overthrow the class in a way and go to NLP trainers will have already known exactly who they are because you could feel in it in the aura field. It’s part of my training in NLP we learned to put our aura out into the room, feel that the students and to a point where we can really feel which ones have questions, which ones are in confusion, which ones totally got the lesson. You can feel it. It’s part of being connected as a teacher to the class. \xa0 [46:18] Eric Thorton:\xa0 interesting thing with that is the teacher as you’ve heard me say, I don’t like to meditate or work in groups because when you expand the energy like that if your frequency is anywhere near someone else’s in the room, you have the ability to give them your problems and they have the ability to give you their problems. And so, if you can see that, and you can be, what we want is our aura field to be glass. That things that aren’t not ours just pass right through us. Most people aren’t anywhere near that and they end up getting polluted more when they do that. It starts coming into the energy field. They don’t make the association with the class because the energy they pick up from someone else is stuck to them like glue on a surface hasn’t gone in yet. Two or three weeks later, they may start feeling like crap because that energy is slowly worked its way in. \xa0 [47:30] Ashley James:\xa0Is that when at first year of college everyone gains 15 pounds? \xa0 [47:34] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Definitely help it, yes. [Laughter] You’re sharing. \xa0 [47:38] Ashley James:\xa0Everyone’s sharing. \xa0 [47:39] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Sharing that stress. \xa0 [47:40] Ashley James:\xa0Sharing their problems in an energetic level. \xa0 [47:45] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Well, they just changed their entire life. They moved from home to college. They’re like, “Woohoo! Oh my god.” all at the same time. When we feel upset, we want satiation. When we do it through food. Oftentimes. \xa0 [48:05]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Coming back you said when we’re in a class. It can be any class, it can be driver’s ED, it can be in church, any group of people we can take on other people’s problems that are in thought forms, people aura, why is that? It doesn’t feel like that would be beneficial for our evolution or is it? \xa0 [48:34] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Well, it’s fine if you’re the teacher, healer kind of help for the individual because it’s like sometimes with people while I’m working with one on one, I’ll feel what’s going on it means I am at their frequency with that. I can sit there and I know that and I know what to do with it. I know it’s not my own body’s and I tell my body that so it doesn’t it looks at the super subtle frequencies and goes, “Okay, that’s not mine. Most can’t do that. You sit there in the energy field and light energy comes together. How many different types of frustration are there? but they’re all the same energy of frustration but then there may be a hundred thousand different types of frustration but it’s till frustration. Then in a situation like that you can very easily take on a person’s frustration because maybe you’re frustrated with something totally different but it’s the frequency of frustration. There’s also there’s thought forms with it. There’s of predatory energy and demons of frustration and depending on what your frustration is and this other person’s frustration the closer they are together the more likely and the more quickly you can absorb this other person’s information. You know when you get to someone and you’re talking with, “Wow, the same things happen in your life.” You call that co-miserating but literally you’re bouncing your energy it’s the same with each other and you can exchange energy and pretty soon you know what each other’s talking about. It’s all the aura field. [50:12] Ashley James:\xa0My teacher, Ted James of no relation. He would say that he does not think that support groups are beneficial because for example anger management. You’re getting a bunch of people who are angry to get together and hang out and think that better at anger because they’re all talking about their anger feeling off but they’re not actually learning to heal it or resolve it. They learn strategies. \xa0 [50:39] Eric Thorton:\xa0 That’s the benefit of it. \xa0 [50:41] Ashley James:\xa0That’s the benefit of it, right when you get a bunch of angry people together. they’re all – crosstalk \xa0 [50:46] Eric Thorton:\xa0 They can go south. \xa0 [50:48] Ashley James:\xa0He says that you know, its’- \xa0 [50:50]\xa0Eric Thorton:\xa0 You can learn coping mechanisms as well as learning new mechanism for anger. The information isn’t specific. When you’re picking up intuition. It’s not going to, “Well, I don’t want to pick up this type but not this type.” No. You’re picking it up through intuition so if you’re going to about a group of angry people, you’re picking up the other people’s anger and their techniques. \xa0 [51:14] Ashley James:\xa0You really want to be very clear on who you hang out with. \xa0 [51:18] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Well, it is. You have depending on where you are. Like if you’re just out of prison because you beat people up, a support group would be good. Maybe you’ve got to learn you know I got them in trouble etc. and it might be a good idea to not, “Oh, I’m not the only one in the universe with this problem and this is how they’re dealing with it and they’re doing with it.” that’s great. Alcoholic Anonymous. That’s great to have the groups. People just explain their feelings. Men never explain their feelings so sometimes a man’s group will help them teach them words language for explaining their feelings but when you start getting into the detail of the subtle energies within those groups. The subtle energies within those groups, that’s when you start developing those problems. As a group develops, the more they get to know each better the more dangerous it becomes. I like AA’s. I mean I don’t need to go to AA. But I like AA, you don’t use your full name and they don’t know each other. The person who developed that was very intelligent because the more you know each other, the more you converse each other between meetings. Which they do not encourage that at all. The more you do it, the more you’re going to co-miserate and the more energies going to circulate around that’s when it keeps people stuck. This is why, AA I don’t know if they did it on purpose, intentionally or they develop that out of intuition but that not sharing your name and not being with each other between meetings, not being buddies with anybody – \xa0 [53:10] Ashley James:\xa0Well, it’ll be easy to go to the bar together. \xa0 [53:12] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Exactly. \xa0 [53:14] Ashley James:\xa0Right. Pull each other down. We want to be the people that are a little bit more involved. Hopefully. \xa0 [53:23] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Like energy comes together. People who don’t have any interest in the spiritual world they have no frequency for it. No ability to pick up on it. \xa0 [53:36] Ashley James:\xa0They probably aren’t listening at this point. [Crosstalk] \xa0 [53:40]\xa0Eric Thorton:\xa0They aren’t listening. They’re shut down. Right. You can feel that. You go, “Okay, I don’t want to hang out with you.” Then but they also don’t want to hang out with you because you’re so opposite of energies. It’s a sword. A double-edged sword this thing is because it stops and it enhances but if you know it’s there and you know you can use it the homeostasic level, the various levels of the aura field, they reflect everything that’s going on. The more fine tune you get to your own feeling, the more that your aura field the more you can help yourself. \xa0 [54:18] Ashley James:\xa0You give the picture of the homeostasic field and you talked about the other – \xa0 [54:25] Eric Thorton:\xa0Electro magnetic, one of them. \xa0 [54:27] Ashley James:\xa0Electromagnetic. Can you tell us about all the levels of the aura? What they’re for? \xa0 [54:32] Eric Thorton:\xa0Different people call them different things. Let’s get that probably right now. Semantics it’s all over the board. There’s another layer that I’ve been given a word by the photon layer. That other people use that one too. \xa0 [54:48] Ashley James:\xa0When you say you’re given, just to be clarify for those who hadn’t listened to all those other episodes you had with us which they should because they’re fascinating, you since birth have been able to talk to guides and the angel. \xa0 [54:59] Eric Thorton:\xa0 The angels and guides. Right. \xa0 [55:00] Ashley James:\xa0And they give you the words and talk to you and – \xa0 [55:05] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right and then I love it when I see it out there because they give me universal knowledge so I should run in to the same words out there. \xa0 [55:14] Ashley James:\xa0Funny side story that you told me. That thing is hilarious. Your guides used to give you a book to buy. They told you what it look like and what’s the name and what’s the everything and you couldn’t find it for, what was it? Five years? \xa0 [55:25] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Five years, yes. \xa0 [55:28] Ashley James:\xa0 And then you finally found it. It’s because it hadn’t been published yet. And you were like, “Okay guys, listen here. There’s something here called timing. I know you like date using guides were on a different plain but time is relevant but for us.” \xa0 [55:41] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Five years looking for a book. \xa0 [55:43]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Five years looking for a book that hadn’t been published yet. \xa0 [55:48] Eric Thorton:\xa0 It was being developed and written and they wanted me to have it. [Laughter] They were looking at the future and it’s there because someone was writing and it was going be down one day. It was the book, Animals Spirit Guides by Steven Farmer. I believe it is. Anyway, it was like, he was developing the book. \xa0 [56:13] Ashley James:\xa0 That’s funny. So they gave you the name by a photon which is a layer of the aura. What is it? \xa0 [56:20] Eric Thorton:\xa0 The bio photon affects it’s the – the reason that word is chosen it was been chosen by other people as well other guides because that’s what they’ve got. It’s the very specifically, the energy that is being radiated from the nucleus of every cell. It’s what give your body heat. Your self-producing energy using a different protein molecules. Where there’s amino acids, for example the L-Theanine, I think it is. I may have it wrong. Attaches to the end of the double helix when its ready to divide, it really plugs in like a receptacle like you’re plugging something into a wall receptacle. It feeds this the double helix and it starts to spin at the speed of light creating heat. In the bio photon, we can see that. See what is developing specifically, how the cells are dividing, what genes are being activated, what’s not and you can bring the body back to the information of something being new like you’re a newborn. \xa0 [57:47] Ashley James:\xa0Like the blueprints of perfect health and healing. \xa0 [57:52] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. So you take the bio photon field and you’ll see, right in there you’ll see little subtle like little switches the bio photon field I see it is more like a cloud but not negative. Not something bad. It’s telling me the health of the reproduction of every cell and every gene that’s being activated and isn’t. There’s a lot of information there. Healers can be used to modify that to bring it back to innocence. The body isn’t innocent anymore because it’s not a newborn. The body has this frequency you adjust the bio photon to bring it back to the innocent level and the body starts going, “Oh, I need to go that direction.” This is one of the ways you can get the body to heal itself is by you’re not only going in and do whatever the guide just saying on the very subtle levels and major levels but at the end of the session, we take the bio photon field and restore it to innocence. And you’ll see at the end of the session, I stand behind you and above you, you’re laying down, I stand behind your head and I literally just take this energy and wipe that bio photon field to make it innocent again. Then any healing that is in there will remain longer because the healing is also innocent like the bio photon field. If you want something like if a person has cancer, sometimes it heals overnight. Spontaneous healing with the work we do. \xa0 [59:43] Ashley James:\xa0Like with your brother. \xa0 [59:44] Eric Thorton:\xa0Like with my brother and a number of other people that we’ve been through. Sometimes it’s a progression and that bio photon field has got to remain separate in a healthy form whether it’s adopting the frequencies of the cancer. You keep that bio photon field innocent so the body starts going, “Oh, this cancer cell doesn’t belong.” It starts to recognize that that doesn’t belong and then the body will attack it and get rid of it. That’s ultimately how you have to cure cancer and if the body just won’t do it. It’s because it’s their time to go. It’s obvious and because if it’s your time to check out, if you get cancer and you’re going to check out that way, I don’t recommend it. If you’re going to check out that way that aren’t going to change it. I’m not going to allow it because that’s how you’re supposed to die. We look at that as humans and the animal parts of us looks at that as panic. The aura field would change from that. That’s the worst thing you’ll do because it puts out all that negative energy you’ll never if you learn the lesson form the cancer it won’t change because you got panic in it. You don’t own your cancer. \xa0 [01:01:08] Ashley James:\xa0Just to clarify. If someone has, it’s their life’s path and they chose before they came here. This is how they want to go, they want to go from cancer there’s nothing we can do. That’s how they decided it they want to go – \xa0 [01:01:23] Eric Thorton:\xa0In the end result. \xa0 [01:01:26] Ashley James:\xa0Right. But if someone has cancer and they didn’t chose but that’s how they go. You have cancer and they can live another 50 years but they’ve got to get rid of the cancer. You’re saying that if there’s panic in the aura, because the animal part of our body’s freaking out word about death and resisting and panicking about it even if they gained the positive learnings and do the emotional healing work that healing won’t take place in the body because the panic in the aura is still present. \xa0 [01:02:02] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right.That’s why we have to sometimes in the work we do, we give people homework, we give people suggestions on how to get the deep subconscious to not panic. \xa0 [01:02:17] Ashley James:\xa0When you’re saying we, you’re talking you and the guides? \xa0 [01:02:20] Eric Thorton:\xa0\xa0 And the guides. Whenever I use the word we, I’m not deferring from me. I’m including me. Because a lot of times people use we as a mental illness. \xa0 [01:02:27] Ashley James:\xa0No. I didn’t mean that. \xa0 [01:02:28] Eric Thorton:\xa0\xa0 I’m using it as literally a “we”. Got myself and the guides. As a therapist, I know that can be a disassociate disorder. This isn’t that. \xa0 [01:02:43] Ashley James:\xa0Like “we” as in you and the person you’re healing. I’m just clarifying, or “we” as in all healer? \xa0 [01:02:52] Eric Thorton:\xa0\xa0 No, me and the guides and angels. Right. Their job if there’s time because if that person has cancer and they’re not able to get rid of it and they’re not really generally have to die from it. There’s still the back log of past life and learning that’s preventing them currently form being able to not own that cancer from being able to get rid of it and it’s also subconscious. One of the things science has finally discovered. Things like mushrooms and the alistine. Even MD, whatever they call it, it’s ecstasy. They have hallucigens. In therapeutic amounts, it can open up that subconscious mind. \xa0 [01:03:41] Ashley James:\xa0With a doctor, with a therapist. \xa0 [01:03:43] Eric Thorton:\xa0 With a doctor and a therapist definitely. [Crosstalk] You don’t go and do it on your own. \xa0 [01:03:49] Ashley James:\xa0There are therapies in which they think this is they give them therapy dose or alistine or mushrooms or ecstasy but it’s a different dose than someone probably high from it. \xa0 [01:04:00] Eric Thorton:\xa0\xa0 You don’t get high from it. \xa0 [01:04:01] Ashley James:\xa0Very minimal. It opens up the brain. \xa0 [01:04:06] Eric Thorton:\xa0It opens up the subconscious mind to subtleties that they’re so distant and foreign to you that you can’t go there. It just won’t allow you to go there on a personal talk therapy situation and typical healing session. This is where guides will go in and go into those levels and go, “Okay, they’ll go into those levels and they’ll go into the bio photon electromagnetic and go into what’s affecting the DNA subconsciously that’s so far back that you can’t get through it. Bring that forward and then all of a sudden physical changes take place. I’ll use me as an example. I did the therapy and the first time I did it, I saw myself canned in a jar. I was a kid it was when my brother died. It’s on my book. I took everything prior to my brother dying including my memories and I canned them. I had no idea but it’s a coping mechanism, my subconscious mind did so I could be in the moment when my brother died instead of being in the tragedy of losing this whole life. It blocked out all the joy we had, all the interaction in the family so I could be in the here and now and my brain could heal itself for this major tragedy. Here I’m 58 years old and I still have my childhood memories and I don’t know why. I’ve had many therapies worked with me, I’ve had many healers work with me. It’s just my systems wasn’t going to go there because it was content with it. It’s like scar tissues if your body doesn’t recognize it anymore, it’s content with it. It’s not up to be healed. But I still didn’t have the memories. This came up and I took this out and we did EMDR lifestyle integration etc. with it and did the other energetic work with it as well and literally all my childhood memories are back. Every single one of them. The system had taken it. The aura field had taken it in. That’s okay, right there. I don’t have to deal with that in a jar on a shelf. It’s okay. \xa0 [01:07:02] Ashley James:\xa0I had the same thing happen to me at my mom’s death. There’s a huge chunk of my life missing. Over time, also it’s too painful to go back, think about her before she died for a good while I’ve had a lot of emotional work. But I had a friend from childhood ask me, “Do you remember such and such..” I’m like, the entire part of my life’s like. My brain was like, “This is too painful. Putting it away for later.” Yes, you did this therapeutic mushrooms basically with a doctor and you don’t get high from it. It opens up the brain, the unconscious and let’s you work on things and heal things. \xa0 [01:07:51] Eric Thorton:\xa0 That we haven’t been able to get to because the body is content with it. \xa0 [01:07:55] Ashley James:\xa0How is that? When the brain suppresses memories, how was that related to the aura field? \xa0 [01:08:04] Eric Thorton:\xa0\xa0 It’s suppressing the aura field. \xa0 [01:08:05] Ashley James:\xa0So you could see it in your aura field or other? \xa0 [01:08:08] Eric Thorton:\xa0 I could see it. I could look at it. I couldn’t get the knowledge from it. I knew it was there because it’s the work I do that type of thing, I talked about it. I processed my brother death etc. it just the body say, “We don’t have to go there.” because it was a defense mechanism. \xa0 [01:08:32] Ashley James:\xa0When you look at someone’s aura field, can you see trauma? Emotional trauma from the past? \xa0 [01:08:36] Eric Thorton:\xa0 If we turn that on, yes. We have to turn on the layers and so depends whether guides lead me. Sometime they would lead me to that level in session. Sometimes they don’t. It depends they have to do the combination that’s going to unlock the person and that’s not necessary to open it up and have them become aware and enlighten the conscious. It’s not necessary to open that up. \xa0 [01:09:06] Ashley James:\xa0 When we clear the bio photon field within our aura, is that you’re saying that that is the level which we can hold on disease? The whole aura can hold on to the disease. \xa0 [01:09:20] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes. The whole aura can hold on to the disease. Each layer you might call it. For the sake of discussion, we call them layers. They’re all intermingled. It’s like the way the aura field works is like if you had a room full of balls. Basketballs. They’re all touching but they’re not combining. One basketball is yellow, one basketball is red, one basketball is green, one is bright green. They don’t combine. They can all exist in the same space without combining. When people say the aura is this specific color or shakra is this specific color. Well, they’re all seeing the red basketballs, they’re not seeing the green ones in it or the yellow ones in it. Our aura field is dynamic. There is no specific color to a specific anything. It depends on what is going on with it at that moment. If you’re angry, your liver’s fired up because you’re angry from something from long time ago in the current moment that’s going to have red basketballs versus green ones if you want to say it. But they’re all there but they do not combine. It’s like when we go with that bio photon, we’re taking out the I’m trying to get an analogy that would work for that. We’re taking out the stench. That’s kind of weird I get. Like the red basketballs they’re going to be angry, frustrated just like the other. While all the red basketballs but they don’t have to be active. So we wipe out the stench you may say so they’ll becomes the same smelling and everything starts working together again. They all become the same frequency but they’re also red basketballs, green basketballs, yellow basketballs. When the red ones are standing out, I hear that goes, “Oh, this person has anger. This person had a possession in this part of the aura field.” Because you’re looking at what it’s doing, what it’s reflecting. How it’s being affected by the energy. When I go through at the end of the sessions we go through and we clear that bio photon, it brings it up to date to what’s just been done in the body and in the aura field it brings all up to date and the healing will continue far longer after they leave the space. That particular dynamics of that aura field. Now the aura field also goes inward. You hear about the inner shakras. \xa0 [01:12:14] Ashley James:\xa0I thought shakras were in the body anyway? They’re in and out or they go through the whole body. \xa0 [01:12:19] Eric Thorton:\xa0 They go through the whole body but the inward shakra – Shakras are part of the energy of the body the physical energy of the body and when they join with the soul’s physical energy. Within that dynamic they’re separate from your body. The aura reaches out. Can reach out for miles and miles depending on what needs to be done. Like if you’re a scout out looking for an enemy, it‘s going to reach out for 30 miles and have you, “Oh, I need to head to that direction.” Or if you’re in the supermarket doesn’t need to go out that far. \xa0 [01:12:57] Ashley James:\xa0I’m looking for the pickles. [Laughter] \xa0 [01:12:59] Eric Thorton:\xa0 It’s not this aisle. “Oh yes, it’s right here.” It’s dynamic, it giving you information, and the clearer that is the more accurate it’s going to be. The inner shakra is the exact same thing except it gets smaller and smaller and smaller. If you think about the analogy they’ve shown it on Facebook you get this things, it shows a cell on the earth they start expanding that into the full universe. \xa0 [01:13:28] Ashley James:\xa0Oh, the video. \xa0 [01:13:31] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. Same thing goes inward. You’ve got to get to bio photon in the inwards side as well not just with that here. You’ve got it’s like you’ve got a horizon line in the middle of your aura field. What’s inward and what is outward. They’re both equally important. This is the part of healing that I haven’t heard anybody do at this point where they’re actually balancing both sides of this horizon line like [Inaudible 01:14:04] \xa0 [01:14:05] Ashley James:\xa0The aura that’s inside our body versus outside. \xa0 [01:14:09] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Is the same as the outside but it’s going inward. \xa0 [01:14:15] Ashley James:\xa0 In each cell? \xa0 [01:14:17] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Into each cell. This is a hard concept for humans and science to really understand because we think of things physically. The aura field exists in what science would call the non-physical space. It’s not. It’s very physical. But we think of things when they get smaller as contacting and actually being smaller. They’re not. It’s just to the human way of thinking, it’s getting smaller. It’s just as big as the universe. If you don’t work with both sides of that at some point, the healings aren’t going to hold. If they have the possibility of holding. They will not hold because you’ve got one portion that’s one frequency now that’s really healthy and the inwards portion that’s not. You have to balance the bio photon for example on both sides of the middle point where it exists. Otherwise, it’s not going to hold. so it’s not going to be as effective in changing the cells of the physical body. \xa0 [01:15:37] Ashley James:\xa0How do we do that? How do we make sure that our outward inward auras are balanced? \xa0 [01:15:46] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Well, part of my process with talking to the public is to put it out there because people have different points of view and if they know like with Reiki, if you know there’s something there you can affect it with intention. You can affect it with knowledge as well and if people start looking at that inner part you’re going to get a million people’s ideas on how to approach that and then you’re going to get a better healing process throughout the planet. I have one person’s assets of healing. I love other people’s aspect of healing. I love it, people’s aspect of healing because it’s so interesting from their point of view of the same thing. That’s how you get a body of information. The body of information so far has been on the aura field that we look outward at. So far there’s not a lot of body of information from the aura field of what is inward. I mentioned it from people from time to time so they can have it in their head so that they can start getting information for that. I don’t know how to teach that. \xa0 [01:16:56] Ashley James:\xa0Yet. But you do. You do teach – \xa0 [01:17:01] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Just putting it out there is teaching. \xa0 [01:17:04] Ashley James:\xa0Sure. You mentored people one on one who are healers. \xa0 [01:17:10] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Who are healers and I can teach them when their site opens up to that level how to use that and they will use that through their expression which is different with mine and the knowledge continues to open up to it. It’s fantastic to watch something like that develop. Because that’s what were supposed to do as healers is pulling out these different aspects and then find out the whole. That’s like I say that’s what I hope to be doing by some of this interviews and talks I do. I’m going to die. This body’s going to die. \xa0 [01:17:52] Ashley James:\xa0Eventually. Moving to another realm. \xa0 [01:17:54] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Maybe. Maybe not. You know, to me it’s great whatever happens. It’s going to do that. I’d like to come back to a better place. There’s a little bit of ego for me if I keep putting it out there people, are going to go, “Oh” and they’re going to mix in their perspective and it’s going to bring out this massive knowledge of information by all these people’s perspective. So yes, it’s a challenge to people. Let’s look at the inner auras. The inner auras of the shakras and the inner auras of every cell and the inner auras of every atom and see what can be done with that. Now things that affect all the way around are sound. Sound affects the inner and outer of auras. There’s some really dynamic people that do a lot of sound therapy. If you can find the tune for that person it really harmonizes both sides of that horizon line which we call the body. The inner and the outer. That’s fascinating to watch. I was just in talking with a guy a couple of days ago, and he does sound therapy. He thinks he has a gift. The guy was totally left brain scientific mind and he got told by a NASA engineer that he was gifted. He knew how to pull sounds together to make music that were extremely harmonizing and healing. It’s fascinating. Talk to the guy. \xa0 [01:19:39] Ashley James:\xa0Does he sell his music? \xa0 [01:19:42] Eric Thorton:\xa0 He does. I might give him your name and stuff so that you can interview him and he’s in California. I’m totally drawing a blank out of his name right now because I’d like to give him a little boost. It was this guy we used to have a couple of hours conversation and we talked and we checked see if we can work with each other things like that. The sound therapy can help get into those little packages up on the wall that the body has said, “Okay, its fine up on my wall. We’ll just leave it there.” It can help bring that out into light of day so we can deal with it. It needs to be in a professional way because if something comes out and you’re processing on your own, you have no idea how to do that. It goes right back on to the wall. You need to have someone to help you walk though it that’s trained on some level to do that. Anyway, this levels of the aura field are definitely reflecting the root base causes of the end results of illness we have. Like a sore arm, in result of all these other things. Depending on the sight, sound ability, gift ability of the practitioner is how far back you get. I can say everything affects the aura field. As we get into the what would be the right, the aspects of the aura field that affects us every single day that we all use every single day. If you bring a let’s say a person is allergic to corn. If he bring corn close to the aura field, it’s going to react or if you pull in the idea of corn, it’s going to react. This is where dowsing contest strength testing. Contest if you’re weak or strong with corn. It’s affecting the aura field. The aura of the corn is affecting your aura field and if you’re allergic to it. It makes you physically weak. \xa0 [01:22:08] Ashley James:\xa0I was in, I think it’s called Janell’s Gluten-Free Market in Woodinville. We were grabbing something because our whole family is gluten–free but we don’t eat processed food that often but we are getting something for our son that we couldn’t find anywhere else because they have vegan bread there because he has egg and dairy allergy and so they have gluten free vegan bread. It’s just hard to find and this one woman was saying that she’s allergic to XYZ and there’s always breads and she didn’t know which one would be good for her and I asked her, “Have you ever done muscle testing?” and she looked at me like I had two heads and she was open to it. I said, “Okay, well of course.” The clerk behind, oh man, he gave a look. He was afraid like I was about to grow two heads. [Crosstalk] \xa0 [01:23:05] Eric Thorton:\xa0 A big worm comes out of your stomach. [Laughter] \xa0 [01:23:06] Ashley James:\xa0Exactly. He was looking at me like very afraid. She put down her basket and I said, “Okay.” I showed her. I said, “Put your arm out beside you.” and I pushed on it just to show her there’s so much pressure. I’m going to push and said, “Think of something you hate.” and I pushed down and her arm becomes weak and I said, “Think about something you love.” pushed on her arm and it becomes strong. I said, “Okay now, close your eyes.” I handed her one of the loaves of bread so she couldn’t be biased, she’d know which one I handed her and I pushed on her arm and then we did it with the other one. I think we might have tested three but she was amazed that the one where her arm went weak and she was just holding her arm and also she couldn’t even hold her arm up anymore. As I was putting very little pressure on and that’s muscle testing. There’s always the concern that there’s biased because I could be pushing five pounds of weight with the other because I have unconscious biased towards what brand is better. \xa0 [01:24:11] Eric Thorton:\xa0 That’s why you can’t sell a product and use muscle testing. I hear biased. \xa0 [01:24:19] Ashley James:\xa0Because you’re biased right? Because you might believe you’re going to push more but if there’s was some way to do muscle testing where either person didn’t know what it was. \xa0 [01:24:29] Eric Thorton:\xa0 That’s right. Exactly. That’s why muscle testing affects the aura field so much it is unbelievable. This is where we get – \xa0 [01:24:36] Ashley James:\xa0You mean the aura affects muscle testing. \xa0 [01:24:39] Eric Thorton:\xa0 The aura affects muscle testing and the products that you’re testing for or the ideas that you’re testing for affects the aura. Which gives you the strength or the weakness. Well, let’s apply that a little farther with the aura field. If a loaf of bread, you can test a loaf of bread and this is why, I’m going to digress for a moment. This is the very reason why I do whole food plant-based. \xa0 [01:25:08] Ashley James:\xa0Just for those who don’t know what that is. You eat a whole food plant-based diet meaning, not only are you vegan but you choose to not eat processed foods. Because lots of vegans out there that eat beyond burger. Plant-based whole food meaning food that’s whole form not processed and plant-based meaning far from animals. I’ve had a lot of interviews about whole food plant-based\xa0 that’s what I eat and my husband eats and we do our best. Usually we have something out of a can or whatever but some processed foods the more whole food the more non adulterated – \xa0 [01:25:51] Eric Thorton:\xa0 You’re not sucking a nutrient out of something. Like olive oils great for you and olives. \xa0 [01:25:55] Ashley James:\xa0Eat the whole freaking olive. Don’t squeeze the oil out of it because you’re removing the fiber and anytime you remove the fiber – \xa0 [01:26:03] Eric Thorton:\xa0 But it’s not only that. Your body doesn’t know what to do with oil versus oil in the olive with the whole ingredient. Your body can digest an entire olive. The oil is water soluble, you pull the oil out of it, it is no longer water-soluble and the body doesn’t have an idea what to do with it. We need the EFAs, the DHAs and all those stuff from the olive oils the omegas but those are chemicals. They’re not oil. You can get them other ways by eating the olive one way. \xa0 [01:26:33] Ashley James:\xa0One of the reasons why you chose to eat whole foods plant-based? \xa0 [01:26:36] Eric Thorton:\xa0Right. It’s because of the aura field. If you said the vitamin C, it’s not going to work for me if I take it in pill form and you test it you’re going to be weak with the vitamin C that comes from an orange but you’d be strong with it that comes from pill. Because of your belief system. \xa0 [01:27:00] Ashley James:\xa0Your belief system affects your aura. \xa0 [01:27:04] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Correct. This is why reductionism is a vicious cycle. If you say you need magnesium for something which we do, but if you believe that you have to take it in a pill form, when you eat the mushroom which is the highest source of magnesium your body won’t use it. It’ll only use the magnesium in the – some of the magnesium you take in a capsule form but the mushroom form is a thousand times better than the capsule form. In other words, we literally change according to our thought process, our aura field changes. Reductionism which is plain, it’s taking a product and taking\xa0 specific thing out of it saying this is what’s good for you and that instead of eating the entire product. If you need vitamin C, if you eat an apple to get your vitamin C while scientifically the apple has 50mg of vitamin C in it but if you eat the whole apple because all the dynamic is in that apple for making vitamin C, when you eat the whole apple you’ll have a 1500mg raise in vitamin C in your bloodstream. Not 50 or science can only see 50mg of it because your body uses, the aura field uses all the information in the apple to produce what your body needs. Dr. Yeo something who got a Pulitzer Prize for this study over 20 years over 300,000 people watching whole food versus broken down foods does in your body. Your whole aura field changes. When you put a vitamin C pill in you, your aura field doesn’t know what to do with it or you put an apple in your aura field, your body doesn’ t know what to do with it. The whole piece of vitamin C or vitamin A or this subtle thing here, so many people are selling products to make money because if it’s vitamin C and an apple’s good for you, let’s pull it out and get it in pill form so I can make money out of it. Because there’s no money in selling apple except to farmers and middle man. There’s no money for anybody else, you sit here and reductionism takes this object and makes it foreign to your aura field and it has no idea what to do with it so your body doesn’t pay attention. \xa0 [01:29:41] Ashley James:\xa090% at the grocery store really confuses the aura field. All the processed foods. \xa0 [01:29:47] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Totally. That’s why you hear people saying we need to eat seasonally partially, we need to because squash digest better in the fall that it does in the spring because of the aura of the squash. It’s ripe, it’s ready, it’s fresh. You go out you kick that like your zucchini it’s so much different than something sitting around for 6 months then coming out in the spring. Squash in the spring is very different energetically than squash in the fall. Your body will get very different things from it because the aura field tells your body how to digest it. Things that are reduced your aura field has no idea what to do with it. You watch someone eat something inorganic or you watch someone eat something that is reduced and their aura field just gets confused. It has no idea. You get some of it but you don’t get that mm feeling inside of you. It just it feels so good. \xa0 [01:30:52] Ashley James:\xa0Like the soup I brought today? \xa0 [01:30:52] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Just like the soup you brought today. \xa0 [01:30:55] Ashley James:\xa0I’ll include the recipe. I’ve made a soup right before coming here and put it in mason jars and we’ve been drinking it before the interview and it’s amazing. No oil, no salt. It’s creamy and it’s rich and it’s so delicious. \xa0 [01:31:10] And\xa0it’s full of flavors. \xa0 [01:31:11] Ashley James:\xa0And full of nutrition. \xa0 [01:31:12] Eric Thorton:\xa0 And all that affects your aura field. That’s a particular one. You’ve figured out a formula for helping to wake you up. It’s just you wanted something this morning that would wake you up so your aura field tuned in to that. What was in the refrigerator and in your spice cup and everything. You start dumping it together and you came up for this elixir for the interview so were both awake and everything for the interview. That’s all aura field. It’s telling you what to put in that. \xa0 [01:31:44] Ashley James:\xa0 I feel like when we have that discussion of quantum physics, it’s like the chicken and the egg. Our body and our soul are producing the aura field but it feels like the aura field has a life of it’s own. \xa0 [01:32:03] Eric Thorton:\xa0 They both have dynamics of their own but they are dependent on when the souls portion of the body has come together it creates life. It creates the dynamic of life and the flow of that. Everything affects that flow. That maybe what you’re talking about that dynamic it’s when they’re in harmony, that’s when you are in best health. When you’re in to do something that’s into the system whether it’s a thought or a chemical or a reduced something, it just causes static. It’s telling you to alert. Your body doesn’t know what to do with it. it’s like when you get and people who aren’t sensitive don’t know this but when you take a let’s just use food, when you take food that is raised organic and raised by a living hands, it digest differently than organic, raised on a safe way, giant safe way farm versus inorganic. Yes. Better to have the safe way than to have the inorganic but you can literally feel the way it changes your mood. If you would’ve taken this lovely soup you made this morning and you would’ve put safe way zucchini in it – [01:33:43] Ashley James:\xa0Instead of the you pick farm – \xa0 [01:33:44] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes, Exactly. It would be a different way. It affected us here today because the aura field has to deal with that. It changes it. It changes it completely. It changes the pheromones. It changes the alertness in the brain. It changes the feeling of well-being throughout your body. I tell people the closer to nature and the more loving anything is, the better it is for your body. It’s always best to eat the best quality you can possibly afford because I can say it’s better to have safe organic than not. Anyway, the aura field is part of your defense system. We talked about your immune system but it is when you have a foreign object in your aura field, foreign auras, foreign energy. Your field it can alert your immune system then it can also alert you to safety. This is why all mammals have this. Fish have a little different thing going on they’re not a mammal. Lizards and things like that. The cold blooded animals that are heated by their environment have a different type of aura field and they’re not as attuned. A fish has feelings nerve feelings but they don’t perceive things as someone’s going to cut my head off I bite that hook. It’s like, their nerve feelings if you took if you went fishing and you took the fish out of the water you’d be it’s still breathing because it still has moisture in its gills so it’s getting oxygen but it doesn’t have the ability to have fear. If you took – it’s going to get gross for a minute. kind of how we go on this subject but it’s going to get gross for a minute, if you sit there and if you’re going to behead a human, you have all this dynamic in the aura field and everything that takes place if that’s going happen versus a fish it’s like [Inaudible 01:36:08] dead. There just simply isn’t the perception and the ability that aura field to pick up on this type of thing. It still is different to damage to kill a fish than it is to cut a human. \xa0 [01:36:25] Ashley James:\xa0They experience it differently. \xa0 [01:36:27] Eric Thorton:\xa0 They experience it totally different. The aura experience it differently. The soul of the fish experiences it differently. It doesn’t hold resentment. It’s not going to affect them in the next life. They’re not going to be afraid of that fishhook in the next life as if they come back as a fish again. It’s because they never were afraid of it. That part of the aura field that brings us into memory. They don’t have a brain to do that. \xa0 [01:36:59] Ashley James:\xa0We can become afraid of accidents in the next life because you’re beheaded in the previous life and you can retain that. \xa0 [01:37:06] Eric Thorton:\xa0 We retain that very much so. \xa0 [01:37:09] Ashley James:\xa0Because you mentioned that our aura field also exhibits our past life experiences. \xa0 [01:37:14] Eric Thorton:\xa0Experiences. When you tap in the past life experiences, the aura field let’s say, a person was, I’ll go back to what I had. My brother died, I hang the stuff on the shelf, it was there I pretended I died it was still there. The next life, I come in that’s on the shelf I have no – in that life my bother may be hadn’t died and so it’s foreign object to me on that shelf. I have no way of even attaching to it but when maybe a friend’s brother dies and you start realizing your own mortality because of that then it wakes up because the aura field has now taken on the idea of death and it taps into past life. You now have unresolved death. Right around death unresolved ones and it picks up on that bottle that I had put on the shelf an all of a sudden I lose that memory of that life of the childhood. That’s how past life can affect us. It changes the aura field goes, “Oh my god, okay, stay. Keep that away. That’ll cause harm.” Memory of childhood causes harm if there’s early childhood death in the family and it’ll literally shut down off in the next life. And you go to therapist and he go, “Why?” I don’t know. No trauma’s ever happened. There must’ve been a trauma. You show all the signs of having trauma. Or I’ve never had a trauma. I’ve never anyone died never been abused. Whatever it was. Never had it and the therapist saying “You’re nuts.” because you’re literally showing all the signs of the trauma. It happens with rape situations from past life. People die when they’re being raped and then in the next life they don’t have a memory of it so the therapist will blame Dad or blame a brother when it was actually past life. \xa0It’s in the aura field that it was Dad or brother in the past life. A different dad or different brother in the past life. It’s brought in from the aura field as suppressed memory but it’s from different life and there’s no way to distinguish that for typical psychologist to distinguish that. The aura field it picks up on those subtleties to stay safe. This is picks up in my next life I haven’t processed this life stuff with my little brother it doesn’t want to have that pain again. The neighbor kids, the neighbor’s family, a person dies wake it up with me, “Don’t go there. You don’t want anyone to die.” he start getting this unreasonable fears we call them. So then the work we do, we can go back to that. Why they have this unreasonable fears. We’ve proven there’s nothing in this life that would cause those fears that is past life. Then you look at the aura field and you start going into the inner shakras or the other way where I’m directed to find those subtleties. They’re not for this life. They’re from the different life and then you pick those off the shelf and you look at those and you release it and you process it and then it release this current life from those feelings and you’ve processed, you’ve learned from it and it finishes that issues from past life and in that subsequent life after that life. You won’t have problems with it. Because you fully were able to deal with it. If in this life you weren’t able to get back to it, the following life it will happen too. We call this process karma. It’s not right or wrong it’s what you need to learn. I hadn’t learned yet it was still on the shelf. So that’ll keep coming to me again and again in future lives until I learned what was on the shelf. That is karma. It’s the learning process. It is people mix the idea of person and they’re very different. Send me, you missed the boat, you screwed up. You damaged yourself for somebody else. Karma is just learning. It can be found in the aura field. \xa0 [01:41:37] Ashley James:\xa0Very cool. So now, we got three layers and again not layers like a parfait layer like a – \xa0 [01:41:44] Eric Thorton:\xa0They’re distinct layer within the same – \xa0 [01:41:45] Ashley James:\xa0I was going to say smoothie. \xa0 [01:41:46] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Layers like a smoothie. Distinct molecule within the same jar. There’s another layer we call the Etheric layer. So far, we’ve been doing with what we call the astral layers. The layer one is very connected between the soul and the body and it’s very much to do with the physical life on the planet. Etheric is the soul’s portion of the aura. That gives you a whole another set of abilities and aspect to which to draw from for healing. Like for Etheric like astral travel people are travelling within the planet, you can learn people can be taught to astral travel and they can get real time information. Third travel is when you go out into the universe. You can travel that part of your soul can travel light years in seconds, in milliseconds. That’s one of the amazing dynamic things of the human soul in that aura field. This is how people will eventually time travel or eventually hit works. You don’t bring your body with you, that stays behind, the body cannot withstand those forces. But the soul can. Literally you can travel completely across the universe in milliseconds and this is one of the things that other species you might say are very jealous of with the human existence. \xa0 [01:43:32] Ashley James:\xa0You didn’t want to say the word, aliens. \xa0 [01:43:34] Eric Thorton:\xa0 No, I didn’t. [Laughter] this is one of the things they study with humans is how do we project that way and get real time information. Now there is no way to prove it except when you’re travelling etherically with somebody. Then you’re both seeing the same things. Then you say, “Oh, yes. I see that rock over here. I see this type of plant over here.” or “I see this type of lifeform over here.” You’re both talking about the same thing. \xa0 [01:44:10] Ashley James:\xa0We could both travel to mars and see the – \xa0 [01:44:15] Eric Thorton:\xa0 The polar iced caps. \xa0 [01:44:16] Ashley James:\xa0Or the robot on mars and read the serial number. \xa0 [01:44:19] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes. When you get good at it, you can get down with that detail. \xa0 [01:44:24] Ashley James:\xa0Then you can call up NASA and see if you’re right. \xa0 [01:44:26] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes. You can. If there’s a way to verify it. It’d be very interesting. That would be the way to do it. \xa0 [01:44:33] Ashley James:\xa0When I was a teenager, my boyfriend Ryan, who became a really good friend, still is. He lived in Newmarket and I lived in North York which is, it’s about 45 minutes away from me in Ontario. He was reading a book or something in astral travel. I’m one of those people that kind like reads the first chapter and thinks I can do it. I don’t need to read. I got it. okay, I’m going to meditate and I’m going to do this thing. I’d sat on the floor because I thought id have to have yoga positon with my knees crossed and I closed my eyes. I imagined a big vortex of light opening above me and I went in it. I ended up floating right outside Ryan’s window. Of course, I could be just totally making this up in my head but it was really cool. I decided it was maybe 6pm, I remember it was like November because it was already dark outside and I’m floating above it outside his window. We’re teenagers so we don’t go to bed early. It was 6pm, it’s young and it’s not late at night. His lights were on in his room and he was asleep on top of his bed. He had taken a nap. I floated inside and I could smell his big citronella plant in his room and I can smell it. I liked it. He liked it. I can actually smell citronella and I floated right up over him and checked out the scene. His lights were on I could see everything in his room and then I came back and so now I called him. I came back to my body. I called him. I woke him up and I said, “Were you just sleeping?” And he’s like, “How did you know?” Sure enough. That was my verification for, “Dang. You can really astral travel can’t you?” \xa0 [01:46:21] Eric Thorton:\xa0 With the aura field giving you feedback. Giving your brain a feedback. \xa0 [01:46:27] Ashley James:\xa0Well, it’s not like I went and where it’s my aura expanded and totally – \xa0 [01:46:29] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes, your physical body didn’t go there. \xa0 [01:46:31] Ashley James:\xa0 Oh, no. Of course, I stayed in the bedroom. It’s not like anything left my body. It didn’t? \xa0 [01:46:38] Eric Thorton:\xa0 No, it didn’t. Only a part of the astral part of the aura field that has the ability to project. That does leave the body. \xa0 [01:46:47] Ashley James:\xa0So it didn’t just expand? \xa0 [01:46:48] Eric Thorton:\xa0 No, this is a specific narrow projection. And it’s connected back to you because of frequency. It’s like an emperor penguin baby can always find it’s mom even though they all look the same because it’s a frequency thing. They call it the golden quarter [Inaudible 01:47:05] It’s the frequency. It’s like there you go. You are projecting part of you and people can see your combination of your all your past lives. When people see your astral body, they’re seeing what you brought to. Your history to this body. This is why we reflect some of our genes from our family but we reflect more of past life. \xa0 [01:47:41] Ashley James:\xa0 That’s how, like my husband is 6 foot 7 and his father’s 6 foot 6 and every single person in the family is barely 5’10. Every person is made of 6 feet tall. It’s just really interesting that they’re, the entire family is all of the average height and this two giants and we don’t know where it came from. \xa0 [01:48:11] Eric Thorton:\xa0 When I was a kid, the doctor predicted the height of each of my brothers and myself. My brothers, he was right on. He said I was going to be 6 foot 2 and I went “Yes.” but my darn past life I’ve never been over 5 foot 7. So I ended up being 5 foot 6 and a half. [Laughter] And he was right on with everybody else’s but me being the major man at the joints at some point, femur like that and he was perfectly right on but no, my past lives, I have so many past lives and he was out real tall throughout history and I’m still not really tall. I was like, “Come on. Let’s go for three more reaches in the next life. Maybe four.” \xa0 [01:48:57] Ashley James:\xa0You’ve got to stretch you out in the inversion table. \xa0 [01:49:01] Eric Thorton:\xa0 But the information from past life told my body that’s how tall you’re supposed to be and we even look similar to what we have in our past life. That’s one of the reasons why we develop according to how much our history was in past life. That’s why oftentimes people like myself, I’m a little chubby I have to deal with past life when I was chubby in order to deal with the current life chubby so I have to stop gaining weight. So you have to deal with that stuff this subtle information that comes forward you have to deal with that in the aura field to get health optimal health in this life and that’s the inner and outer shakras. The astral body I can say is a very narrow section of the current aura field of the very narrow section fo the body’s aura field. It is not the soul’s aura field that projects. It’s the body’s. The soul does the etheric. The body does the astral. \xa0 [01:50:14] Ashley James:\xa0Astral is like travelling around [Crosstalk] what’s around the earth in time. \xa0 [01:50:23] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Correct. My mother wanted to actually I might have told the story before but I’m not really sure. She couldn’t light the fireplace she had a free standing stove. And her husband was asleep at that time didn’t want to wake him up, wouldn’t take chill at the house it’s winter time. She wanted to start this fire place or this free standing stove so she called me up and she goes, “Eric, how do you this?” it was a really crappy stove. She’s gotten rid of it since but they had it forever. It had to be a certain way for it to light. Very specific. I’ve never seen anything like it. I astral projected to see what she had done. \xa0 [01:51:10] Ashley James:\xa0While on the phone? \xa0 [01:51:11] Eric Thorton:\xa0 While on the phone with her. I’m standing in front of her stove in the astral body. \xa0 [01:51:16] Ashley James:\xa0She can’t see you? \xa0 [01:51:17] Eric Thorton:\xa0 She can’t see me. But remember it’s of the physical body so there’s texture to it. I’m standing there in front of the stove and I go, “Well, you stack the wood this way and you got the paper this way and it won’t do it.” I said, “And the vents aren’t right.” So I said, “Turn the vent up this way and turn the stack the end of this way and turn the lower vents open in this way.” and I said, “You need to be quiet because your husband’s behind you sleeping in the chair.” She’s asked, “How the heck do you know that?” and I go, “Well, I’m standing next to you.” And she goes, “Really?” I said, yes. Now my mom’s short you’ve got remember this is physicalness, right? Dumb me. I said, “Take your left arm.” because I was next to her left side. I said, “Walk the elbow against your body.” and I said, “Swing your arm out.” Well, she hit me in the nuts. And I go, “Ugh.” she hit my body. nope. she’s short, she hit my nuts and I went, “Ugh, got stomach ache.” and she was, “Well, it’s warm there.” I’m like, “Yes.” [Laughter] “That’s me. Can you move your hands?” she couldn’t tell where it was. Thank God because it would scar her for life but it was like, “Okay. Move that arm please.” If it weren’t for the etheric, I wouldn’t got that because it’s purely soul. \xa0 [01:53:08] Ashley James:\xa0The astral you can feel things? \xa0 [01:53:12] Eric Thorton:\xa0 You can feel things, you can smell things, you can touch things. People can see you. They can feel you because it’s actually physical energy. \xa0 [01:53:21] Ashley James:\xa0Not all people can see you but people who? \xa0 [01:53:24] Eric Thorton:\xa0 In the right light, anybody can see you just like seeing your aura field. Which is a good subject segway into teaching people how to see the aura field. \xa0 [01:53:34] Ashley James:\xa0We should totally do that. To clarify, so the astral bodies that you have just mentioned, the etheric soul part of our energy field you mentioned time travel not because with that part of your body like you said, clear across the universe in seconds but you could also time travel. Is that how we do past life regression? \xa0 [01:54:05] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes. Very good observation. One day, science is going to prove this. \xa0 [01:54:12] Ashley James:\xa0And we’re not time traveling like to go change the past but – \xa0 [01:54:17] Eric Thorton:\xa0 No, but you can. Very dangerous. \xa0 [01:54:21] Ashley James:\xa0Like you can’t stop the holocaust? \xa0 [01:54:23] Eric Thorton:\xa0 No. You could. \xa0 [01:54:23] Ashley James:\xa0Really? \xa0 [01:54:24] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes. But then you really should have the first and middle name being God, otherwise, you’re going to create karma. So masters, born masters not someone who’s trying to achieve it have the ability to change what humans call time. \xa0 [01:54:48] Ashley James:\xa0I do a technique called timeline therapy which people even people who don’t believe in past lives because it’s fun when we do it like, “What am I seeing?” because they’re seeing their past life. We go back to the root cause the first event of their, for example their let’s say they have anger that’s unresolved. Unconscious, unresolved anger from their past that is affecting them and now we go back to the root cause we call it the Gestalt, meaning gestalt is in German is that the chain of all of the events of anger that are unresolved they’re chained together like lights on a Christmas tree. We go back to the first one and they – \xa0 [01:55:29] Eric Thorton:\xa0 They are actually not going to the first one. You’re going to the first one available. \xa0 [01:55:33] Ashley James:\xa0The first one that’s unresolved that is – \xa0 [01:55:37] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Actually, it’s resolved. This is where that therapy gets a little mixed up. And it’s better if you use the right words. You’re going back where all layers. We’re going back to the next one that’s up that you can see. From that statement this is the root cause. You’re actually making a statement the next one you’re seeing you’ve got to get rid of that to get to the next one. You get improvement each time so it’s very legitimate work but you’re going back to the next one that’s available and you don’t see the other so again you think that’s the one and only. It’s not. \xa0 [01:56:17] Ashley James:\xa0It likes to do that. The clients likes to do that. There’s a way to guide the person because it helps people by saying first to get when I was five. Okay, well – \xa0 [01:56:27] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. You can guide the person to what is up. You can’t get rid of something before a person has done the homework. It will not be up for them. So the person angry as in your example. Maybe they’ve gone to therapist, maybe they’ve gone and they studied it they looked at it. Well then maybe when they really get there. If someone who’s hadn’t done it you can make the next same statement and try to go, “You’re not going to get there.” because they haven’t done the homework otherwise it would cause karma. \xa0 [01:56:56] Ashley James:\xa0So the one that’s ready to come up. We call the first event. The first event that’s ready to come up. Okay. \xa0 [01:57:04] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Hopefully it’s the root one because they’ve done their work. And it can be. \xa0 [01:57:09] Ashley James:\xa0 Yes. We do more work if there’s got issues. When we get to the one that’s the oldest one it’s getting fine. When we get to the oldest one it could be five lifetimes ago, it can also be passed genealogically. So generations ago. And so with five lifetimes ago for example and these oftentimes people don’t believe in past life so I just say, “Let’s go with it.” it’s the unconscious mind’s presenting what it presents but they gain the positive learnings and will be able to release and then get emotions and then come back to now will releasing negative emotions and gain the positive learnings. Gaining that new perspective all the way back to now. Then we work on something in this lifetime. Let’s say, something maybe a divorce that’s still being angry and they feel betrayed whatever at something that happened 15 years ago and every time they think about that time in their life, it’s always there for them. We go back. We do timeline therapy on that event and gaining a new perspective and getting the positive learnings all of a sudden when the anger’s resolved it is as if we do time travel for that person because now they’re perspective has changed so much that the memories changed. That they now see things they don’t remember were even there because it was clouded and so it’s kind of like time travel in a sense because you can have a totally different relationship with your past when you resolve things from there. \xa0 [01:58:48] Eric Thorton:\xa0 It is the reason why I said something a few minutes ago was because if – this is a new age peeve with me. We’ll make statements that give the new age a bad rep. Like saying we’re going to the root only and where it’s actually the next thing makes a person. Okay, they feel better for a while and then it shows up again and oh, it didn’t work but it did work but the words were used that made them think they were at the root it came back tell you the person was no good or the new age system didn’t work or it makes them doubt themselves and feel unworthy. Where If you just [crosstalk] it creates all the work exactly. Where if you say, “Okay, we’re going to the next thing’s that’s up. If you’ve done all your homework, this is the last thing on that.” if it hasn’t [crosstalk] if there’s the oldest event [crosstalk] that the homework is allowing. Then it doesn’t give the new age a bad reputation or the practitioner. That’s where I find semantics are so important to not make these blank across statements. \xa0 [02:00:09]Ashley James:\xa0That we’ll do mass generalizations. That’s also where we – \xa0 [02:00:12] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Oh, we do. And it totally guess something’s up with religion too. We make these thing and we make this up as we go instead of going, okay well, if you’re a healer in some way, and you keep coming up against the same thing with the same person and you keep making this mass statements you’ve lost this person from spirituality. Where it don’t make the mass statements. Let’s say we are \xa0– \xa0 [02:00:42] Ashley James:\xa0It’s because we’re meaning making machines. We go, “Oh, this means that, this was be – \xa0 [02:00:47] Eric Thorton:\xa0 We’re trying to be important instead of just, “Well, this is the last thing we’re going to reach for this onion skin. Then this onion skin.” but there’s still onion skin underneath that. It’s like when they make I want to clear my karma for other people for all time. Past and future. But they just make this mass statements about getting down into clearing all the negativity for all time, for all beings, for everything else. That’s a complete ego statement of ignorance and it gives the new age a terrible reputation. We can’t get away from the fact we’re human. We have onion skins. We’ve got them coming up from past life. We’ve got them coming at us from thousand of years of not doing our energetic work and to make this mass statements just gets things back a bad name and it makes me cringe because this people have really great therapeutic abilities and they make this statements and it makes people shy away or think it’s false. So I work really big on semantics and the work we do here. I say, “Okay, this is where we’re going today.” It’s where they’re bringing us and we’ll see if there’s something behind that. It may not show up until next time, it may take two or three times being here to get to these things but it’s like your husband has bubbled up. We went in and we did this major work with him. \xa0 [02:02:13] Ashley James:\xa0He said he has worked with you twice and each time has been awesome and now, some stuff has come up. I’m glad the first person I thought of was you instead of the doctor or the psychologist or whatever. Right? It’s like I could’ve gone to twenty years for him before we came to you. Luckily, you’re the first person on my mind because I was like, “This is exactly the kind of stuff that Eric works on.” You know what, his first session was better with you. But the second sessions was even better. It was even cooler. Because you had to do the work. You said you had to do the onion layers. \xa0 [02:02:45] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. You have to get rid of the major crap first to evaluate the process. Then leaves you. Then it starts kind of in it.– so then the next time we saw we move its more subtle but more powerful energy and then it leaves the next layer. Then that’s bubbled up for him. See people you took your knowledge and he took his knowledge and project well maybe it was from you or maybe it’s from so and so or this guy or the other. It wasn’t it was from his history. It wasn’t his family I know it’s not his family. We’ll find out what it is. \xa0 [02:03:27] Ashley James:\xa0I’m really excited. I can’t wait. \xa0 [02:03:28] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes. It’ll be fun to do that because then all of a sudden it’ll change. He hasn’t have this symptoms for very long. So subtle it’ll shift rather quickly. \xa0 [02:03:41] Ashley James:\xa0Then once he’s done, I’ll share more details. \xa0 [02:03:44] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. You have to get Duffy’s permission too. I looked in his aura field. He asked me to look to see if he needed to come in. I was like “oh, nope that’s up.” Yes, he does and we’ll find out exactly what it is and I tell people the first session is a large over all dump over the wheelbarrow crap. The next sessions is examining why do you have the wheelbarrow and you’re holding on to everything. \xa0 [02:04:15] Ashley James:\xa0You talked about that a lot in our first interview. \xa0 [02:04:18] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Exactly. So we’re doing that with him. Let’s see, it’s fun because I get to see and they get to see the changes. \xa0 [02:04:29] Ashley James:\xa0Returning to the aura, are there any other layers of it that we haven’t covered? \xa0 [02:04:35] Eric Thorton:\xa0 There’s thousands of layers. \xa0 [02:04:36] Ashley James:\xa0Really? \xa0 [02:04:37] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Oh, yes. You can talk about aura field forever. We talked about some major sections of it that needs to be brought up to the light of day and people need to start looking for that. If they start using the actually language and they’re gifted, their guides will find out what it means and I’ll help them use those parts as well. I can talk about these stories forever but one of the things that’s really interesting that we already talked about a little bit was the biases that we all have. There’s a locally there is a group of Naturopaths that work on some very specific disease. I’m not going to name the disease because if people figure out it’ll blew the place. They do a lot of muscle testing, which is very valid if you’re not biased and you’re doing all your homework. One of the doctors I decided to see what all its all about this is when it’s – \xa0 [02:05:48] Ashley James:\xa0I know exactly what you’re talking about. \xa0 [02:05:50] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. I have one of the doctors work at me at their home. She brought some of the tools that they use for testing at the clinic and she brought home. I see energy, right? One of these is an amplifier. When you do muscle testing it makes it more apparent. I’m looking at that and she’s grabbing the amplifier starts testing me and I go, “Hold on.“ and she goes, “What?” I said, “Your amplifier has been in the room with people with all these diseases it’s on the amplifier. It’s going to show up in your testing in your aura field and you’re going to diagnose me the same way as you did all your other patients.” I said, “Because that disease is now in my aura field because you literally brought it to me so that I’m going to test positive for these disease when it has nothing to do with my body whatsoever. Every single one of the tools you use between patients needs to be put in deionized water. Literally well, released to the atmosphere the dead cells from the previous person you tested.” She looked at me. Now, she already done a bunch of testing on me. I said, “Go wash those.” She went to wash them came back and the testing was completely different. Aura field. It’s this is, if people don’t acknowledge this subtleties the testing is invalid. This is where your own testing for yourself gets invalid too. People strength test for themselves and I do it too. But we’re already biased. We already have the energy of whatever we’re testing of in our brain and in our energy field so you’re going to get and different result then if you take the same information and have someone else put it on a list that you have no idea what it is. \xa0Let’s say you have choice. Five different diseases you think you might have. You just write them down and you tell the person mixed them up and label them. One, two, three and four or one, two, three, four, five, and six. Six one of them in any order will be none of these. If it picks six, see because you don’t know. You think strength test, is it one, is it two, is it three, is it four, is it five, is it six? I see mine lose at six, it was none of them. I can’t hold that. It was six. It was none of these where the others I’m asking if I have those disease so you are strong if you do. If you don’t it’ll be weak. I got that backwards. It’ll be weak if you have it. It’ll be strong if you don’t have it. When I got to none of the above it was weak, don’t have it. I didn’t know the order so I’m innocent. There’s no bias. If your friend does it for you. Whenever you’re doing strength testing you really should have a friend do it for you and mix up your choices that makes it much more valid and clean it. Clean anything everything you can. That’s one way of cleaning up your subconscious mind by not having no attachment to the things you’re testing for. That’s how you clean up your brain. Clean up the bias. You have no bias to a list that you don’t know to the order of it. It will give you then better information. This is again, your aura field with knowledge or biases. You remove it the aura field is pure again and innocent and you get more accurate information. Anyway, in this process we have to learn to clean our aura field. This is also part of seeing auras. \xa0 [02:10:07] Ashley James:\xa0Oh, I wanted to say something about that. When I was 15, I read the book The Celestine Prophecy. \xa0 [02:10:15] Eric Thorton:\xa0 I’ve heard of it. Haven’t read it. \xa0 [02:10:17] Ashley James:\xa0In the book, The Celestine Prophecy they talk about learning how to see energy. They talk about energy exchange and how when we’re in flow with each other, my energy flowing to you your energy is flowing to me. We’re a circuit. Where as one of us, let’s say couples would start getting resentful cut themselves off from a flow. That anger of resentment cuts the flow off and they get disconnected and that flusters. So we have to learn to be that circuit with each other with the flowing back and forth and they practice with plants in the book. Where they sit with plants and practice giving the plant their energy that flow back and forth. They talk about when it’s a blue sky, when the sun is either early in the morning or late in the evening so the sun’s not right in your face, put your hands up you can start to see. You can actually see the energy field between your fingers if you take your thumb and finger and pinch them together and pull them apart and you can start to see and feel it. Yes, feel it. you could see you could start to see the energy coming of your body like almost like the layer of heat off of the pavement. When I was 15 – \xa0 [02:11:43] Eric Thorton:\xa0 That’s a hard one to see though. I have an easier way. Okay so again, time of day is a big deal. Dusk. It’s still light out but no bright sun. You need a mirror. Maybe the bathroom if you’ve got some light coming in from an angle not behind you. Light coming in from an angle so the light will come in reflect bounce off your body, reflect into the mirror that’s subtle. So it’s low light but – \xa0 [02:12:16] Ashley James:\xa0So you didn’t have the lights on in the bathroom? \xa0 [02:12:18] Eric Thorton:\xa0 No. You just want something that’s coming in through a window and you move the mirror so you get an angle that’s not directed behind you straight into the mirror. You wanted an angle of to your left or of to your right. Then you sit in there in still in the room, you’ve got the light coming in you squint your eyes and you reduce the amount of information by squinting your eyes that the brain is taking in. Your brain takes in all sorts of information for balance, for safety etc. Takes in by saying that this room is pink or that is room is white or how what it’s doing to the aura field and things like that but when you squint your eyes down you’re reducing the amount information that’s coming in and your brain has to start looking at the subtle energies. Literally, you squint your eyes like this and your start seeing the energy around somewhere. Think of all different kinds of colors. It’s not just a little wave or something. It’s actually you start seeing the colors of the aura field. Takes a little practice to let your brain actually acknowledge this thing this feeling because what you’re doing is you’re reducing that light and sound input so your digestive brain starts feeding your main brain. Then that’s when you start seeing all those little colors of the aura field. It took me well, didn’t take it, I’ve seen colors my whole life but that technique took me a time or two to do it. Takes other people maybe 10 or 15 times to start seeing that but you literally go in there one day and you know inadvertently, you go into the room and the lightings that way and you look into the mirror and it’s just all color. You don’t see you at all. Your body. You see all color in there. I used to go, “huh?” and then you look at it again and all of a sudden, your eyes open so this brain starts to work and you started seeing your body in the mirror again. But if you can maintain that where your digestive brain is taking in the material squinting the eyes down you’ll start to see those colors and it’s fascinating. People go, “Wow. I really see that.” And I go, “Okay. So that’s the part that astral travels. That’s the part that we use to project around the planet.” \xa0 [02:14:39] Ashley James:\xa0If someone’s astral travelling, let’s say I was sitting here eyes closed astral traveling and you looked at me, you wouldn’t see my aura because it’s gone somewhere? \xa0 [02:14:48] Eric Thorton:\xa0 I wouldn’t see that part of the aura. Sorry, what am I saying. Part, that’s the part that you can astral travel with I just wouldn’t see that part I would see other parts of it but not that real surface part that people begin to see when they first seeing auras. That part of the aura is what picks up on all the things we are talking about. Early warning system and things like that. That is part of the homeostasis. Homeostasic part. And that’s the part that can project out. It helps if you can see it first and then which then you can see the aura and then you can start taking in information from it. You leave your eyes squinted and just listen. It’s amazing what you find. You may see a mouse in the shed. Listen with your eyes and all of a sudden you see this, because there’s so much information there. I naturally do this dance in the work I do. In and out of the body all the time constantly. Now as far as cleaning the aura field. That’s very important because the longer something’s in the aura field the more your frequencies changes to it. We’ve talked about that several times in different ways. If you have anger in your aura field, you’re going to gravitate to it. You can be if its’ there long enough you become the angry person but if you have anger in the aura field and you know you have anger in the aura field from someone else or from your own day, you don’t want to own it, we do this thing, I do this thing called flushing. \xa0I use descriptive words in my exercise rather than mystical words. Because mystical is ego based thing that says I can’t reach it. but you have to be special to get to the mystical. We’re all mystical. I use the word flushing like flushing the toilet. You press the button and out goes the poop. Well, what a better place to do that than in the shower. You sit in there in the shower, what do you got running? You got water running down over your body giving you the flush and you sit there and you open up your energy field from above your head and you let the other frequencies of the other shakras above you come through, we come that from spirit. We let that flow down through our body like the flushing water out our feet and out goes with it. Everything that is not your frequency. The anger from other people. But if you’re mad about something from someone being angry at you for two or three weeks we need to find out why but if you’re going in with somebody, the person you flush that right out, your defense system is there, there’s no processing, listen to the occasion and out goes their anger completely out of your aura field. You don’t own it yet. \xa0 [02:18:12] Ashley James:\xa0Can you walk us with the steps? \xa0 [02:18:14] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Okay, yes. I will be working with someone and each day I do the flushing after each client and – \xa0 [02:18:21] Ashley James:\xa0You take a shower after a client? \xa0 [02:18:22] Eric Thorton:\xa0 No, you don’t have to shower. That’s just a good symbol for it. When you’re learning to do it, it’s really nice because you’ve got that flow and it really helps you do it and feel it in your body. But I’ll be sitting there. I’ll be sitting or standing. I don’t want their – maybe I felt their gallbladder or something during the session and my gallbladder doesn’t need to have that information. So I’ll just sit there and flush unless it comes to the gallbladder and out it goes. Out goes their energy. You can visualize this if you want you might want to see their energy as a different color than yours and out goes maybe this blob of brown at your feet. Literally, it is that simple. There isn’t, it is opening the intention and the energy you need 10 thousands of a second, it came to you in 10 thousands of a second. All you’ve got to do it is open the intention and out it will go. It’s showing your spiritual advancement because you know to do that. You’re preserving your body, you’re saying, “Hey, this gallbladder isn’t yours, so let’s get rid of it.” and out it goes. I like to think of I like physicality and I’m a Taurus. Very grounded. I like definitely water going down my body. It doesn’t have to be, it can be clouds, it can be stars, it can be anything. Just the effort of saying, “I’ve got stuff that’s not mine in my system from this person or this situation.” it is always situational with flushing, I was like “I don’t need that.” I just came from the movie it was very intense. All the information that came from the movie screen that I can see. It’s like going to a Rambo movie you come out and you go, ”Oh, yeah.” Its like great, it was great entertainment but you don’t need to go beat someone up because the Rambo movie got you all heat up. This is a way of just getting rid of that energy you’d be surprised how fast you come down. \xa0 [02:20:26] Ashley James:\xa0You open up the intention you said the shakras above you. Can you explain this? \xa0 [02:20:31] Eric Thorton:\xa0 The seven shakra is one of many that’s above your head. I’ve been showed hundreds of shakras but we use the main six in most energy work because the other follow along better. If you do something in three you’re going to get affect of the shakras above the seventh and below the first but once in a while you need to use the information from the lesser shakras. I’ve seen a 130 roughly. I don’t remember exactly but above and below combined together. I don’t know how many there are. It depends. It’s the more subtle energy centers. Technically, you can technically say each cell is a shakra. The nucleus of a cell and it really is. Therefore you’ve got billions of shakras but the more they’re away the farther they get away from the first seven because those are the ones that have the dynamic of both the spiritual and the physical. You get away from them, you get information from them. \xa0 [02:21:45] Ashley James:\xa0It’s like the higher self. \xa0 [02:21:46] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. You don’t want to flush someone else energy through your energy field. You want to flush your own connection to the divine. So it comes through your shakras otherwise you just open it up you just open it up to anyone’s energy. \xa0 [02:21:59] Ashley James:\xa0Okay, so you’re imagining all of your shakras above your head. All of this divine connection to higher self above your head and you’re imagining that energy from that is flushing down through your body and flushing it out like a shower thinking like a shower in your own divine energy. Flushing out through and just flushing out everything that’s not you out of you. Taking a bath in a shower in you. \xa0 [02:22:23] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right, because it’s not your energy. If you’re bringing your energy down a massive form of it something that’s not your energy is going to be repulsed by it. It’s going to push away from it. \xa0 [02:22:24] Ashley James:\xa0It’s totally awesome. I just did it. It feels really good. \xa0 [02:22:48] Eric Thorton:\xa0 It does. Tell me what you felt in your feet when you did that. Do it again. \xa0 [02:22:59] Ashley James:\xa0Well, I feel warm. It was more like feeling an energetic shower in my body. \xa0 [02:23:09] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right, and it comes down to your feet. How do your feet feel? Think about it for a moment. \xa0 [02:23:20] Ashley James:\xa0Maybe there’s like a little bit of like a buzzing underneath them. \xa0 [02:23:23] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Okay. Do it again. When you’re doing that, what do you feel? Do you feel the water going through your feet? \xa0 [02:23:37] Ashley James:\xa0 Oh, I feel it. Yes, yes. \xa0 [02:23:41] Eric Thorton:\xa0 That’s being grounded. \xa0 [02:23:44] Ashley James:\xa0I can totally. Yes, I can feel it. \xa0 [02:23:47] Eric Thorton:\xa0 That’s is being grounded. This is how you ground. You can literally – \xa0 [02:23:51] Ashley James:\xa0I’m wearing shoes right now. \xa0 [02:23:53] Eric Thorton:\xa0 You don’t have to wear shoes. You can wear them or not. You can be on top of the empire state building at lady liberty and do it. This is how you get your energy. Your physical energy into the planet. The planet takes away our pain and suffering and convert it to positive energy or to negative ions which is healthy for us. Negative ions is good. It’s positive energy negative ions. It’s literally when you do the flushing, you are literally grounding yourself. When you start feeling that movement in your feet it’s because you’ve come up against the earth. It’s all resistance. You feel that movement, you feel that electricity, that buzzing. You feel a weightiness. You feel kind if you have a woof. You don’t know what is. \xa0 [02:24:40] Ashley James:\xa0 That feeling that you got heavier. \xa0 [02:24:41] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. Like that feeling they got heavier. That’s the sign you’re grounded. If you do the flushing, you don’t feel that do it again. Until you do feel that. You won’t feel that weightiness and that buzzing if there’s still stuff in you. So you keep doing it again. If you don’t feel it, go out and ask a tree to help you.\xa0 All their roots are connected into the ground and if you stand on a root which you will if you stand next to\xa0 a tree, its connected with the entire root system. It will help clear that aura field. \xa0 [02:25:20] Ashley James:\xa0 I really felt it. I actually like – \xa0 [02:25:24] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Even people who are totally etheric can ground themselves with that technique. Totally, the reason why I say, totally etheric which is anyway, uses that word I’m going to explain it real quick. It means it’s not in their body a lot. \xa0 [02:25:39] Ashley James:\xa0Yes. [Inaudible 02:25:41] which I love. She writes all this books about angels. She can see them and she can see all these entities and she writes all these great books and she has a huge heart. She lives in I think Laguna Miguel or something like that and she says that she had to stop driving in LA because she’s so out of her body she’d totally crash. She’s so out of her body to constantly be in tune with all this energy and energy that her husband was a shaman who wrote that book that you found. I believe. \xa0 \xa0 [02:26:18] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Farmer? \xa0 [02:26:19] Ashley James:\xa0Yes. I’m pretty sure that’s her husband. Who wrote that the animal talk. \xa0 [02:26:24] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. The Animal spirit guides. \xa0 [02:26:25] Ashley James:\xa0Animal Spirit Guides, yes. He too has to drive her because she can’t. She’s so etheric. So out there. Aries not grounded. When she did this – \xa0 [02:26:36] Eric Thorton:\xa0 But it’s also male. \xa0 [02:26:37] Ashley James:\xa0What do you mean? \xa0 [02:26:39] Eric Thorton:\xa0 The male animal through our history has been forced to be grounded so they can feel the lion or the enemy, even if they’re an Aries, men are physically more grounded to the earth where women are less grounded to the earth, women come in to the subtle energies faster of the etheric energies faster. \xa0 [02:27:06] Ashley James:\xa0Which helps us as moms to be able to be in tune to the energy of our family. \xa0 [02:27:12] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Exactly. That is one of the reasons, I’m saying politically incorrect. It’s not me to movement thing or anything else but it’s one of the reasons men drive more is because even if we’re more grounded\xa0 even if we’re ungrounded, even if we’re all etheric and we’re out on the universe thinking, still a part of us is essentially looking for that lion. In that more tensed driving situation the female animal will go, “Ugh” sooner than the male animal. Men can do it too but and less grounded men are going to be more, “Ugh” they can’t drive in situation like that either. \xa0 [02:27:53] Ashley James:\xa0If you want to be able to grounded and drive, do this exercise. Yes. I can feel it. so if she did this exercise would she be grounded and still be able to do the work she does?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 [02:28:07] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes. \xa0 [02:28:09] Ashley James:\xa0Very cool. \xa0 [02:28:10] Eric Thorton:\xa0 She must get used to the change but she can actually do her work better so because she has a place to be around and be at peace. \xa0 [02:28:21] Ashley James:\xa0 I like it and so I’m imagining because where your intention goes your energy flows and I’m imagining this like all of the over my head and then they all open up and just dump this shower and so it takes, it’s kind of like the filing a big bucket and then empty it. It takes a few second to like from my first intention it takes few seconds and then start feeling it in my body kind of like it took a few secondss for the bucket to empty on to me and the I could feel it going down and I could feel the feeling in my feet. I feel that weighted. \xa0 [02:28:59] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Weightiness I call it. it’s like a little toss down there. \xa0 [02:29:01] Ashley James:\xa0It was. It wasn’t continual. It’s like a bucket and then the bucket was done and then you said do it again and I had to do it again just like imagine filing this bucket and then the 170 shakras above my head just went,”- and did this shower. \xa0 [02:29:21] Eric Thorton:\xa0 And pulsed out the energy that wasn’t yours. \xa0 [02:29:22] Ashley James:\xa0Like a pulse or like being dumped. \xa0 [02:29:25] Eric Thorton:\xa0 I like to do it different ways. If I’m laying there in bed, I’d do the real long slow thorough cleaning if you will. If I’m just I’ve got to clear stuff. I’d go, “Poof! In 10th of a second and then different things. If I’m clearing casual energy from clients there’s poof because everyone would vibrate with it at all. \xa0 [02:29:51] Ashley James:\xa0You can do this with objects on your house? Could you clean your whole house or clean your whole car of energy? \xa0 [02:29:58] Eric Thorton:\xa0 When you clean your energy field with both people whose name everyone’s name on the house cleans, both cleaning you are cleaning your house, your house reflect your shakras. People ask me all the time, can you clear my house? Yes, I can. Really easy. Expect you’re going to pollute it again. But if we clear you, then your house clears. Some people always asking for the house to clear because they want to divert from doing their own homework. I was like, “No. If this is clear, this house is clear.” \xa0 [02:30:33] Ashley James:\xa0What comes up for me next is as we vibrate at a higher frequency as we are clear we could become potentially become targets for something or someone that wants to – it’s like tall puppy syndrome or you see that bright shiny person over there? Let’s go kick their dog. In life, there are these people or entities or whatever situation that wants to pull us down like crab in a bucket. Now I have this clean, wonderful squeaky clean aura and I’m about to go out the in the world where someone might be pissed off that you’re just a happy person let’s rain on their parade, how do we energetically protect ourselves? \xa0 [02:31:28] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Well, that is a form of protection. \xa0 [02:31:31] Ashley James:\xa0If someone like lashes out, I know you taught us an exercise which listeners have said they absolutely love or the chi ball where you’re just boomeranging it back to them so isn’t staying on you. If you feel like eeky like energetically someone is dumped on your parade, you just do this again? \xa0 [02:31:50] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes, do it again but what it does for you is this. When someone lets say someone is going to let’s get extreme here just for the sake of discussion, someone’s going to shoot at a crowd, if they feel someone with really good innocent energy. They might not shoot up the crowd. It’s not going to force them to do it, it’s going to make them hesitate because you’ve got to remember the subtle even possessions are part of God. And their purpose is to drive you to God. The purpose is to make you agitated so much that you search and you ultimately have to search for God. You have someone like me in a crowd and you have someone or you in a crowd, someone wants to shoot up a crowd. I was just going to stand out a bit and they’re going to be going, “Oh, maybe this isn’t the right crowd.” It doesn’t pull them to it even if it’s possessions because possession’s idea is to get you to God. \xa0 [02:33:03] Ashley James:\xa0 If this yes, all right. I get it now. When you said this helps us protect us because I had this idea that maybe being having an innocent energy or having a higher frequency clean energy would attract people to wanted to harm it. \xa0 [02:33:20] Eric Thorton:\xa0 It attracts innocence. \xa0 [02:33:23]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0It sees the opposite. \xa0 [02:33:24] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. It’s like a baby. The baby’s energy is clear. We all go, “Aww, isn’t that nice.” We don’t know why because they’re innocent. When someone with lack of innocence looks at people with innocence, they’re attracted to it. They don’t want to kill it. It actually does more to protect you, than it does to harm you. \xa0 [02:33:51] Ashley James:\xa0Should someone do this every day when they get home, like once a day? \xa0 [02:33:56] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Definitely. Yes. If you’re having a rough day at work, do it throughout the day. If you’re having just casual stuff after you give the energy back to the person then you want to flush the energy out because you don’t need the negative connotations that came up because someone’s in a bad mod from your own history. We create our own energy. This person’s got one negative and you start getting pissed off about instead you go, “Oh, that’s their stuff you still have the hormone, you have the reaction, you can flush that right out. Should be down early throughout the day that’s why you use the 10th\xa0of a second flush and the longer ceremonial flush. One’s very restorative and one’s just cleaning the crap out. I’ve had my reaction to their crap. That way the body stabilizes and you just don’t need them to turn your day into a bad day. It’s how you stay in the moment. So do the energy exchange with a person with the bad mood and then flush their stuff out and your reaction out to their bad mood. \xa0 [02:35:03] Ashley James:\xa0And for listeners to learn about what you just said about how to do the energy exchange you’ve got to go back and listen to the first and second interview that we did together. I’m going to make sure that all the interviews we’ve done together are linked to the show notes so that those who haven’t heard all of our episodes can do that. Listeners can also go to\xa0learntruehealth.com\xa0and search Eric Thorton in the search button to find every episodes that we’ve done together. Start at the beginning and listen to the first episode and the second episode. Just to give an understanding of this – \xa0 [02:35:40] Eric Thorton:\xa0 It was a big help. I worked for the lady yesterday that had listened to your show and she went back and listened to them all. She got my book and it saved her a lot of time in session. We got a lot deeper because she had learned about things a little bit. \xa0 [02:35:57] Ashley James:\xa0Nice. She’s probably listening right now. \xa0 [02:35:58] Eric Thorton:\xa0 She probably is. \xa0 [02:35:59] Ashley James:\xa0Say hi. \xa0 [02:36:00] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Hi! [Laughter] That’s like, she literally saved herself pain and suffering and time and cash because we finished instead of 5 or 6 hours of that first session, we finished in the actual four because she’d done a little bit of homework. Anyways, do it. Get the flushing down, do the energy exchange. It makes life way better. \xa0 [02:36:24] Ashley James:\xa0Awesome. This has been so much fun having you here, Eric. \xa0 [02:36:27] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Thanks. I love doing this too. \xa0 [02:36:30] Ashley James:\xa0 We’ve got a whole line up of topics that you’ve come up with. We’ve got a bunch more that we’re going to do together. This is great. Listeners go to\xa0ericthorton.com \xa0 [02:36:41] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Yes. Eric with a C and no middle N on the Thorton. \xa0 [02:36:44] Ashley James:\xa0 Yes, Eric Thorton. \xa0 [02:36:49] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Right. Because there is a Thornton too. He gets a lot of crazy emails. [Laughter] “I sent you the email.” “Well, I don’t have it. Look at your address, is there a middle N there?” “Yes.” “Okay, well this guy in Alabama just got your email.” They’re going, “Oh, no.” “Don’t worry. He thinks we’re nuts.” Be sure to either copy and paste it or be sure there’s no middle N. \xa0 [02:37:18] Ashley James:\xa0Eric Thorton and of course, to everything that Eric does is going to be at the show notes of today’s podcast at the\xa0learntruehealth.com. Eric, is there anything left unsaid covering auras? Anything, oh of course I know you could talk for days about that. In the context of this conversation helping people to fully utilize it. We taught them today. Is there anything left to wrap up today’s interview? \xa0 [02:37:43] Eric Thorton:\xa0 I can’t think of anything specific the reason is because with each person, that would be I would need to talk to each person to see what is in their specific situation that’s preventing them from doing this stuff. That is if a person’s does have a problem with it, they’re unable to achieve these things, we’re saying there’s some work to be done. \xa0 [02:38:07] Ashley James:\xa0Yes. So do the exercise and if you can’t, if you’re getting like hitting a wall, then talk to Eric. And see what’s going on in there. Absolutely. Awesome. Well, thank you so much, Eric. I can’t wait for you to come back \xa0 [02:38:19] Eric Thorton:\xa0 Thanks for having me. \xa0 [02:38:20] Ashley James:\xa0We’ll keep doing this. \xa0 [02:38:21] Eric Thorton:\xa0 This is great. We’ve got list of topics forever. \xa0 [02:38:24] Ashley James:\xa0Awesome. Thank you. \xa0 [02:38:25] Eric Thorton:\xa0 All right. Take care \xa0 Ashley James:\xa0Hello, true health seeker.

This is Episode 379. \xa0 \xa00:13 Ashley James:\xa0I am so excited for today’s guest. We have back on the show Theresa Vigarino. Theresa was in episode 88 almost two years ago. And Theresa and I have stayed connected and stayed friends since then. I loved our interview back in Episode 88. And Theresa has so much to share with us. I am really excited to hear the story. She started trying to tell me over Skype the other day and I was like, “No, no, no, I want the listeners to hear it too.” I really want to hear what’s happened. And she started just giving little tidbits of the last two years and I got so excited that I have to record this. So let’s just save it for the interview. So this is going to be new information for me too. Theresa, your life last two years has been quite amazing. Welcome back. \xa0 \xa0 1:06 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Oh, yeah. It has. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Ashley. I love being here. And I love the people that I’ve met that reached out to me two years ago through the podcast interview we did back then and you know, I have nothing but love for you and being brave. And I’m just so honored to be here because I know you have such a beautiful tribe of listeners and people that are really ready to awaken to who they really are. \xa0 1:36 Ashley James:\xa0Exactly. \xa0 \xa0 1:36 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0So I’m happy to be part of that process even just a little bit. \xa0 \xa0 1:40 Ashley James:\xa0Oh, wonderful. Awaken to who you really are. And isn’t that what it’s all about? Now you have a free giveaway for the listeners. You’re so funny, you’re like podcasters expect us to give things away. And I’m just like, isn’t your presence enough? We’re going to give something cool to the listeners. Okay, so you have a gift for the listeners. It’s free, three people. And you created it a while ago, but it’s still very relevant. And it’s a free audio course on manifesting in your life. And so the link to that is going to be in the show of today’s podcast at\xa0www.learntruehealth.com\xa0and then listeners can go to that and they sign up for your free audio course where you teach techniques for designing your life in a way that manifests the miraculous. \xa0 \xa0 2:33 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Absolutely. And I just love teaching this because so often in life we walk around feeling victim to our circumstances, when in actuality we manifest all the time. And so understanding this and that literally when you look around your life experience you are the creator of what you’re seeing around you. And that’s the beginning actually. And what I’ve learned in the past two years is there’s so much more and there’s always more to learn and grow and experience and expand and I’ve been going to school, I’ve gone to spiritual school, if you will, the last couple of years, man. Wow is all I can say. \xa0 \xa0 3:12 Ashley James:\xa0The spiritual school of hard knocks, right? \xa0 \xa0 3:15 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0A little bit, some intense growth because it was life or death for me quite frankly. And I was brought to my knees. If only I could have bent my knees, I would have been on my knees. But at the time I was turning into a stiff lady with scleroderma. And it was really a divine unfoldment although it was extremely uncomfortable. And I was extremely ill. It took me to my knees so that I could grow. \xa0 \xa0 3:44 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 3:46 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And I could really learn what healing was all about. \xa0 \xa0 3:49\xa0 Ashley James:\xa0It’s in the hardest times that we can gain the most growth. \xa0 \xa0 3:54 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes, and I’m still learning and it’s a forever deal for all of us. But what I went through in the past two years since we last spoke was basically the heroine’s journey of my life. A solo journey into the depths of my being, into the depths of what I was creating, into the depths of disease, into the depths of emotional healing, into the depths of energy and vibration, and ancient plant medicine and Shamanism. \xa0 \xa0 4:22 Ashley James:\xa0In the depths of the jungle. I can’t wait to get to that part of the story. \xa0 \xa0 4:25 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yeah, yeah, yeah. Into the depth, depth, depths of the jungle. \xa0 \xa0 4:28 Ashley James:\xa0So take us back. So after our interview you told me that you ended up falling sick, is that with scleroderma? And you ended up in the hospital? Can you tell us about that? \xa0 \xa0 4:40 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. Well, 2017. In 2016, at the end of the year, I was very, very sick. And that’s whenever I had an evening. And there were so many things that were happening, including an adrenal crisis that literally could have taken me out. Like at any point, I remember lying bed, we had just gone through the holidays. So it was January 2017. And I had just moved, I was in an area that I didn’t know anyone except my husband and he was actually out of town. I had no family around me. And I was very, very, very ill and I was lying in bed ready to call him to come home from a meeting or 911. And at the time my kidneys were shutting down. The scleroderma was so wrapped around the linings of my lungs that I was having bad EKGs. I was feeling like I couldn’t breathe. I was struggling to move my body. I was crawling to the bathroom, I’m only not being able to urinate that evening. And I mean, I just wanted to go. I was so sick, I crawled back in bed, and I will never forget this as long as I live. And I said, “God, I’m ready.” And all of a sudden, deep in this meditative space, so I was struggling both dimensions I saw the face of Yeshua, the Christ say to me, “Really? Are you sure about that?” And then immediately, like a snapshot picture of my husband’s face, a snapshot picture of my daughter’s face, then my son’s face, and then a room full of people. It was like a giant auditorium and all these people looking at me that I did not recognize. And I said, “No, of course I’m not ready. I’ll stay. I know I’m not done yet.” And so he began to show me along with some archangels that were in my room that night how to self-heal. \xa0 So at the time we knew I had a mass in my lung. We knew I was in adrenal crisis, we knew my kidneys were inflamed, we knew that I was really in bad shape. I wasn’t getting enough oxygen to my heart through the scleroderma process. And he was showing me how to self heal. And so immediately the next day, I started feeling a little bit better. What happened after that, now It took me, I wasn’t fully healed after that, and I ended up spiraling down in a different way later in the year. But what happened was, he told me to start praying for my clients. Now at the time, I was always the spiritual warrior, right? But I wasn’t always praying for people outside of my family, friends and people I was very close to. And so I started actually praying for people and they started having miraculous results; a healing of Crohn’s disease, a pain in the knee, you know, migraines, financial woes, relationship problems, it didn’t matter what the subject matter was. And I would hear him say, pray. And the prayers were always channeled. I could not not remember any of them afterwards. And so I then began to discover this part of me that I had been told that I was resistant into allowing to unfold in my life, because of the ego and fear of what people would think and what if it didn’t work, and all of this right? That I projected, that was amazing, miraculous, miraculous experience for me. And it was just so humbling. And after that, later in the year, I again began to plummet in my health. And so I got an invitation to go to the jungle of the Amazon to partake in the plant medicine from a friend. \xa0 \xa0 8:22 Ashley James: Okay, first, can you just take us back to that invitation? So was it kind of like out of the blue? \xa0 \xa0 8:30 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yeah. So yes, it was, and yet it wasn’t. So I have a mentor who was helping me understand maybe in a clear conscious conduit, you know, medium of sorts, spiritual teacher and accessing and amplifying these gifts and understanding it more. And she said to me, “Theresa, you really need to investigate plant medicine.” So I began a search in my area in the Bay Area, south of San Francisco, and I was looking into Shamanism and plant medicine, but I didn’t know anything about it quite frankly. I had heard of it a little bit, but really had not researched it prior to that, and didn’t know, didn’t understand it at all. So out of the blue. But you know, the universe works this way. Right? I get this blessing dropped in my lap. In November, the week before Thanksgiving, I get a call from a friend of mine who I knew from a business group, not a spiritual group, he wasn’t a client or anything just from a business coach that I was involved with for a while. And I met him at an event and we became friends and out of the blue, hadn’t spoken to him in a year. He calls me up and he says, “Theresa, I am running a retreat to the depths of the jungle in Peru to the Amazon. And I have an opening that just came available. We leave in two days and for some reason I just know you’re supposed to be there.” Now this guy had no idea of my physical struggles. I just wasn’t talking about it with everybody all the time, working on rewriting my story. And I was just about fell out of my chair. He said, “Just buy your ticket. Meet me in Iquitos. This is when you need to meet me.” And it was in two days. \xa0 \xa0 10:15 Ashley James:\xa0In Peru. Iquitos, Peru. \xa0 \xa0 10:17 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0In Peru. Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 10:18 Ashley James:\xa0So fly from San Francisco to Peru in two days and you’ve been like on your deathbed twice in the last year. \xa0 \xa0 10:26 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. And actually just days before that, had been back to the hospital for heart pain, chronic heart pain that wasn’t going away and I did have a bad EKG and they didn’t really know what was causing it and so I was really not feeling well and I actually was on lockdown with my connective tissues, so I wasn’t able to move my joints very easily. And so I was really struggling, Ashley, and I was in a lot of pain and I didn’t understand what was happening actually. \xa0 \xa0 10:57 Ashley James:\xa0So scleroderma which you’ve had over a long time… \xa0 \xa0 11:02 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Since I was four, yeah. \xa0 \xa0 11:03 Ashley James:\xa0Is that an autoimmune condition of the connective tissue? \xa0 \xa0 11:06 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0It is and so the way they describe it is autoimmune vascular because it’s also in the blood vessels, arthritic, because a soft tissue arthritis, inflammatory because it inflames organs. \xa0 \xa0 11:24 Ashley James:\xa0So, everything but bones? \xa0 \xa0 11:26 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Everything but bones and lipid. \xa0 \xa0 11:28 Ashley James:\xa0Wow. Okay, so yeah, so you’re in rough shape, but you gotta get to Peru two days to go into the jungle. \xa0 \xa0 11:34 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. And I got off the phone with him. And I said to Victor, my husband, I was like, “Babe, you aren’t gonna believe this.” But now we don’t say this to each other. “You’re not gonna believe this.” Because we believe just about anything after everything we’ve gone through. We are not surprised by surprises. You know, and he didn’t know this person at the time. And I said, “Jimmy invited me to go, he’s the guy from this event. And we became friends, invited me to go with him to do plant medicine.” And he was like, “Well, you gotta go. You gotta go.” \xa0 \xa0 12:06 Ashley James:\xa0I love your husband. I’ve never met him, but I love him. Just the fact he was supportive. How many spouses would be like, “No, you’re too sick. What do you mean? You’re not going to the jungle, with a complete strange man I’ve never met.” Like, oh my gosh. And he’s like, “Go, you have to. It’s your journey.” I just love him. \xa0 \xa0 12:24 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0He is so amazing. And he’s also been to the jungle three times, and we’ll go into that. \xa0 \xa0 12:28 Ashley James:\xa0Not before this point and after this point. So he had never been to the jungle. He didn’t know Jimmy. He knows that you’re struggling physically. But he said go. So okay, so there you go. So two days later, you’ve managed to figure out your life and get to Peru, then what happened. \xa0 \xa0 12:46\xa0 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0So we meet at the airport and we begin our journey into the jungle. So Iquitos is you fly to Lima, we met in Lima. And then we take the two and a half hour flight, there’s the only way to Iquitos is by boat or airplane. You’re really locked in the jungle there and it’s on the river. And so it’s really the gateway to Shamanism, because even if you decide to go into Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, it’s up in that corridor where those countries all kind of meet, and it is the gateway to traditional plant medicine. So yeah, I land in Lima, we meet with our group, I think we were a group of like 11 of us and we take the smaller plane over the mountains and into the jungle. And then we take about a two hour bus ride, and an hour boat ride to this oasis of beauty because this woman that owns this lodge for plant medicine, and so she also has people that just want to come and experience the jungle. But mostly it’s a healing retreat center. And it is absolutely, well, it’s my second home now, one of the most beautiful places you can imagine. And you know, even though it’s beautifully appointed, you’re still in the jungle, so there’s a lot of jungle that goes with it that you have to acclimate to, and that a lot of people are fearful of and you face those fears, because you’re there. \xa0 \xa0 14:11 Ashley James:\xa0Right. Like spiders. \xa0 \xa0 14:15 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Like spiders. Like everything and, and you know, my husband and I adventurous as we are, we really got into that show Naked and Afraid. And the ones that always tapped out were the ones that were in the Amazon. So I did have a little bit of fear. I’ll be honest, you know, it was a little scary for me of the critters. And now I know they’re just my friends coming to say hi. \xa0 \xa0 14:40 Ashley James:\xa0Oh my gosh. \xa0 \xa0 14:41 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0I love more than others like the butterflies and dragonflies and the birds, you know, and the lady bugs but you know, there’s some that I’m like, “Okay, hi.” From afar, right? \xa0 \xa0 14:51 Ashley James:\xa0Yes. \xa0 \xa0 14:52 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yeah. So it was quite a personal growing experience into the realm of other life forms, because there are more different types of life forms in the Amazon jungle than anywhere on Earth. \xa0 \xa0 15:06 Ashley James:\xa0Oh, I bet and it’s such a shame that they’ve been burning parts of it down. And I mean, it just breaks my heart. But this idea of getting out of your comfort zone, just, I mean, step one, right? You took a leap of faith. Step two, you’re out of your comfort zone, because you’re surrounded by animals and insects. And you know, it’s a foreign language, a foreign geography, foreign weather. I mean, every everything is foreign. \xa0 \xa0 15:37 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And foreign medicine. \xa0 \xa0 15:38 Ashley James:\xa0Sure. So everything’s different. You’re really thrown out of your comfort zone, which I think is also can be very cathartic to break out of old patterns. So tell us about your first experience there. How long did you stay? Walk us through it. \xa0 \xa0 15:55 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yeah, so I was there for 10 days. And in those 10 days we were led through some group workshops with my friend and he was explaining what we were embarking upon, because most of us that were there had never experienced plant medicine and in particular, Ayahuasca. So I knew nothing about Ayahuasca, other than it was some some kind of medicine that the shamans drink with you. And then they sing the songs. That’s all I knew. And I did not have time to investigate or research and thank God I didn’t because I literally was going in blind. And you know, at this point, ignorance was bliss for me. And so I just did what I was told to do. And we began our journey. I think we got to the lodge in the evening. And so the plant medicine started the next morning with a prerogative. So we got up early in the morning, we rallied in the grass around each other, we had to drink this green, this one glass of this green drink that tasted like lemongrass, actually. And then we had to drink like a gallon of water, just glasses, glasses and glasses of water, which caused a purging. So in traditional plant medicine, you do go through a purging process of the body, which we purge in only so many ways, you know, vomiting, sneezing, blowing your nose, you know, evacuation through urination, defecation, sweating, some people sneeze, cough, laugh, you know, there’s lots of ways emotionally that we purge. But you do begin with the physical body. And what I’ve learned is, the medicine works better when you’re cleaner physically. So since we live in a toxic environment, you do go through some of that. So we did do this. It’s called Vomativo. We drank the prerogative, we did the Vomitivo. And actually, you feel clean afterwards. Then that evening, we began our journey into the visionary for some, but the deeper work of Ayahuasca, which they call the grandmother of all medicine, like all medicine. And that is a journey, that is the heroine and the hero’s journey. And, you know, so I went through that experience six times in those 10 days, and also another plant medicine called San Pedro. And so we can talk if you’d like to about what the ceremony is like, and what you go through. \xa0 \xa0 18:16 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, please. Yeah, I saw a documentary think it’s still in Netflix about Ayahuasca and how they’re using Or people go into the jungle and do this, who’ve come back for more time who have post traumatic stress. And they, oh my gosh, so many of them end up healing and resolving an it’s like completing. They’re complete with the post traumatic stress, and they go back, you know, I mean, sometimes they visit the jungle a few more times, but they can reenter society, and they don’t have those wounds, those scars, those triggers from the war time. So there’s a lot of benefits that they’re seeing. \xa0 \xa0 19:00 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Absolutely. \xa0 \xa0 19:00 Ashley James:\xa0And obviously, it’s a medicine that has been practiced for a very long time. This isn’t like, you know, some trippy street drug. I mean, this is very responsible and the shamans are leading it. \xa0 \xa0 19:11 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And it’s very respected in South America. You know, I just read an article last year about how in Brazil, they’re using this plant medicine to rehabilitate hardened criminals, the worst of the worst. So there is so much about this medicine that science is now researching. There’s so many researchers were there, you know, people are drinking the medicine and they’re scanning brains while on the medicine and seeing how it activates parts of the brain. It is really helping people with chronic depression and mental illness. For me, I was the only person that was really there for physical illness, that first time. And so what happened to me was really intense. And they said it would be after a few rounds of it, that for someone who was as sick as I was in the physical realm, that I was going to go through a lot. And so they have in the ceremony, the ceremonies are always in the evening, at night in the dark and you’re in a special ceremony room that’s blessed and the shamans are there. And they make this brew and the tea they call it, is a mix of traditionally, and it’s important I want to reiterate, you want to know who your shamans are. And you want to know how they’re making the medicine. There are shamans in America that are distributing this medicine and there are a lot of reputable people. I personally have had several shamans now because I’ve been down there several times and I have found my shamans and I will only work with them. Because this medicine also works on the energy of the individual, their personal energy matters as well. Their lives matter as well because they’re part of your healing process. And so the first two times that I went down there, so I’ve been four times. The first two times I went was different shamans, this last two times and most recently, I spent the month of June, this year, so just two months ago with a mother and a son. They work together and mother son shaman and I won’t go to anybody else. They are who I will work with. They are who helped transform me, the others – the medicine worked great, but they just didn’t have the healing gifts that these other shamans have. So that’s why I found my shamans, right? So anyways, so back to the original time that I went there. So we get ready, we stop eating at 2pm. And we go into ceremony in about 7pm. And in the jungle, it literally gets dark by seven. I don’t care what time of the year, I’ve been there all times of year now it’s dark by seven. So we’re dressed in white typically. And we head off into what’s called a Maloca. And it is a sacred ceremony space. It’s a round room and you see them all over the jungle with a pitch thatch roof. And you know it’s nicely appointed. There’s restrooms outside, bathroom number one they call is mama bears bathroom. That’s me. Because I’m the one that spent some time in the restroom. It’s laughable. They’re like, “Oh, she’s in there again. Put her baby wipes in there.” So yes, I spent a lot of time purging that way and it was unbelievable what came out of my body. Old infections and I won’t go into more detail about that. \xa0 \xa0 22:35 Ashley James:\xa0Oh, my gosh. I’m so curious. Did you see parasites? \xa0 \xa0 22:40 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Oh my gosh, okay. \xa0 \xa0 22:43 Ashley James:\xa0Okay listeners who’ve been listeners for a while are laughing probably because I’m so obsessed. I want to know, I want to know the details. Give me the details. Parasites, did you see the parasites? \xa0 \xa0 22:57 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0This is how I saw the parasites. So the first two nights, what would happen is my belly would just blow up like a balloon. So I’ll go back into the detail of how the ceremony plays out. So we’re sitting on these mats, everybody has a bowl and some toilet paper or napkins, you know, because some people do purge through vomiting. And I have, but not as much as the other way. What we’ve discovered is I’m extremely sensitive to the medicine. So I need the least amount. The original shamans were giving me full doses. And it was too much, quite frankly, for me. And I was oh boy, the first two nights. I didn’t have, I saw some visions. So I’m very visionary person. And some people experience the visionary journey and some don’t. Now, Westerners like to call this a psychedelic hallucinatory experience, however, and they call it a drug. It’s a misconception. This is a very powerful strong medicine. And the reason why they call it the grandmother of all medicines is because it works on every part of your being; your mind body, your emotional body, your energetic body, your physical body, your spirit body. It’s like having the best doctor, Psychotherapist, spiritual teacher, all in the same room in one night. It’s like 20 years of therapy, a 20 years of toxins coming out of your body, 20 years of stuck emotion coming out of your body in one night. \xa0 \xa0 24:29 Ashley James:\xa0Oh my gosh. That’s so cool. \xa0 \xa0 24:31 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0That’s so powerful. \xa0 \xa0 24:31 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, when I watched the documentary, I believe someone said one of the people is going through it, said it was really, it was like you face the mirror. It’s like your soul faces the mirror of yourself and I can really see why criminals would find healing through it because they actually have to then face the actions and then feel what they did to others and face that. And so people were in denial. I mean, you can’t be in denial, you face all your stuff. Is that accurate? \xa0 \xa0 25:10 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0It’s so accurate. And I want to say, and it is in the kindest way possible. Because I saw the mistakes that I had made over my life. And the part I played even if the other party, whatever circumstance it was, just, you know, in my views and terrible things to me, or what have you, right? I also played a part in some of that. I also realized my portion of it and I grieve that part of myself. It’s also a great shame release, because the most negative vibration, it’s totally a vibratory medicine. The darkest emotional vibration, and we know that we’re all energetic beings, and that we resonate to a vibration. The one that stays the deepest stuck inside of ourselves is shame. \xa0 \xa0 26:02 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 26:04 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And so this helps bring the shame up, and you see it and you release it. So you not just have forgiveness for others, but for yourself, for the things that you’ve done. Because none of us are perfect, you know, those without and I don’t like to word, the word sin means miss the mark, you know, cast the first stone. In other words, we shouldn’t be judging each other because we’re not perfect. We’re all a work in progress. Yet, we are perfect because we have the spirit of the great creator living within us. And we’re here to emerge as that. But in the process, we have the human aspect of our life experience. And, you know, we’ve all done things that we’re not proud of, or said things or engaged in things that we wish we wouldn’t have in hindsight, right? So this helps you access those places of stuck guilt, shame, remorse, resentment, anger, guilt, all of those negative emotions, and it bubbles up to the surface and you’re able to get it out of your body. \xa0 \xa0 27:01 Ashley James:\xa0So take us back to the first night. Take us back to the ceremony and tell us what happened. \xa0 \xa0 27:06 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0First of all, it I thought it was freaky as all get out because I’m like, “What are we doing in the dark?” Because I really didn’t know what was going on. \xa0 \xa0 27:12 Ashley James:\xa0They guy didn’t explain to you everything? \xa0 \xa0 27:15 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0A little bit. But it’s still like, it’s still an experience to have to actually go do it, right? We walk in we’re like, I’m next to my roomie, this beautiful and she’s like one of the dearest souls in my life now. We became best friends, because neither one of us had experienced the jungle before and she was even more scared than me of jungle critters. And so we picked mats next to each other and talking to each other. “Hey, are you okay?” You know, it’s nice to have a little buddy your first night. So yes, we didn’t understand it. But there’s still something different about doing it. Right? We did have an explanation of what we’d experienced. But so and what happens is the shamans, there’s a light at the beginning and they’re pouring the brew and a cup and come up, set your intention. You sit before the shamans, you drink the brew, you go back to your mat, and we’re in silence at that point. They go around the room, everybody drinks it, and then they drink it and there was two shamans there, and two females and they drink the medicine and then the lights go out and they smoke a sacred tobacco called Mapacho, which Mapacho is for clearing energy. And if you notice most ancient tribes from Africa to Australia to North America, the indigenous tribal ceremonies always have smoke involved either through a fire, or they’re smoking some sacred tobacco. And because it’s a master plant, and it is a medicine, and it clears spiritual energy. Okay, because part of the ceremony is you’re opening up energetically. So it’s about your safety. So that’s why you want to know that you’re with a powerful shaman. And that we could go into the details of that later. So they begin smoking. And then you start after a while feeling the effects of the medicine and it can be different for everyone. The medicine is brewed between a vine and a leaf. The vine is called Ayahuasca and the leaf is called Chacruna. Now, there are lesser evolved, lesser enlightened people that serve medicine. And a lot of Westerners want the visionary experience and so they go for that and these shamans they just pick randomly who to work with at the airport sometimes, come to find out. And they will add a third ingredient for the hallucinatory experience and so that they have this trip, if you will. That’s not what I’m interested in. I’m interested in healing. And many people come away with it with a different experience than what is truly the medicine and traditional witches those two ingredients only \xa0 \xa0 29:52 Ashley James:\xa0Giving Ayahuasca a poor rep. \xa0 \xa0 29:54 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes, yes. So you know a reputable shaman, a reputable Lodge and you know, truly, truly if any of your listeners want to know the place that I went with the shamans, I am best friends with the lady that owns the lodge now and they are the most healing, loving, authentic, integris group of people I’ve ever worked with. They cared for me during my darkest nights of my soul. \xa0 \xa0 30:18 Ashley James:\xa0So listeners can reach you\xa0www.theresavigarino.com\xa0and get that information about the lodge and all that. So on your first night you’re lying on your mat. Now you must be hearing the sounds of the jungle outside. \xa0 \xa0 30:33 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Oh, the symphony of the jungle is unlike any other sounds you’ve ever heard. \xa0 30:39 Ashley James:\xa0It’s very loud. \xa0 \xa0 30:40 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0It’s very loud, it’s very loud and it’s very dark. Because of where we are situated there’s no electricity, they run off generators in the evenings. And by 10pm, the generators are off. And they have to boat everything into this place, right? So the generators are in the evening. So you can charge your phone, but you have very limited access to the phone, there’s no internet, no TV, you’re away from work, you’re away from everything. So because of the lack of distraction, you really get to face these parts of you that really need to be faced so that you can have freedom and liberation. And so the first couple of nights, I would see the sacred geometry, you know, in black and white and so I would see some things that affected my experience, my visionary experience. But what happened to me was my belly just blew up to where I was like eight or nine months pregnant. And I was in the pooper, I call it and I was in the bathroom just evacuating like I had never in my life. \xa0 \xa0 31:39 Ashley James:\xa0How do you get through if it’s dark? \xa0 \xa0 \xa031:42 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Oh, they have facilitators there. \xa0 \xa0 31:43 Ashley James:\xa0Do you have flashlights? \xa0 \xa0 31:45 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yeah, and you bring your own flashlight. So you have a list of things to bring for your experience; headlamp, little flashlight, and they have facilitators. So, this one his name was Alex. I call him my jungle son. I’d be like, “Alex.” And he would come and get me and escort me outside into the facilities and wait for me until I wash my hands and come back and guide me back to my mat. Because you are under the effects of the medicine. So you do feel woozyness, you definitely feel different, right? But you have full consciousness and full awareness while the medicine is working. So for me the first two days, because I went at the last minute, I did not have any. Most people that go, they have a couple weeks where they are cleaning up their diet. And even though I eat really clean, no oil, no butter, no caffeine, spices, salt, no pork, no red meat. There’s a specific diet that you eat to cleanse yourself so that you don’t have to go through as much detoxing while you’re there. So taken into account that I had just been in no medicines, right? I had been in the hospital, I had had steroids in my system till right before I came. I had IV anti inflammatories, I had a lot of things in my system that I was not cleared out of, so the medicine worked as a detox on me immediately. And boy did I feel it. By the third ceremony, my visionary experience just kicked my butt. I did not know what was happening to me. And it was extremely scary for me because I had never had that kind of experience. I am not a user of psychedelics. And I had never experienced something like this before. The colors and the patterns and the things, I mean, I just didn’t even know what was going on. So I got really afraid because we know what the brain, Ashley, if you’re having a new experience and you don’t have a frame of reference for it, it really triggers fear. And what I learned from that scary night, scariest night of my life, and I had to be in the bathroom of course and it hit me within five minutes. Usually it takes 30 minutes, sometimes an hour, sometimes people don’t. The medicines working but they don’t have that experience at all. Because I’m so open and because I’m such a visionary and I’m so spiritual and energetically connected, it was like bam! Five minutes in, okay, and I’m like, “Oh my God, what’s going on? I end up literally on the jungle ground, fear of critters, didn’t care, had my friend. My friend with me, the owner of the lodge, five facilitators, another shaman came out and I thought literally, I thought I was going to die. Now I did have a death that night. The fear of death and I didn’t realize as spiritual being as I was and knowing where I’m going afterwards, there is still the egoic attachment of the greatest fear that we walk around with that even in your mind you think you don’t have, it’s still stuck in the body. We learned at five years old, you know what I’m saying? \xa0 \xa0 34:57 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 34:58 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Even though intellectually we go, “Oh we’re energy, we’re just going to transform. We’re faithful beings. Many of us know we’re going to enter into full consciousness.” If you’re a Christian then you know you’re going to meet the face of Jesus and etc etc etc. This night I was begging them to lie flight me out of there and then they started saying to me, I just said this is really funny now that I look back on it. But at the moment I didn’t know what was happening and the reason why I ended up in the grass was because you know there’s a little distance between the Maloca the ceremony room, and restrooms and on my way back into the Maloca I’m like, “Lay me down right here.” And I ended up off the little pathway and into the grass and you know, my friend is like, “Get her mat.” You know, I said I can’t go back in there because I need to be close to the bathroom because it was really pretty profuse a time, and my jungle son, they said, get her some sugar water so there is a way that when it’s intense for you to bring down the effects and he ran back to the main lodge and brought me sugar water. I’m drinking sugar water then he ran back again to bring me limes with salt and so basically the electrolytes brings you back and then they went and got me bananas. I said I just need a banana. I just need a banana and this poor kid because it’s a long way back to the lodge and it became a big joke. Meanwhile, everybody in the Maloca is yelling out at me, “Mama Bear we love you.” I was the mom of all that trip and those people, as the oldest one there I think but those people ended up becoming like all my children and great dear loves of my life and I was getting the support of everyone and it did ease. And after that experience, I heard, I was able to communicate with the spirits so profoundly that the spirit said to me when I was in the toilet the next night I was like, what is going on? And the spirit said this is cancer leaving your body because medical intuitive said I had a lot of cancer in my body. This is cancer leaving your body, this is virus leaving your body, this is bacteria and toxins leaving your body, and these are the curses that were spoken over you leaving your body from past relationships and experiences. And so that said, sit with this because I was like opening up the door because it was the vileness that left my body that I couldn’t handle. It was making me feel sicker and the spirit said, no you close the door because I was like sticking my head out the door. This is really graphic. \xa0 \xa0 37:38 Ashley James:\xa0It was like a porta potty or something? You just like open the door and stick your head out. \xa0 \xa0 37:45 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Oh no, but they’re smaller. You know, I was able to, but no they’re full working flushing toilets, running water back and everything. Yeah, beautifully appointed and you know still people are saying we love you and they can hear me and I can hear them and at this point and you know you do hear people purging, you do hear people crying some people are crying because they’re there for an emotional release. Which I got later in my month long journey that I just went on but those but my initial visit to the jungle, because you know my health was so dire and that first trip wasn’t enough. I ended up having to come back, but because my health was in such bad shape. So you know, I will say this even after just three ceremonies, my joints were able to loosen up and I literally was like stiff man walking around, not able to bend my knees or ankles or move my hips in either direction. And I was able to move in all directions without pain and suffering and that never came back. \xa0 \xa0 38:49 Ashley James:\xa0Well. Okay, like you just told me you teach yoga at IBM every week. In San Francisco and then you had to miss yesterday because you we’re flying across the country. And so, here I am sitting here thinking like she’s a yoga teacher now. Like, she has to go back, when I first met you, you had scleroderma. You were stiff man couldn’t bend your knees. \xa0 \xa0 39:14 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. \xa0 \xa0 39:15 Ashley James:\xa0And now you’re teaching yoga to IBM employees. \xa0 \xa0 39:20 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0It was my knees. My knees were so bad. And you know when I say I was brought to my knees? I was brought to my knees. Literally. \xa0 \xa0 39:32 Ashley James:\xa0So do you still have scleroderma, are you completely in remission? Or is that completely gone from your body? \xa0 \xa0 39:39 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Well, the month that I spent, so this is what happened. So I wasn’t working with the best shaman and at the beginning, we didn’t know what we didn’t know. I ended up coming back that following March with my husband and with my friend and another group of people and was working with the same shaman. And so went through more, more deep healing, more deep healing, and the iron he is that I caught hepatitis A in my travels earlier that year. And so that’s why we went back in March and I had caught hepatitis A and I had been in the hospital and almost died in January of 2018. So I also discovered that I had parasitic infections from travels to Asia years before that had infiltrated my liver, my kidneys, my ducts, everywhere in my body and I couldn’t get rid of it. And that seemed to progress no matter how many cleanses I did and yes I saw many parasites and some of it was a spiritual thing. And when you learn about that, when you learn that there’s a spiritual and energetic connection to everything I had I won’t go into detail, but I had of who or where it came from, but I had a dark energetic you know, a curse I don’t know what else to call it, that was attached to me – entity, being. I’m not sure if it was an energy or being, it doesn’t matter. But the shaman that I ended up working with, they cleared that from my energetic body. And that was the whole the opening of my work field. And because I had been so weakened from disease my whole life, I didn’t have that force field. And I didn’t know because if you’re not aware of it, you can’t really pray against it or whatever. Because I’m a strong spiritual person. How did this happen? And it was another strong spiritual person. That it was actually one of the original shamans that had some dark energy and it had because I was in a weakened state attached to me and that is a whole another story, right? \xa0 \xa0 41:44 Ashley James:\xa0A whole another story. You know, Eric Throton talks about that, the guy I told you about that I’ve interviewed before. He talks about that kind of stuff. And my first session with him, he helped me remove some stuff that was like that. That was with me since I was nine. That had me hearing voices. And I thought it was my voice until I realized that those voices were totally out of alignment. Like these voices wanted me to eat McDonald’s. I’m like, I haven’t eat McDonald’s in nine years. What are you talking about? And so that’s when I got the cravings I kept having or not, were not physical cravings. They were like a voice in my head saying, “Let’s eat this, let’s eat that, or whatever.” Or it would make these the negative entity or whatever you could call it would make me question. Like when someone says something nice would be like, she didn’t really mean that, she doesn’t like you or whatever, it’s like having a mean girl in my head basically. \xa0 \xa0 42:46 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And really causing you to feel negative. And what that does is that attracts more negativity. So this is what I’ve learned energetically and vibrationally. This is where we live, we know that there are energies, entities, beings that are amongst us, and some are light, and some are the opposite of light. And so you know, I learned so much on this solitary journey. So I have so much to tell you on this call all day. So what I learned in June, and I’ve known a lot about this, but what I’ve learned is that we’re all here to clean our vibration, right? Through our beliefs, through our faith or trust, through our opening to spirit, through our intentions. And so when we know that there is negative influence, we can detach ourselves from that, right? And we can say, “But wait a minute, that’s not true.” That’s not true. Because what happens is there’s these negative energies and these entities and these beings that are roaming on earth, and their entry point is when you’ve dropped your faith, your trust of the truth, which is you were created as an intentional being and as a divine express an extension of the Most High, you are one with the source of all things. And when you believe less or of that of yourself, that is an entry point, right? Also our behavior patterns. If there is addiction, it is not your true essence that’s addicted. It is a negative influence that is being fed from that addiction. It’s the negative one that has the addiction and living off that addiction through you. Does that make sense? \xa0 \xa0 44:25 Ashley James:\xa0Yes, absolutely. \xa0 \xa0 44:28 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0So some of these are spirits that haven’t crossed over. And that’s a whole another topic of discussion. I’ll have to come back for about this. But I saw it, I learned it. And the thing about Ayahuasca that I want to share with everyone is that while the greatest part of it wasn’t getting disease out of my body. The best part of it is the amplification, the expansion of infinite intelligence and knowledge and connection that doesn’t leave or just doesn’t live in the jungle, it comes with back with you. So that’s why so many people repeat going back, they want to go back for deeper knowledge. So there are people that go back once a year, once every two years, you know, you’ll hear people that are podcasting about it all the time. Because the knowledge that they gained, the cosmic knowledge that they gained. I actually gained a lot of galactical knowledge and cosmic knowledge and connection to these very, very, very high dimensional beings. The connection to Yeshua, and the angelic realm was so profound. And it’s with me now all the time. \xa0 \xa0 45:42 Ashley James:\xa0So when you’re lying on the mat in between the trips to the bathroom, in the dark hearing the intense noise of the jungle, how do you receive this information? Like you said, you take this information home with you, this connection, this information. How do you receive it? You’re lying again, like I want to paint that picture. We’re lying on the mat in a thatched hut that’s round, pitch dark with the very loud jungle noises. And we’re sweating, possibly vomiting, going to the bathroom, but in between that, we’re seeing colors, we’re receiving information. So how did you receive it? Can you take us back to that, like give us a play by play? \xa0 \xa0 46:30 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Absolutely. So you know typically for most people, it’s about 30 minutes to an hour in that they feel the effect of the medicine except for yours truly. I’m like five minutes in and everybody goes, “Oh, there she goes.” But that was you know, the medicine at the time I was probably partaking in too much medicine. Now they give me like a tablespoon. They say, “No, no, no, no. No mas para Teresita.” “No more for Theresa.” I’m like the little baby, you know what I mean, I have no resistance. And for some people, they have to drink two full cups. But it just depends, and I don’t know the explanation of that. So what happens is when it goes dark, in other words the lights go out, the shamans have partaken in their medicine. And part of at the beginning of the ceremony, they are coming around with the Mapacho, and they are blessing you with the Mapacho and the space, they are clearing it and clearing it and clearing it and clearing it. So only the divine is there. All right, because we all bring some negative in there. And they’re clearing it out for you constantly. They’re saying their prayers, and then when they partake in the medicine, out go the lights. So you’re sitting there and that you’re just waiting, right and you’re feeling the medicine. And at first you’re feeling some effects in the stomach or what have you. And you know, I’ve learned not to fear whatever my body is feeling. And I just go into the medicine is working. The medicine is working. And that becomes my mantra, I’m always in prayer. I’m always talking to Yeshua, I’m always talking to God and the angels. And then the shamans start singing the sacred songs of the medicine called the Icaros. The Icaros and that’s when they are in the medicine. And the icaros is what activates the medicine deeper in you and into the dimensions of your energetic body and into the spirit realm. So they are actually able to see what’s going on with you through the Icaros. And they’ll say, “Concentrado.” Concentrate on the Icaros and you’re listening to the song. Since I’ve started talking about this, I am getting chills up and down my spine in my body, I don’t know if you’re feeling this but I am. It is so sacred, the Icaros, and this Ancient Medicine that’s been going on, they don’t even know when it started or exactly where, but all of the tribes along the Amazon and in South America, and in Central America, literally do the same thing, but they may have a little bit of different tradition with how they serve it or what have you. But they all know about this medicine. And they all sing these songs. And they had no communication with each other. They believe that the divine source of all things taught their ancestors about this medicine, so that you can connect deeper to the spirit realm and into the multiverse, the multi dimensional space where you have infinite knowledge and infinite healing and infinite connection. And so all these tribes they’ve been doing it forever. And so, this tribe is called the Shipibo Tribe, and the Shipibo Tribe they have their Shipibo language, and they’re singing these songs and it is music that you’ve never heard before, words you’ve never heard before. And you stay connected to the shamans through the Icaros. So no matter what your journey is, and I will say sometimes you do see some things that are not necessarily pleasant and beautiful. And you allow it to pass through, a lot of times it’s your own fear showing up that has been locked away, locked away, locked away in your subconscious mind and in your energetic body that finds its way out through the medicine and through the Shamanism and through the sacred songs of the Icaros. The Icaros are blessings and they then, so there’s different rounds of it. So when it begins and it builds an intensity, and then after a while there’s a turning point. Sometimes though, I’ve had experiences where it got more profound as the night went on. And you are together in the ceremony room until the shamans close the ceremony and then for some time afterwards, because the medicine is still working and they’re still working, but they’re not singing the Icaros anymore. And then there’s a lightness that takes over a lot of times, and there could be giggling, celebrating and then eventually you make your way with the facilitators back to your cottage. \xa0 \xa0 48:38 Ashley James:\xa0What time is it by then? \xa0 \xa0 51:25 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0It really just depends on the size of the how many people are in the ceremony, because the last portion of it is the shamans come to your mat individually. And oh my God, that is just the most profound experience that I could even begin to try to explain and especially when you’re working with these, the ones that really helped me heal; the mother and the son, and one is on one side and one is on the other. And they’re holding your hand and you feel their beauty and their love. And literally the feeling of love, universal love that comes through them for you, that you then have in turn for them and everything on earth and for God is just life changing that you will never forget for the rest of your life. \xa0 \xa0 52:14 Ashley James:\xa0So obviously, they don’t speak English, or do they speak English? \xa0 \xa0 52:20 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0They speak Spanish. \xa0 \xa0 52:21 Ashley James:\xa0Is there a translator there ? \xa0 \xa0 52:23 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes, the owner is, she’s Peruvian, but she’s lived the last 28 years or something in Miami. So she speaks English. And also my friend that took us down there, he’s fluent in Spanish and English. And so he’s an amazing translator. And they also have facilitators that they bring, so there’s always someone that’s not under the influence of the medicine that’s there and they translate, they help you to the bathroom, they give you the sugar water if you need it or whatever you need, they’re there for you. Listen, I have never been taken care of the way that I’ve been taken care of down there. They are with you on the journey. And they know what you’re going through. So they’re there for you and you know, they call me Mama Teresita down there as I just have this mother energy right for everybody. And so they love on me and literally when I left there at the end of June, I was in tears because these people, the people that work there that cook your food, that bring you what you need in your room, that help you no matter what, they serve you out of love. And it is one of the most unique experiences I’ve ever had. And I’ve traveled the world. And the beauty of these people trying to help you through your healing process is a selflessness that is an extension of love from the universe. And you leave feeling loved. \xa0 \xa0 53:59 Ashley James:\xa0That’s brilliant. So depending on how large the group is, I’m trying to paint that picture in my mind. When do you get back to your room to actually sleep and do you sleep that night? \xa0 \xa0 54:13 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0You know, maybe a little bit, but you’re really in the effects of the medicine still. And you may have dreams or more visionary experience or you know, and you’re talking to your roomie or whatever, but you do rest. There’s a lot of resting that goes on. And what I noticed when you come back from the jungle is the high pace we live here. And the toxic environment that we’re in. It is such a profound difference from in the jungle to coming back to the States. So as I recommend everybody get to nature as often as possible because the plants here and the trees here they have a healing vibration to them that we don’t have in the concrete jungle. Now you live in nature. So you know, thank God, right. But we do have a lot of stuff that keeps us from deep healing here when you live in a city, like where my husband and I live now. But so it depends, like we had groups of 10 up to 18 and the several times that I’ve gone there, and we would probably get back to the room at 1:00 am. \xa0 \xa0 55:12 Ashley James:\xa0Okay, that’s not bad. I was thinking it would be like an all nighter or something. \xa0 \xa0 55:17 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0There are some that choose to stay. If you choose to stay or the medicine is still working, these shamans that we work with will not leave you, they will stay with you till the sun comes up. If you want to go back to the bed and they release you to go back to your bed, because I have a funny curvature in my spine, my tailbone sticks out and the mat on the ground is uncomfortable for me after a while. So I like to go back to the bed myself personally. But I have stayed in the Maloca till the sun came up. And then other times I’m like, I want to go back to my bed. It’s because more comfortable for me, my body. But many people stay all night there and go back when the sun comes up. So it just depends. When I was there and it was just the shamans and me, our ceremony would be over at 10, started at 8, over at 10. Other times when there’s lots of people because remember, they go around to each person individually that takes longer. And so sometimes the ceremony will be over at 1am. And then you still have a period of where they won’t let you leave the Maloca. Where you need to stay there for the effects, because you’re still under the medicine. Does that make sense? \xa0 \xa0 56:32 Ashley James:\xa0Sure. Sure. So your first time, the first 10 day trip, when you came back to the States, what was your biggest takeaway? What was the biggest healing? Did you notice that your scleroderma was getting better? Like what was the definite “This is what I got from my first trip to the jungle?” \xa0 \xa0 56:52 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Oh my gosh. Well, there was some confusion because I had old, old religious dogmatic interference, that first trip at some points, you know what I mean? Like, Oh, my God. Is this the right thing? I had a lot of… \xa0 \xa0 57:11 Ashley James:\xa0Are you letting the devil in? \xa0 \xa0 57:12 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Totally, totally. I had some of that. And that was great that I faced that because oh my God, I saw the face of Jesus so many times, and angels and him showing me things. And later in the other trips that I went. But I came back. So that happened during the experience. But I came back going, this is the most amazing thing I’ve ever done in my life. And I’ve done a lot of things. And I told my husband, we’re going back and you’re coming with me. And I told everybody I knew, you guys got to come, you got to come, you got to come, you got to come. I literally have lost friends over this because there’s so much fear in them and they got tired of hearing it. I was so on fire for this because I had this connection to like downloads, constant downloads, because when you get home, that’s when the journey really begins. \xa0 \xa0 58:08 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, I bet. \xa0 \xa0 58:09 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0So you are like in boot camp while you’re there. But when you get home, that’s where you are really reconnecting to it, connecting to it, connecting to it. And you do over time, like some of the effects because the medicine stays in you and still works with you, right. So you do and especially once you’ve been there for as long of a time and had as much medicine, like I’ve had 27 nights. 27 experiences with Ayahuasca and that’s a lot in a year and a half. Wow, I think it was like 15 months, 27 ceremonies, that’s a lot. And especially this last time when I went for my 28 day excursion, I had 12 nights of Ayahuasca. When you’re there for a longer period the dose is less, it’s more like micro dosing because it’s more about the healing effects of the actual medicine. So this last journey that I went on by myself, because I had been one other time with this mother, daughter, son, I mean mother, son, shaman family, she said to me, “You need to come by yourself, and you need to come for at least a month.” And so when this parasitic infection wouldn’t go away that I’ve had for years, I had just didn’t have enough medicine. I wasn’t there long enough. So I had to go deep. And I had to be there for the month. And I thank God for the parasites. Because it forced me to say to my husband, I gotta go. And he said, “Go.” So when I got back at the end of June, I said to my husband, you’re next and arranged his ticket, made the arrangements and one month later, my husband left for the jungle for a month and he got back at the end of August. \xa0 \xa0 59:51 Ashley James:\xa0And he went without you. \xa0 \xa0 59:53 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. Solo journey is… You know, I love it that we went with group, that I went by myself with a group and that we went twice together with a group. And then we went on our solo journey. And it’s changed him as much as it’s changed me. And by changing what I mean is, it’s almost like all these layers of falsities of teachings of culture. Things that are programmed, literally peel off of you so that you become this lighter, vibratory being that has connection to the truth and what really matters. \xa0 \xa0 1:00:39 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. So tell me about your physical your physical healing, removing these parasites and everything. Because it sounds like your scleroderma gone? Is it in remission? \xa0 \xa0 1:00:54 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yeah. So halfway through in June. That’s why I went. So each time I went, I had profound experiences, visionary experiences, and you asked me, how is it that you learn? I see things, okay. So I see, I saw things that were yet to come, that came to pass, I saw how things about my children, I was brought to my children in the spirit realm. And there was one visionary experience that was the most beautiful thing because you know, my children went through some trauma in their past in their childhood. And I was dressed as a priestess in this one vision where I was dressing and blessing my daughter and my son, both as a priest and a priestess. And I saw my little doggy and I’d be blessing her, I saw things about my husband and I, I saw things about my relationship with my parents, my siblings, friends, I saw people that I was to let go of, then I saw relationships that I was to heal deeper. I was brought to an understanding of how to heal relationships. And that came to pass. I saw what to do in my business. I saw how I was to be a hands on healer and that I would pray over people and they would be healed through my connection to the source and through the divine beings, Yeshua, the angels in these other high dimensional beings, that would work through me, I just became a more open vessel as a result of it. And I was to do it. And I said, “Okay, I trust you.” And then simple things like, you know, take up the piano again, that’s going to enrich your life, take up the pottery, start sewing again, because I had become so focused on my health, on others, on my husband, on my business, and on everything else, when I had lost taking the time to be the creative person that I always was since I was a little girl. So when I was there in June, and I remember walking around in my bare feet, now I’m in my bare feet in the jungle, you know what I’m saying? I’m not scared. I’m walking around in the jungle in my bare feet. And I was brought back to when I was a really, really small little child at five years old. And I was always the barefoot one in the yard. And I was brought back to that to the joy of being barefoot in the grass. And I remembered and I reconnected to the inner child so much that I’m playing the piano every day again, I’m doing creative things. And I make a point every day to do something creative for the fun of it. For the joy of it. And as entrepreneurs, and you know, I do six different things. Yoga is a creative outlet for me, I’m business development for my husband, I’m writing a book, I’ve got this new class I’m launching, I’ve just started a charity, I’ve got lots of things that I’m doing, I’m helping with my mom. You know, there’s many different projects I have ongoing, but I’m taking time every day, even if it’s just 30 minutes, to do the thing just for the sake of creativity, because the Creator is creative. And as an expression of the Creator, when we create, we are accessing that vibration of creation. Which is the step beyond manifestation is creation. And that is something for us all. And I encourage and challenge everyone, what is the thing that you love that you don’t think you have time for because it’s not, you know, making you money, or, you know, the bathroom needs to be cleaned, or so and so wants to talk to you on the phone? Or there’s a Netflix show. You know, take some time on the daily, even if it’s 15 20 minutes, and you’re going to find that your vibration is going to lift and your vitality will lift. Your energy will lift. More creative ideas come, and actually you know what comes? Happiness and joy. Because we can get bogged down with oh my gosh, is that marketing working? Oh my gosh, what are the analytics Duffy? Am I right? \xa0 1:05:36 Ashley James:\xa0We can definitely get bogged down with the day to day and lose that connection. \xa0 \xa0 1:05:42 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And you would think maybe an empty nester, right? And not running the kids here and not running the kids there that I would have had more energy toward that. But what happened was, you know, my husband and I became really focused on business. And that’s not my mindset. That was more his mindset. And I absorbed that. And I molded myself to that. And the more I did that, the sicker I got. \xa0 \xa0 1:06:12 Ashley James:\xa0Sure. \xa0 \xa0 1:06:14 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And so and it’s so funny, because he came home going… And when I came home, and while he was gone, because we traveled and we traveled in July, and then my dog got sick. And I had like three weeks of just caring for my little doggy and bringing her back from the brink. And he was gone during that time, I started playing the piano again. And it was like the message was so clear, creativity is your way, Theresa. So I started painting and I started you know, I’m going to do needlepoint and just little things I can do in the evenings rather than just sitting doing nothing or watching TV or whatever, you know, because my energy is still coming back and I’m still under the influence of a lot of the plant medicine. And I’ll go back to that experience of the plant medicine but, and my husband came home saying, “We gotta get you a pottery class and you need to play the piano.” And we started giggling it’s like your way, Teresa to health is creativity. \xa0 \xa0 1:07:05 Ashley James:\xa0He came from the jungle and that’s what he told you? \xa0 \xa0 1:07:08 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:07:09\xa0 Ashley James:\xa0And he didn’t know that you spent the last month playing the piano and doing all that. So he got the message you got. That’s funny. \xa0 \xa0 1:07:16 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. \xa0 \xa0 1:07:18\xa0 Ashley James:\xa0I love it. \xa0 \xa0 1:07:18 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And totally supportive, not like Theresa where you clean the apartment. You know? No. And it’s beautiful. It’s beautiful, because he went through the journey himself. And he knows what he needs to do for himself now. \xa0 \xa0 1:07:32 Ashley James:\xa0So you receive messages for yourself and your loved ones. And you just get clarity. Do you think it’s that we all have the ability to be intuitive and get in touch with it, and that the medicine just pulls the ego aside and pulls all the business aside so that we can actually receive the intuition we always have? \xa0 \xa0 1:07:55 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0We are born this way. However, through teachings, culture, wounds, ego, everything that happens it gets clouded. And we run on these programs a lot of times under the radar and you know, a big proponent of changing your belief systems through your neural pathways. But there are some wounds that stay stuck that you don’t know that they’re there. That you’re like, “Oh my gosh, I didn’t even know.” And so that’s what the medicine brings to light are the things that are so deeply embedded that you’re not even aware. There was one night when we were with the group and the shamans were like, “No. Muy poquito, Teresita.” Where I got like a teaspoon and everybody else’s… And I’m like, la la la, I’m just having a good time. You know what I mean? And when people started going through their experience, I started worrying about everybody. And the message that I got from that experience was see what happens if we don’t kick your butt and make you down the toilet and face down, you won’t concentrate on yourself, you are so used to carrying so much more about everybody else. That one of your lessons is, now is the time to care for you. \xa0 \xa0 1:09:16 Ashley James:\xa0Very good. \xa0 \xa0 1:09:17 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And that happens to a lot of moms in the world. And a lot of people pleasers in the world. And one of the messages I got while I was in the jungle and my father appeared, not in ceremony. But my father who’s… a cross over appeared. There was another guest there and she’s a medium and a clairvoyant. And, you know, she said, “Look, I know we just met, we just met like 30 minutes before.” She goes, “Where’s your dad?” And I said, “Well, he’s crossed over.” And she said, “Well, he’s here and he’s standing right behind you.” Describe him to a tee. And said to me, “I really want to tell you that your dad is here, and he has messages for you.” And I was like, awesome, what’s the saying? And she said, “He wants you to know that he approves. And apparently that was a big deal for you. And that in your life, you’ve sought approval from others because you wanted his approval. And you didn’t feel like you ever got it.” He was a critical man in the human form. And how true words were never spoken over my life and seeking that approval became this people pleasing aspect of my personality. And so when people didn’t approve of me, it was a really deep, deep, deep pain. Well, people that I loved and cared about. Okay, and so friends, and when people didn’t approve of it, and it’s really interesting, when I came back from my Ayahuasca journeys, many people have left me including somebody that was my very best friend for many, many, many years. \xa0 \xa0 1:10:50 Ashley James:\xa0Wow. \xa0 \xa0 1:10:52 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And that has been super painful for me to digest. But again, it’s like right now I’m on this path. And they’re gonna be some people that it’s going to be polarizing. And I want to say to the listeners, however, whatever path you decide to take towards your own healing and enlightenment, there are going to be people that are going to not like it. And I saw, I think like Denzel Washington said it or maybe Morgan Freeman or somebody that, you know, it’s basically I’m summarizing, I don’t remember exactly, but you know, it’s the light in me is disturbing the darkness of you. And that’s okay. And not to make me better than anybody else. I’m just, you know, a little bit down the pike right? Down the path, because I said yes, and because I surrendered. And because I said I am here on earth to be all that God created me to be. And so I surrender to that, even if it meant having to move from Lake Tahoe my favorite place on Earth, even if it meant I had to go through the depths of suffering in order to release and be brought to my knees. So I can say in a deeper way, because I’ve said this prayer my whole life. But this is a newness, and a true, I am nothing without the breath of God inside me. And I learned that deeper than ever, and the rest of these false fears that we have of rejection and abandonment. And what are people going to think of me? And and the old ego wants to come out even with this class that my husband, you know, my husband’s in the tech world and deals with professionals at a very high level that run billion dollar companies. And he’s now posting about channeled messages from Jesus through my wife. He said to me this week, he’s like, “Oh, my gosh, babe, I’ve really grown.” He’s like, and I realized there was still a little piece of me like, “Oh, my God, are people gonna think we’re nuts.” \xa0 \xa0 1:12:50 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:12:51 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Listen, what could be better? This is what we’re here for. This is what we’re all here for. And I I’m so dizzy in the spirit right now. Because, you know, there’s going to be a healing vibration to this in this podcast. Even my toe is tingling. Because it’s true. And by the way, I learned to Yeshua. It really is. And that’s what’s going to be explained on this masterclass series for people that were raised in the Christian faith or not, and it’s not about how you were raised and it’s not about religion. And I saw in the multiverse, I saw in other dimensions and so what happened with the healing in June, so I went back, the minute that I got there, they knew I was coming. Everybody’s greeting me, they knew in advance I had a two week notice. Well, no, I think I had, no not two weeks, it was about nine days. And I had been on a four month parasite cleanse and literally the level of parasites that were coming out of me and it wasn’t stopping. Okay, so I couldn’t get rid of it on my own and with many, many, many holistic therapies, and drinks, and Western medicine, anti parasitic, it didn’t matter what I was taking, it was not getting better, it was only getting worse. And really, the parasites were trying to take me out. And I had a lot to do with that whole dark energy thing. It had a hold on me. And so when I got there, the shaman said you were very close to dying. And so this was an intervention. And I knew it. I told my husband five days before I left, I said I don’t, or maybe it was 10 days before I left I don’t remember exactly, it might have been right before I said I got to go for the month. I said I don’t think I’m going to live past this. And he said go, so we did I called Nancy the owner and I said I gotta go for the month. She goes good. I’m going to then. And let’s go. We met in Iquitos, went to her place in the jungle, walked up the stairs together, I video documented my entire experience. There will be a documentary about it coming out soon and I’m writing a book about it ‘Dreaming With The Shaman: The Unlikely Love Affair Between an Amazon and an American Woman. \xa0 1:15:06 Ashley James:\xa0Oh, beautiful. I love it. \xa0 \xa0 1:15:08 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Because it’s the last place I ever wanted to go on earth. And at least I thought now I have this grand love affair with it, I can’t wait to go back. And so the minute I stepped foot on the grounds, I knew my healing would happen and I walked up those stairs to the lodge and greeted the people that know me as mama Teresita and started drinking medicine right then. So there’s thousands of medicines and when they know what you need, okay, when they assess you, these shamans through ceremony, they will put you through what you’re going through, you do this, you know that you have these conversations with Nancy the owner ahead of time, so when you get there, they have medicine waiting for you and how did they get the medicine? They go out in the jungle, they dig up a route they cut down some bark they trim a plant whatever and they come and they make these tinctures or if it’s something external, these these sabs or drinks, right and so some are hot, some are room temperature, some are boiled, some are leaves that they grind down in a mortar and pestle and steep it different ways for different medicines. And I was on about seven different medicines during the day. And then I had 12 ceremonies with Ayahuasca which was the most beautiful thing ever. I’m now godmother to the mother shaman there to her granddaughter, and the son sharman to his daughter. And they are my family now. And about halfway through she said the root of your disease is gone. \xa0 \xa0 1:16:49 Ashley James:\xa0Did you feel it? \xa0 \xa0 1:16:50 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. Because I wasn’t able to eat, I wasn’t able to go to the bathroom before I left. I wasn’t able to breathe before I left. The minute I was was there I was breathing and I was going to the bathroom. I wasn’t able to urinate. My kidneys were that inflamed. And food was hard for me. I was I was down to hardly eating anything. And I was eating massive amounts of food while I was down there, they had a food, specific foods, but I was definitely on the diet that they were giving me specifics and delicious. The food tastes better down there. The soil is so rich in South America. So and she said but the wounds are still there. So this is the most fascinating part. She didn’t know what scleroderma was. They don’t have anatomy books, and they don’t go to medical school. They see your body from an energetic standpoint, okay. And what she said to me was, the wounds are still there. And I said, “Well, what are the wounds look like to you?” And you know, the translation is going and she said, they look like and she said they’re from your brain all over your brain to the bottom of your feet. I can testify to the brain because I had had a neurological event after you and I spoke and I was in the ER for that. And I had white matter and some growths in my brain and all of that, that I never really did, you know, go down that path was allopathically for it. And so she said, “They look like scabs that have come off. And there’s a scar that’s left, big ones.” And it’s my whole entire body. And that is exactly what scleroderma does. Its scars. \xa0 \xa0 1:18:32 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:18:35 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And so the healing is taking place, right? And so while she was down in the jungle with Victor, one night, because I was still you know, I wasn’t feeling that great about a month ago, still I’m in the healing process, right? So I have to be patient with that. And I have to be very fine tuned to my diet. And what I’m taking in and negative energy and what happens is, you become super open energetically and man oh man, oh, man. Do you become acutely aware of negative energy in your life, through the television, through the computer, through who you talk to, people you’re around, what you’re eating, what you’re drinking, you become aware of energy. So your job and what I realized, is our job is to keep our energy clean. How do you do it? Lots of techniques to clean in your energy, right? There’s lots of things; grounding, visuals, meditations, prayers, but I would say right away, what I learned is cleaning your physical body is essential. And it’s step one, because that’s what they do in Shamanism. The cleaner your body is the less purging that you go through really, because honestly in those 12 ceremonies I purged from the medicine during the day that they were giving me and I purged through so much of that, right? That my ceremonies were easy. Easier than I ever imagined. There were a couple nights that were hard. When the night that I faced this dark entity. Because I said to the shaman when we discovered it, and they told me about it, and we know who it came from. And it was powerful because it came through another shaman. And that’s why it’s important to know your shamans. And I said tonight’s the night. I didn’t come here for this when I first came down here. I came here to get healing and I want it gone tonight. And the minute that I said it, I started feeling a choking feeling and pressure on me and I started doing my own prayer work and calling in beings to help me. And that night was a hard night. And after that it got easier. So what other questions do you have? You were asking me what it’s like? Like, how do you get the information. So it’s visual, sometimes. Sometimes it’s feeling. And you’ll get the thoughts in your head associated with the feeling. And you won’t actually see a picture right in your in your mind’s eye. And sometimes it’s just this clairsentience and claircognizance where it’s a knowingness. And that stays with you after you leave, you will just know things. And you will just go. I just know it and I trust it. So you become more confident in your intuitive abilities. \xa0 \xa0 1:21:24 Ashley James:\xa0Very cool. So after the shaman saw that your scleroderma, the root of the scleroderma was gone, what did she say about healing the scar tissue? \xa0 \xa0 1:21:37 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Oh, she said, it’s just going to take time, the medicine will keep working. And it’s just going to take a few months for the damage to be healed. And you know, watch my diet, go back to some regular foods, because you’re without salt, you’re without sugar, you’re without fats, you’re without a lot of things that you need for your body. And so when you’re done with the dieta, when you come home, you stay on it for a while, and then you start adding some things back slowly. Because it becomes like a shock to the system and you cannot feel well. And I think that happened to me. And we know like for some people, you have to stay on the diet more strict for a longer period of time than others. And because I’m so sensitive personally, and I would recommend that people do that when they come back if you’re there for a long period of time. And so she just kept saying to me, it’s your mind now, relax, rest your mind. Because energetically you know, our mind races around. And you really when you’re in the jungle, you become very attuned to that. And so when you unplug, and you don’t have this visual stimuli with our screens that we do, and that causes our brains to really speed up its activity, traffic, stress of money, whatever, it speeds up the brain. And so then when you’re there, it’s like, everything comes to a stop. But you become finally acutely attuned to how rapid your brain is moving and worrying and wanting going down rabbit holes of excuse my language. And what would happen is, I would get a bad headache from it. And she would have to do during the day, she’d have to do these things over my head. She’s like, rest your mind, quit worrying, quit worrying, shut demanding about it, it’s pointing that made, stop it. For them, they’re in such a peaceful state. See, they don’t worry. They’re so connected to the present. And you know, as a coach about reducing anxiety and getting over panic, that it comes from the mind, and then it gets triggered in the body. So then we have those physiological responses. And I would say it is the silent chronic disease of America and Western culture. \xa0 \xa0 1:24:09 Ashley James:\xa0Absolutely. \xa0 \xa0 1:24:13 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0I guarantee nine out of 10 people, even people that are in the business that we’re in, still have anxiety at some low level that maybe they’re not completely aware of, or that they’re picking up from the community around them vibrationally, because when you go down there, and you’ll be like, wait a minute, what’s that pot and I was like, well, you just shut up, I was so mad at my mind. But it was really the medicine was showing me how overactive it is. And that when I come home, it was going to be essential for me to kick up the yoga to kick up the prayers to kick up the meditations and to catch myself from the old habit of rabbit hole thinking you know, what happens if this, this, this, this, in six months from now and and we’re really taught that with this movement of manifesting, which I’ve taught, right? With self development and personal development and writing your goals down. And I’m going to manifest the hundred thousand dollars a year this year with the online coaching world with that, right? Now, I’m not saying what are your desires, there’s a difference between focusing on what you want to manifest and it occurred to me and my husband from these downloads. I’m like, “Oh my gosh, we got this wrong.” And I’m not saying it’s a good step to learn that you’re a powerful manifestor, right? But we’re manifesting all the time. And when you’re putting out the vibration of I want this, my husband and I, we want this ranch, either in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, on the Tahoe side, maybe California, I don’t know. We want a ranch with a space where we can bring people in for masterminds and retreats. And we want it to be our home and a retreat place and horses and nature and blah, blah, blah. We were so focused on what we didn’t have and working at manifesting that we were putting out unknowingly the vibration, even though we were coming at it from and we had this ranch, well, we know we don’t have it really. And we were constantly focused on what we didn’t have, that we were still putting out that vibration of what we didn’t have, even though we were coming at it from a manifestation standpoint. And so now, and now we realize that with the divine creator, we surrender now, if that isn’t the highest will and it’s a vision of the highest will for our life, as we’re becoming all that we were created to be as a divine unique expression of God, then yes, but we’re going to be okay, if it’s something else too. \xa0 \xa0 1:27:03 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:27:03 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0We’re going to, we’re going to be like the wind. So we’ve released our attachment. And that moves us into a state of trust. And that we’re going to know, because we’re going to be divinely guided. And so when that becomes your focus, when you focus on the big desire, which is to be all that we were created to be through this unconditional love and guidance, and through the help of helpers like Yeshua, like the angels, like other dimensional beings, Therapists Bay that works with me, which is the divine architect that takes things from an energetic standpoint and helps you manifest it into physical matter here on Earth. I discovered him this last time in June that he was working through me or for me, and because of me, and how great is that? And I’m humbled by it. And those many others, and Yogananda as well I didn’t realized he was one of my guides and no wonder I’m doing yoga again, you know, and oh my gosh, it was just so beautiful. And connecting with these energies of these beings, these Christ Consciousness beings. And knowing that all is okay, just like it is right now. And that is the key to letting go of the anxiety, the monkey brain, the worry, the stress is really becoming focused right now in your senses and knowing that that truth of who you are will emerge and is emerging, that you were coming here to be all that you were created to be and that as a divine unique expression of the Most High God I say God, people can say whatever they want; source, energy, vibration, creator, just a word, right, for the meaning of a being, of a truth, of an energetic reality. \xa0 \xa0 1:28:52 Ashley James:\xa0I love it. \xa0 \xa0 1:28:53 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0I love that gets wrapped with that one. \xa0 \xa0 1:28:55 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, I love that you have… \xa0 \xa0 1:28:58 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Theresa the preacher. \xa0 \xa0 1:29:01 Ashley James:\xa0But I love that you have had tremendous physical healing along with energetic, spiritual, mental, emotional, with this herbal medicine journey, but that you put your spiritual healing at the forefront. And your physical healing came along with it that it was a package deal. I love that you shared that. And you’ve got quite the mission that you’re working on. So you’ve got two things right now that you’ve launched. One, is a charity, I want to hear about that. And another is a mastermind that’s coming up. So let’s talk about your charity, it does come from one of your journeys to the jungle through Ayahuasca, did you have a vision to do this charity? \xa0\xa0 1:29:30 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0It is. It really is. And you know, but like I said, in order to really cleanse yourself so that you can energetically vibrate with this resonance, you have to clean the body too. Because we’re in the body right now. We’re not of the body, but we’re in the body, right? We’re more than that. We’re spirit living in a human physical reality at the moment. But the true reality is, is that we’re always connected to that energetic place. We have to clean the body too, it is a package deal. It’s hard to do good work from a sick bed. And let me tell you, it’s hard when you can’t move, and you don’t have the energy to get out of bed to be able to complete the mission. The vision was put on my heart since I was a little girl. So this is about 45 years in the making. Honestly, this is a soul yearning and calling that I came here to do. This is the deepest part of my calling, I believe, because it’s been with me my whole life. When I was little, and I share this when I was five years old. And out in the yard in my bare feet by myself, I had\xa0 this beautiful experience of being a mother to millions of children. And so my poor parents, you know, hearing things in the attic, and people around us and how many people are replaying with Theresa and I’d say millions, they’re like, what the heck, most kids have one imaginary friend. Theresa’s got millions of them. God only knows what they were thinking. But I would go out to this special place in the yard and I had dug this hole by the tree. It’s beautiful maple tree and I would throw in acorns and blades of grass and leaves. I had a stick and I would stir it up and I was making stew which is so like me, right? It’s so like me in the kitchen. And I was feeding everybody. And they would say, “Who are you feeding?” I would say, “Well, my children.” And they would say, “How many children do you have?” And I would say millions. And with an underbite and a list. And fast forward when I was over enough to really care about watching TV, because I wasn’t at the time I was really little. And I remember seeing maybe 10 years old, eight years old something, a news clips of the famine in Ethiopia and other places in Africa. And I remember crying. And I remember asking my mom why was this happening? And seeing starving children and it just left a mark and, and my mother remembers me saying and she told me this last year that I was maybe 10 or 11. And there was more famine and more shows. And I remember, she remembers me saying to her, I’m gonna do something about this. We have to do something, I would say. And so then I remember the one picture that we all have seen that was on the cover of Time Magazine or Life or something with a little boy that was crouched over, a starving African beautiful little boy and a vulture standing behind him. And I never forgot that picture. I remember crying and I cried a lot over the plight of these starving children. So this was a work in progress. And then in 2004, when I traveled to South Africa, and I was in the bush and some of these places where it wasn’t so much of that starvation, although they were hungry children. And I was there, I was there on a business trip with my ex husband. And I took my children and my ex mother-in law, beautiful woman that she is that I adore and another child that was with us. And we went out on this excursion to be able to visit these villages where they have very little resources and HIV has wiped out a generation of people, okay. And so these children are living with children or you know, they’re completely orphaned. And so there’s the elderly and children, and not a lot in between. And it’s so rampant. It’s the worst HIV population in the continent of Africa as in South Africa. And I made a vow. And I said, I’m going to come back and I’m going to help. And I’m going to build orphanages for these children, so they’re not sleeping outside. And 15 years later, I’m making good on that promise. And we already have the village, it’s the villages I went to, I’ve reconnected to the man that drove me that day, who was working for a conservation group that was no longer in existence. And last year after a trip to the jungle, this is how this works. I went to bed one night and the image in the end, the voice said to me, the spirit said to me, “Find him.” The one that drove me around. I was like what? Well, I seen him that one day, but I fell in love with his soul. And he said find this man and he’s going to be your boots on the ground, so to speak, for lack of a better term, you need someone that’s a local that knows how to get this done. You need to find him. I knew his name was Lotus. I knew where he worked in 2004. He was a representative of this conservation group. Well, that group was no longer in existence. He didn’t work at the one lodge I knew, and I went on a hunt. And about a month of emailing and making phone calls. Ashley, I get an email from Lotus, beautiful name for a man huh, Lotus. And he told me where he was working with, organization called the Africa Foundation. And we connected and we are partnering with this well established, they know how to get the job done, they know how to get employee salaries, they know how to get counselors in, they know how to get medical care in. And we are about to break ground this year. Our fundraising is beginning. We’re becoming legalized. In the meantime, we are partnered with\xa0AfricaFoundation.org. And they are going to help us build our first facility in the bush outside of Kruger National Park in South Africa. And so it’s coming to pass and the name of our group is\xa0MomsHouseForChildren.org. \xa0 \xa0 1:36:07 Ashley James:\xa0Beautiful and so is it Mom’s House is the charity? \xa0 \xa0 1:36:11 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. Yes. Mom’s House For Children is the charity. \xa0 \xa0 1:36:14 Ashley James:\xa0Mom’s House For Children. Love it. \xa0 \xa0 1:36:17 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And we have a website up. We’re a work in progress. We’re grassroots. It’s a family deal. My husband and children are involved. And we’re building our team, many of them are people I’ve sat in the jungle with and we’ve held each other’s hands through some of our most intense moments in life and have emerged fearless, the greatest gift of the jungle. And we’re ready to eradicate homelessness in the most vulnerable locations because there are 200 million homeless children where there are no resources, where there are no resources. And if we want to change this world, what do we do? We love the children, reunite the world. And that is our mission statement. \xa0 \xa0 1:37:09 Ashley James:\xa0I can’t even fathom 200 million children homeless. \xa0 \xa0 1:37:15 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. And in vulnerable locations, where criminal behavior happens, right? Because they need to feed them. So you know, starvation leads to many things, doing things these children would never do otherwise, or getting caught up with criminalization, or they’re they’re just doing whatever they can. Many 12 year olds are raising six siblings. So they’re not going to school, none of the kids are really able to go to school or not a lot of them. They’re having to find work. So it’s really, really severe plight and that isn’t even talking about, you know, other locales in the world where more sex trafficking and human trafficking takes place. So we solve a lot of problems by eradicating homelessness for the vulnerable children of the world. \xa0 \xa0 1:38:12 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, because then they don’t get into the drug trade and the sex trade and so they become child soldiers and all guerrilla warfare. And yeah, that makes sense. Get it at its root. Well, I love it. Congratulation. \xa0 \xa0 1:38:30 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Thank you so much. So it’s been, it’s been one of my lifelong dreams, and now is the time because they’re waiting. So I welcome all helpers of all varieties, into our movement of let’s put the children first. And what’s amazing is, is that it takes very little US dollars to create great change in these places. And, by the way, I’m a supporter of UNICEF, I’m a supporter of local charities for the homeless, the Homeless Coalition, No Kid Hungry program, we just signed up for them, Feeding America. So you know, also involved in Rotary and I do a lot of charity work, I feed the homeless over holiday seasons, my husband and I do just personally, we give, give, give, give, give all the time. So we do care about America. We care about Silicon Valley which has a great homeless population. We’re very involved in all of those things. I personally have a calling on me for Africa and some of these other world locations where the largest number of,vulnerable children live with with extremely little resources, including drinking water. \xa0 \xa0 1:40:02 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:40:04 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0So that’s where my heart’s going. Yeah. That’s where God’s leading me to go. \xa0 \xa0 1:40:08 Ashley James:\xa0MomsHouseForChildren.org? \xa0 \xa0 1:40:11 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. \xa0 \xa0 1:40:12 Ashley James:\xa0So M-O-M-S,\xa0MomsHouseForChildren.org. \xa0 \xa0 1:40:16 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yeah, I’ll send you the link. \xa0 \xa0 1:40:18 Ashley James:\xa0The link to that will be in the show notes of today’s podcast at\xa0LearnTrueHealth.com\xa0as well as everything that Theresa does. Now, you are launching a new mentorship program, mastermind program and it is divinely inspired. I know you are so excited about it. Can you tell us more about this program? And what we’ll learn from it? \xa0 \xa0 1:40:43 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes, absolutely. So this came to me about a week and a half ago. And I said, yes, it’s one of those things, you know, like, two days before I go on to the Amazon, I said, Yes. So when the spirit moves you, I surrender. And I said, I said yes to this because I didn’t really plan on doing this right now. Because I know the time the energy and the effort that it takes to put together something like this. But yet, when you’re really operating from that soul driven place, and the spirits working through you, it becomes less effort, you know, and it becomes easier for us. And there’s a lot more grace, and I’m not worried about it. So it’s only for 20. It’s 20 other souls that want to go on this journey with me through the rest of the year. So that 2020 because we know with creation, with manifestation, we have to clear up the vibration. And we have to do things to set in motion what we desire to experience. And so that’s when it came to me, it’s like now’s the time, we’re not just ending a year, we’re ending a decade. And 2020, I believe is going to be a year of great expansion for many of us, and a great transformation. And so helping others through the spirit working through me will guide you through teach people how to cleanse their vibration, how to reconnect to your deepest part of your own spiritual gifts, to amplify your own gifts, how to become the healer of your own life, all of these things, including your money story, your relationship story, all of that. How to really align into that place of surrender, so that the spirit can work more profoundly in your life, right and bring you… The thing about South Africa, it blows me away, there’s not a day that doesn’t go by that I don’t have a new connection, or I read something or like, I’m not even thinking about it. Now, somebody will invite me to a party, and there’s a bunch of South Africans there. I mean, it happens all the time. And we just smile, and I say thank you. And that’s the kind of level of creation I would like for the students to have in their own life. Now, this is not for beginners, person on this spiritual opening process, these are going to be more advanced teaching. So what happens is, you click on the link, and it’ll take you to a very short application process of about six questions, and it’s yes or no. And then you and I spend 20 minutes on the phone. So this is going to happen over the course of the next 13 days or something. And then we decide if now’s the right time for you, and the spirit is going to guide me into it being yes or no. So I believe that most people that are going to go through this process, it is yes, because I believe that we are magnets to our experience, right. And I’ve already prayed for those 20 that would come and it would be the right time. But it’s just good to feel each other out. And then we get you set up to start on the 24th of September. Now, these are going to be Zoom calls. And there are a ton of bonuses, which we lay out that so it’s going to be so much offering here, I am just really honored to be in a position to be able to bring in other experts, and also offer some of the other healing things that I’ve been taught to do over the last three years. And all of that is going to be between the 24th and the end of December so that we all emerge 2020 a better, more awakened version of ourselves. \xa0 \xa0 1:44:19 Ashley James:\xa0Beautiful, I’m very excited for you and for your students. I love it. You were telling me a bit about one of the lessons in it is going to be about acknowledging the ego and and helping it have more of you know, having healthy boundaries through ego I guess is the best way to do it. Because when we let our ego kind of run our life, it’s like I don’t know, for those who have had a toddler, they have no boundaries, and they will not respect yours. Right? And if you don’t know how to enforce them, they won’t respect any boundaries. So, we ere at my father in law’s 78th birthday dinner last night at a nice restaurant, and my son decides that he’s going to wash his hands in his glass of water. You know. So no, there’s no boundaries. But your ego is much like your toddler, your inner toddler, and that it will cross over and take over everything if we don’t kind of enforce our own boundaries with our ego, right? So you’re talking a bit about that with me and how one of the things that people are going to learn with you in this mastermind is how to do that. And then another thing you told me about is that when you were on your Ayahuasca journey, you saw energy, you had an experience where you saw the vibration of the jungle and the vibration, you got to see energy and feel it, you had that experience of not only feeling energy, but seeing it and experiencing a whole new level. And so you took lessons away from the jungle, and you’re incorporating that into your mastermind. Is there anything that you’d like to teach today to the listeners that you’re going to be including in your mastermind, anything, any kind of lessons that you’d like to… homework or lessons or teachings that you’d like to give to listeners? So they can maybe walk away with something to work on today? \xa0 \xa0 1:46:35 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Sure, first I’ll address the ego questions. So you know, the ego is here for a reason. And we actually created it as a human collective long time ago. So it’s here, and it’s here to stay because we’re in the physical body. There are a lot of good things that the ego does for us, like trigger fear whenever we’re in a dark alley, and there’s an element there that we don’t want to interact with, right? So there are some components that we absolutely utilize this for our benefit of the ego. Having a sense of pride in your being, that is an ego driven thing to a certain degree, right? When you couple that with being all that you can be that God created you to be, they have those kinds of things work hand in hand. Now where the ego drops our vibration is through judgment, it is through fear of judgment, fear of lack, fear of not being good enough, worry, old limiting beliefs about who you really are, judgment on other people’s behaviors, all of that, that is where from a spiritual component, it drops you down. Okay, so learning the voice of the ego, and why don’t we just curtail this into the homework or the assignment or, you know, an intention for the listeners, which is to learn to be the observer of when your ego is triggered based upon fear and judgment, because fear and judgment are what keep us from that soul alignment. They keep us out of compassion, they keep us out of forgiveness, which keeps us out of that unconditional love, that we are to be and as an expression of. And so when we’re judging, even when it seems like it’s something so terrible, you know, and we want to judge that person, “Oh they are just rotten to the core.” Or whatever. We are projecting that judgment. And in that moment that we judge another, that means that we judge ourselves, number one, so we automatically have, we know that we have shame, guilt, all of that still stuck in our vibration, right? It also removes you, you also step out of that soul alignment of the vibration of love that God is. And that really we’re an extension of, and so ever so briefly, we’re away from that. And we actually can feel the effects of that, you will feel, maybe you were happy before that. Maybe you felt expansive before that, maybe you were in joy, and you were in the moment, and you felt at peace. And then the minute judgment came in, even for yourself, oh my gosh, I shouldn’t be doing this, I should be doing that. And even if it looks that it might be more productive, but you’re judging yourself, and I don’t mean like for the better. Like, let’s say you’re doing something creative, and you’re playing or whatever, right. And there’s this voice that’s like, you better not be enjoying that, you better go work on your finances. So, or, you know, you’re trying to pray and meditate, and you get the thing, oh, change the laundry over. When you work from home, those are easy distractions. So it’s subtle, it’s subtle, sometimes sometimes they’re big, but oftentimes, they’re subtle. \xa0 And by being the observer of the difference between when you’re operating from the mind of God and when you’re operating from the ego mind, and the difference between them. Which is not an easy thing to do, because the ego will try to confuse that. But just if you take a global perspective, as you know, we’re both on NLP people, right? That global perspective, you will be able to decipher when you’re operating from the ego and when you’re operating from all that is, and the truth of who you are. You know, when you want to pick up the phone and make an important phone call, like I’m going to be doing here soon for somebody to be on my board of directors. And there’s a part of me that, or sending out emails for some big donations. And there’s part of me that’s like, “Yeah, but our 501 C3\xa0 is pending. It’s not done yet.” And I have all these reasons. Well, what is that? That’s not the truth. The truth is that all things are possible. The truth is I’m an extension of divine love and unconditional love. And so I’m going into it feeling like oh, my little organization or me or whatever is not good enough. Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:51:18 Ashley James:\xa0Who am I to do this? I’m just this little, tiny person, who am I to be big and brilliant and bold? \xa0 \xa0 Theresa Vigarino\xa0 1:51:25:\xa0Yes. Yes. And I’m faced with it all the time. And like I told you early on about my husband, who’s dealing with all of these very high level tech people in the world, right? And he’s putting on there about my masterclass series, which is going to have a lot of all focus on energy and spirit. And he’s ready to emerge that for himself, too. So we all come to a place where it’s like, “Oh, really?” Yeah. And the quiet confines of your own mind and in your own little comfort zone in your cocoon of safety. You’re saying, “Yeah, I’m going to do this. And I’m going to do that. And I’m going to put it out there because the spirit is moving through me.” Oh, yeah, let’s do it. The spirit is saying do it, then. Now’s the time. What you waiting for? Nothing to fear. And so when those resistance is happen, then oftentimes, it is the ego going, “Oh, yeah. But what if you’re going to lose more friends?” “What if it’s going to flop?” What if, this was a big one for me. “What if you’re going to get sick during that commitment?” \xa0 \xa0 1:52:40 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:52:43 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0You know, what if you’re not spending enough time on making more money, right? But the big one more for me was, you know, what if, what if people aren’t going to like you as much? What if they’re going to laugh at you? That was a big one that I used to get. And still a little bit you know, what if someone so laughs about ? What if you’re made fun of? Right? So I think we’ve all been made fun of when we were little, and I was made fun of a lot. I was a real heavy kid. And you know, that’s an old thing, right? So the ego goes what if they’re going to make fun of you. I was the girl that never got picked for the kickball team or anything athletic because I was the chunky monkey. And, you know, I ended up being the most outstanding female athlete one year later in the school. Take that kickball captain leaders, no, no I’m just kidding. It’s kind of funny now when I look back on it, but you know, and that is a muscle that I can access too by the way. Hey, wait a minute, people laughed at me before. That wasn’t the truth of who I was, who I am. And really, we know now from a higher perspective when people are laughing at somebody else, when people are making fun of you or people leave you because of something that your soul is driving you to do and aching and longing for and that is where your personal fulfillment is. The rest of it doesn’t even matter. And again, the light in you upsetting the non light we can say around you is a good thing. \xa0 \xa0 1:54:27 Ashley James:\xa0Sometimes we create those situations to test our resolve. In the Tarot, it’s the archetype the devil, the devil card is the archetype. It’s not the actual devil from Christianity. It’s an archetype of us testing our own resolve. And so, someone says, I don’t know, I’m going to quit smoking cigarettes and five minutes later, as you know, someone walks by and lights a cigarette in front of us. You know, it’s testing our resolve, or, you know, if you said I’m going to go do this charity, and then that little voice goes, that gives you a million reasons and excuses not to, and sometimes it looks like, sometimes people go well, how can it be me testing my resolve when it’s external things like someone saying or laughing at me, right? It’s external. But it’s how we react to it. You might have someone laugh at you every day. And you never even noticed, never noticed, your brain just deleted, generalize, said it doesn’t matter. It’s information that doesn’t, it doesn’t even matter. But the one day you go to do something new, it’s this little part in ourselves that wants to test our resolve. And so then the brain because the brain generalizes so much information. And the reticular activating system of the brain goes all right now you’re looking for people laughing at you. \xa0 \xa0 1:56:01 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Absolutely. \xa0 \xa0 1:56:06 Ashley James:\xa0So, we test our resolve, when we go to push outside of our boundaries and it’s uncomfortable, right, but so we got to take on like if we’re deciding to like for a friend of mine, who’s a listener, she has taken on the diet, the whole food plant based, no salt, sugar oil diet to heal her body in hurt because it’s the most restorative diet for her heart health, the cardiologist, Dr. Esselstyn I’ve had on the show, he’s in his 80s, and he’s still an active cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic and he heals, like four blockages in the heart with this diet alone, like unbelievable results. \xa0 \xa0 1:56:49 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0I absolutely believe in it. \xa0 \xa0 1:56:51 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. And so she started the diet. And now it’s every naysayers come up to to challenge her, you know, her parents, her husband, friends, coworkers, everyone is kind of like coming out of the woodwork to test her resolve. \xa0 \xa0 1:57:10 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes. \xa0 \xa0 1:57:11 Ashley James:\xa0And we and it’s how we perceive that conflict, will we give up and give in and kind of settled back down into status quo, or will be rise above it? And so I feel that sometimes that that challenge that we face, where we are seeing either external or internal, it’s our own little voice, like the ego saying, but this and but this, what about this? And if it’s external people, like you’re losing friends over it, whatever, whether it’s internal or external, when there’s a push to that it would be more comfortable to go back to status quo, it actually wouldn’t, because living a status quo is living in purgatory, we’re not evolving as a person. And so when we go, “Bring it on, bring it on world, bring it on.” You want to bring on conflict, okay. Bring on my parents challenging my diet, and my kids and my husband. Bring it on, because I am sticking to my guns, this is how I’m going to heal my body. And there’s no external or internal conflict that’s going to make me go back to status quo, because I’m going to go over this mountain. And help propel us further because the testing of our resolve actually makes us stronger in our resolve. So it’s that we have to have that 30,000 foot view, where we get that the things that we think are bogging us down are actually helping launch us forward. \xa0 \xa0 1:58:47 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0It’s really changing that perspective, isn’t it? It is really about perspective. And I love what you said about that. I’m going to employ that more in my life. So thank you, Ashley. I love that viewpoint because it is the truth. \xa0 \xa0 1:59:03 Ashley James:\xa0Right, I do this course as you know, where I teach people how to eliminate anxiety and part of the course is I teach them to get excited when anxiety comes up. Because they’ve spent years being afraid of it. And when anxiety comes up, it starts in the mind. But then ends up physically in the body when we’re physically feeling symptoms. Our hands are shaking. When we were dizzy, we’re about to pass out, we feel like yeah, die, you know, the body is perceiving a threat and we’re having a huge adrenaline response. So, cortisol is going through the roof. And the body is really having a physical reaction. So they’re afraid of it. So the second we start to feel anxiety, they then have a huge fear response, because they’re afraid they’re going to go into that. So then they’re resisting it. And as you know, everything we resist then we’re not able to… Yeah it gets stronger. We’re not out to actually face it and rise above it. And so I teach in my course to get really excited once they’ve learned the tools because I have the few tools I teach them that immediately eliminate anxiety in the moment, it takes about 30 seconds, and it completely shuts off anxiety. So once they learn the tool, then every time anxiety comes up in their life, instead of getting fearful because of all the past triggers, and worried that their body is going to go through a panic attack, they get excited, because it’s like, “Oh, awesome. It’s another opportunity for me to practice this technique.” And every time we practice it, it goes deeper into neurology, it rewires the brain even better. And so if we could get excited about when conflict comes up in our life especially conflict that is testing our resolve, if we could get excited, like, “Oh, awesome. Another friend is challenging me on my belief system. This is great.” Or another friend or a person is challenging my new health goals or my diet or whatever, or whatever we’ve decided, right? Whenever an external or internal, if there’s like, you know, the ego saying, what about this? Or you’re not good enough? How could you do that? Whatever, we get excited, instead of frustrated, we get excited, because anytime we’re being challenged internally or externally to test our resolve, it when we stick to our resolve, it will make it stronger, and it’ll help us to propel us forward. So that’s that was my little… \xa0 2:01:43 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0And then there’s a tipping point, right? Where that doesn’t show up in your reality. \xa0 \xa0 2:01:46 Ashley James:\xa0Right. Exactly. It’s at the beginning. It’s right out beginning. The testing of the resolve happens at the beginning. And then you enforce your boundaries enough with yourself and with others and eventually everyone gets it, your brain gets it. Everyone, your in it gets it. You know, now, like I’ve been gluten free for eight, nine years now, there’s no one that’s going to talk me out of it, and I don’t care. You can roll your eyes all you want when we’re at a restaurant together, you know, whoever I’m with, right? And it’s like, I’m not going to waver. But when I first started being gluten free, it’s like, oh, you know, oh, I don’t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. Well, not me. But other people. Other people go through that when they go gluten free. And so I’m not. \xa0 \xa0 2:02:35 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Or vegan, You go to your friends house and not eat their BBQ and just eat the salad. Trust me, I’ve been through that, too. \xa0 \xa0 2:02:42 Ashley James:\xa0Well, my husband and I are plant based now. And so, but I’m not going to apologize for who I am. I’m almost 40 By the way, and I really had an epiphany that I am not going to apologize for who I am. \xa0 \xa0 2:02:58 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Good for you. I am what I am.\xa0 That’s what I always say, right? Like it or not, I am what I am. And when people don’t like it, it’s okay. It’s their choice, right? But that doesn’t have to affect us. And what we know is what’s in our best and highest good. \xa0 \xa0 2:03:13 Ashley James:\xa0We gotta stick to it. And it’s lonely. Yeah, it will be lonely. When we make a new commitment. It is lonely, because sometimes we don’t have that support. Sometimes even internally, we don’t have the support. \xa0 \xa0 2:03:26 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Oh my gosh, absolutely. \xa0 \xa0 2:03:28 Ashley James:\xa0We gotta stick to it. And the more we stick to it, the stronger it becomes. And then we get to propel ourselves forward. So I love that you have an awesome journey the last two years and\xa0 you’re taking everything that you’ve learned, and that you’re incorporating. And now you’ve been a coach for years. You told me I talked the other day, you said you know something to the effect of you don’t identify as a coach anymore, you’re a healer. You really get that you’re a healer, but that you’ve been a coach for many years, and that you help people, for many years you’ve helped people, coach them to get to that place in their life that they want to be. \xa0 \xa0 2:04:08 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes, absolutely. And it really did come with the jungle experience that I really am more of a conduit and why I am a conduit, and it’s the messages come through. And the spirit comes through and the healing comes through. And so I had to really differentiate, because as I kept calling myself coach, I wasn’t really accessing what I’m here for, actually. And it was a stepping stone and I loved coaching. And it was really wonderful. It’s just different now and it’s coming more from this, it comes through me, not from me, if that makes sense. And so I’ve just surrendered to it. And the more of the surrendering process, which we will talk a lot about during this masterclass series, the more we’re in the vibration of surrender, the more powerful the healing comes through, the messages come through, your life unfolds, like the South Africa thing, you know what I mean? Like, everywhere I go, I thought I mean, it’s just unbelievable. My husband, we just look at each other, and just this amazement about how much South Africa is in our reality. And so when we are in that place of surrender, and we trust, we move into a state of trust through that surrender, then we are able to really let go and quiet that ego and live more in the realm of faith, that all things are well, that everything is working for your good. And you can rest in that and you actually quiet the mind down, the parasympathetic nervous system quiets down, and you have that state of peace. Even just for a little bit until you got to go through the process again, until it becomes your natural way of being. And then you’ll get triggered. And we’re always, because of free will. And we’re not robots, we always have that choice to make. And I, of course I’m a believer in prayer and intention, and meditation, and we incorporate that in our daily lives to help us stay in that vibration. And there’s lots of other things that will go through in the masterclass series for there to be visceral techniques, right? Visceral techniques, and then you know, I will, of course, be doing a lot of work ahead of time before each class. And that’s why it’s going to be small, because every person along with the class gets what’s called the soul alchemy deep healing session with me, which is a transformational, it takes about three days. And that in and of itself is like $1,000 normally, and that is a bonus. And that has been transformational for a lot of people. And it’s a shocker balancing a crystalline body upgrade. It’s all very etheric and energetic healing that takes place in the other realm that you will feel the effects of instantly. It’s amazing what happens after those and, you know, I’m going to do that for you, Ashley. \xa0 2:07:10 Ashley James:\xa0Oh, I’d love that. I’m all about it. \xa0 \xa0 2:07:16 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Yes, I know you are, I know you are. And, I just thank you so much for having me on, so that I can share this experience and encourage others that maybe have a chronic illness that, you know, my husband really has had a panic disorder. I don’t know if I shared that with you. Ashley, we didn’t realize that that’s what it was until the jungle, and he would be great for you to talk to about this anxiety, and what he learned, you know, and it was a download that he learned from the family and maybe even genetic and the reason why he went for the month and what he learned as a result of it, and how to be that energy. Yeah, so I’ll connect the two of you. But in the meantime, you know, I just want everyone to know that you’re doing better than you think you are. And that you are a unique and divine personal on purpose, being of light that is here to express the divine through your life. \xa0 2:08:19 Ashley James:\xa0Beautiful, thank you so much. \xa0 \xa0 2:08:21 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0End of Story. \xa0 \xa0 2:08:23 Ashley James:\xa0For now. To be continued. \xa0 \xa0 2:08:27 Theresa Vigarino:\xa0Thank you so much. I just love you. I love what you’re doing, your podcast is amazing. You’re an awesome interviewer and I love that you’re helping people through what they’re going through. And anxiety, like I said, it’s a big deal here in America. And, you know, kudos to you, Ashley for being a voice. \xa0 \xa0 2:08:44 Ashley James:\xa0Awesome. And likewise, thank you so much, Theresa Vigarino for coming on the show.

Find out on today’s podcast how-to’s as Dr. Kelly Brogan talks about her new book. \xa0 [00:00] Ashley James:\xa0Hello, True Health seekers and welcome to another exciting episode of Learn True Health podcast. I’m really excited for you to hear today’s interview. Dr. Kelly Brogan blew my mind. You’re going to love listening to her story of healing. She was an MD who was used to prescribing drugs to every single patient knowing that she was doing a lot of really good into their lives until she had Hashimoto’s. She became sick and she thought to herself, “I don’t want to be on drugs for the rest of my life.” This is what stared her journey over 10 years ago and then working with natural medicine she healed her body and has gone on to help her patients do the same thing. She goes on through her story and she teaches us some wonderful principles today. Emotional, mental, spiritual, excellent lessons that we can all learn. As I was interviewing her I’m like, “Oh my gosh, that’s a writer downer.” I’m so glad we transcribe these episodes now so you can go to\xa0learntruehealth.com\xa0in a week or two when we have these up on the site totally transcribed. Because you’re probably going to want to read through some things she say. The things that she says are so profound. So I know you’re going to really enjoy today’s interview but before we got started, I definitely want\xa0 to take a minute to introduce you to one of my nearest and dearest friends, I just want to say Dr. Jennifer Saltzman. That’s so funny I always do that. \xa0 \xa0 [01:26] Dr. Jennifer Saltzman:\xa0What’s it going to be until I find another way. [Laughter] \xa0 \xa0 [01:3] Ashley James:\xa0Right. Exactly. Well, so Jen Saltzman. I’ve had her on the show twice before. Sort of. Because you interviewed me and I interviewed you. Two episodes. Listener’s definitely want to go back and listen. What numbers were that? \xa0 \xa0 [01:44] Dr. Jennifer Saltzman:\xa0179 and 180 is my interviewing of you and then gosh, I’m going to say, 33 was one you did with me on maybe, supplement confusion? \xa0 \xa0 [01:54] Ashley James:\xa0Way back in the day. \xa0 \xa0 [01:55] Dr. Jennifer Saltzman:\xa0Early like 19 for you where you interviewed me in two episodes but I can’t remember the night off the top of my head, I can’t remember the numbers. \xa0 \xa0 [02:02] Ashley James:\xa0Cool. We’ll make sure that we’ll link. You’ve been on the show more – why didn’t I think twice? Gees, you’ve been in the show like a bunch. \xa0 \xa0 [02:08] Dr. Jennifer Saltzman:\xa0Because you forgot about ancient history when you first started. \xa0 \xa0 [02:11] Ashley James:\xa0Right. Exactly, the early days. Well, so most of the episodes are on iTunes but the last 80 or so episodes have been bummed off because iTunes have a max of 300 and of course, this is episode 378. Listeners can go to\xa0learntruehealth.com\xa0and check out the earlier episodes, which are there. I’m going to make sure they’re on the show notes of today’s podcast. All the episodes where Jen was with me on the show is linked. She’s taught Pilates for over 20 years. Was a dancer and in the last 10 years or so, has been an expert on health coaching and supplementation. Jen and I were close together. She is the driving force behind\xa0takeyoursupplements.com. You guys keep hearing me talk about it. When you go to\xa0takeyoursupplements.com\xa0and you put in your name, email address and phone number, the person you hear from about within 24hours is Jennifer Saltzman. I wanted to introduce you guys. She’s amazing. She’s so loving, so compassionate and she will talk to you and help you to figure out exactly what supplements are right for you and help you to dial in exactly what you need within your budget but Jen, I just wanted to introduce to all the listeners. All the new ones who don’t know who you are because they should know how amazing you are so if you just want to say hi with them and let them know what it’s like working with you at\xa0takeyoursupplements.com. \xa0 [03:33] Dr. Jennifer Saltzman:\xa0Sure. Hi everybody out there! I’m just so incredibly grateful that I know all of you because I talk to many of you. Absolutely adore Ashley’s podcast, I get so much amazing feedback. It’s such a blessing to have this forum where the information is getting out there and I know how grateful you all are to have this. It’s such an honor to be together with Ashley and her wonderful husband Duffy here in the studio. I just wanted to say that when I work with people with the supplement program. We have the need for certain basic nutrition that we absolutely have to have. If we don’t have it I kind of equate it with drinking water and eating good food and things like that. It’s never going to be like you have\xa0 do this. We work really individually with folks to figure out what their budget is, what’s going on with their health profile and we have lots of great options. I just want to take a moment and say that when I work with people, it’s a very supportive, nurturing kind of a post process together. We figure out what’s going on with people, we do a brief free health evaluation and we move forward in what seems to be – I give my two cents as well but it’s partnership that I work with people together to I achieve their goals and to work with what kind of budget they’ve got going on. Anyway, I just adore having this relationship with Ashley and being a part of this podcast in some small way that I am. I know both she and I have amazing health recovery with the supplements that we work with and so it’s such a blessing. Anyway, it’s an honor to be here. \xa0 [05:15] Ashley James:\xa0And if you’re interested in taking some high quality supplements that are affordable prices or if you’re a health coach, and you’re looking to incorporate supplements into your business, Jen can actually mentor you as well in that. \xa0 [05:30] Dr. Jennifer Saltzman:\xa0 Right. Yes. I’ll just say a brief moment a word about that. A lot of the people that I do work with they’re very passionate in this mission as well and they’ve of course been avid listeners to the podcast. I would say at least a third of the people that I talked to expressed an interest of wanting to help other people with this information. Maybe they’re already sharing the podcast, I’m sure they are and doing a lot of other things. We also train people in a very simple fashion. It doesn’t take years or anything, it’s just as simple we train people and coach them to be able to help their friends and family or their sphere of influence with this knowledge of the essentialness of certain nutrition. I do a monthly training. There’s lots of different training that I do. Anyway, there’s a lot of opportunity to get involved in a small level or large level. Whether it’s just a passion to help others or whether somebody’s looking to change what they’re doing with their time and energy. Figuring out how to generate income in a different kind of way. There’s lots of opportunities to basically be a part of a bigger mission. It’s the way I’d like to look at it. \xa0 [06:33] Ashley James:\xa0Well, yes since about 20% of my listeners are holistic health experts and many of them are health coaches or work on that kind of level. I know that they are very interested of having that tool in that tool belt. You give away so much of your resources of your time and training and you are so passionate to continue to spread this information and help people on that level. I love the liquid minerals. It’s probably my favorite thing. The liquid minerals are so bio available. For listeners who don’t know my story, these supplements helped me reverse polycystic ovarian syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and chronic adrenal fatigue. I was told I’d never have kids and I was infertile. Of course, through the diet changes and through the supplements, I was able to reverse that and conceive my very healthy 4 and a half year old boy who’s 4 and a half going on 40. Yes, thank you so much, Jen for coming here. Jen’s been staying over. She lives in the middle of nowhere Washington. The state of gorgeous Washington but in the moment she came over to stay here for a few days and since I was recording a podcast, I said jump on the mic and say hi to everyone. Thanks, Jen for saying hi. \xa0 [07:47] Dr. Jennifer Saltzman:\xa0My pleasure. Yes. \xa0 [07:47] Ashley James:\xa0 It’s been great having you here. She just got out of the sunlighten sauna. Did you like that? \xa0 [07:51] Dr. Jennifer Saltzman:\xa0Yes, I did. I just got out the sunlighten sauna. I had the fabulous Ashley James magic stew. I’m drinking the liquid mineral magic. \xa0 [08:01] Ashley James:\xa0Right now, you’ve soaked in magnesium. I’m going to get you to do a platinum – \xa0 [08:05] Dr. Jennifer Saltzman:\xa0I’m taking some energy bits – \xa0 [08:08] Ashley James:\xa0 Yes, I’ve got energy bits on the dust. Right? You’re going to do a platinum energy system foot detox soak later. This is like a spa day. \xa0 [08:15] Dr. Jennifer Saltzman:\xa0 Right. I’m at the Ashley James spa. [Laughter] \xa0 [08:21] Ashley James:\xa0Awesome. Well, thank you again Jen. Guys, I know you’re just going to love today’s interview. Thank you so much for being listener. Thank you so much for sharing this podcast with all those you care about. Today’s one of those episodes you’re going to want to share especially with all the mom friends out there because she says, Dr. Kelly says some things that just touched my heart and just made me want to get everyone to listen to this episode too. I know you’ll feel the same way. Excellent. Thank you so much and have yourself a fantastic rest of the day. Enjoy today’s episode. \xa0 [08:56] Ashley James:\xa0Welcome to the Learn True Health podcast. I’m your host, Ashley James. This is episode 378. I am so excited to have Dr. Kelly Brogan on the show today. Her website is\xa0kellybroganmd.com. She has wonderful books and a great book coming out, Own Yourself. Kelly, it is such a pleasure to have you here today. I love the work that you do. We here at Learn True Health are about empowering the listeners and you have an amazing ability to help women, and men and children because you’ve written a children’s book. Help all of us to be able to learn how to merge the spiritual with our physical health and our metal and emotional health. How to take care of ourselves on those levels. We’re not taught that in school. We’re not taught that in society. We really need to step it up and advocate for ourselves. You are going to help us do that today. Welcome to the show. \xa0 [10:01] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Thank you so much. What a beautiful introduction. I appreciate it. I’m grateful to be here.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 [10:06] Ashley James:\xa0Absolutely. Now, you wrote a book with your daughter, Sophia. A Time For Rain. That sounds amazing. What’s that book about? \xa0 \xa0 [10:17] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Yes. We were just sitting around one afternoon and it was super rainy out. This is when I lived in the northeast before I got out of jail and made it out to Miami. She always as a child loved to write books. She wrote a book called The Power of Me. I think she was three. Anyway, she used to love to write books. We put together this story. Honestly, it was one of those experiences where it just came through. I ended up self-publishing it because I couldn’t get a book deal with any of the major publishers. It’s essentially about the power of seemingly negative emotions and their role in the greater web of existence. The connection of all beings. I know that for me, the most powerful application of work in my life is in my role as a mother. Walking the walk of my work, in my role as a mother requires me to grow myself big enough to hold emotions that scare me. In this way as I grow that capacity I am able to show up to my daughter’s through love rather than needing to control their behavior so that it conforms to my very narrow band of comfort. Emotionally and so it’s really I think in service of helping parents to create that culture in the household. \xa0 [11:59] Ashley James:\xa0Everything you just said, I could spend an entire week on doing these on just like unpacking what you just said. Oh my gosh, it so resonates with me as a parent and needed to put my ego aside and what I think the world should look like and go, “Do I really need to force him, our son into this mold? Or can he be his own? Is that okay?” I had to constantly ask myself, “Am I disciplining him because this is what healthy for him to do? Or is this what I think am I stein fulling him?” I’m walking that line with you. I totally get it. Is A Time for Rain, children’s book or a book written for anyone? \xa0 [12:45] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 It’s actually a picture book. It’s like an eastern parable. Has that kind of a flavor. It’s obviously fictional. I’ve been told that by many people who read it it’s actually probably the most accessible story for adults that delivers home the message of the work we’ll talk about today. So I guess it’s for adults and children but it is a picture book. The illustrations are extraordinary. We partnered with his incredible artist. It’s very beautiful. \xa0 [13:19] Ashley James:\xa0 Very cool. How old is your daughter when she wrote it with you? \xa0 [13:23] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 She was eight. \xa0 [13:25] Ashley James:\xa0Oh my gosh, I have to get this book for my son who’s four and a half on going on 30. He’s already telling me how he’s going to have wife and raise his kids. It’s so funny. Telling me – \xa0 [13:36] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Take care of you. I love it. \xa0 [13:37] Ashley James:\xa0Yes, exactly. Well, he didn’t mentioned that. He said I’m not going to live with him. He’s four and a half. \xa0 [13:42] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 He’s habituating. You have to support that. \xa0 [13:45] Ashley James:\xa0[Laughter] Already? Yes. Now your next book was, or the book that you wrote on your own not with the help of your daughter was, A Mind of Your Own. Tell us a bit about that book. \xa0 [13:58] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 It’s interesting because we’ll talk about how I have a second book coming out now. The energetic signature of these books is so different. Even though one is essentially a sequel to the other. I wrote A Mind of Your Own in the years following my – I guess my intellectual physical, and physic awakening. So to speak. That was really triggered when I was diagnosed with Hashimosto’s thyroiditis, post-partum my first daughter. At that time, I was specialized as a psychiatrist in prescribing to pregnant and breastfeeding women. I was in this very niche specialty. Obviously, such a diehard believer in the pharmaceutical management model that I endeavored to prescribe to this very vulnerable population. You know, thought I was helping. Of course, right? The way we do. When we just follow directives without questioning them. I think this is very common experience probably many of your listeners have had this experience where you’re trained in the conventional fold. We really only question the foundation of our education when we bump up against the glass ceiling ourselves of what that paradigm has to offer. When I was diagnosed, this voice just kind of came up to me and I said, “I don’t want to take Synthroid for the rest of my life.” Meanwhile, I’ve been writhing prescriptions for years at that point and suddenly it wasn’t acceptable to me for me. So I ended up going to a naturopath which was so unlike me, so out of character at that point. That’s when you have to believe that there are moments that you’re guided beyond your executive functioning. \xa0I went to a naturopath. I saw on paper my antibodies go from the high 2,000s and a TSH of 20 into the normal range in black and white and all I had done was adjust some of my lifestyle choices. Because of my temperament, I didn’t say, “Oh that’s lovely.” and just keep on. I was enraged. I was enraged. I said, “How is it, I studied my ass of. I spent every Saturday for so many years on PubMed. I read every primary paper. I’m comfortable with statistics. How was it that I have never been taught that it’s possible to put an autoimmune condition into remission. I had one hour of nutrition education in my entire Ivy League training.” I was pretty pissed. At that time as the universe would have it, a colleague gave me a book called Anatomy of an Epidemic, which had come out around that time, by Robert Whitaker investigative journalist. I read it because I was already feeling dissonance around the body of knowledge that I had worked so hard to acquire so I was open to it. When I read it, it’s so condemned. Again, through non-industry published literature. So condemned my practice of psychiatry, as I had known it up until that point that I never started a patient on a prescription ever again to this day. That was almost 10 years ago.\xa0 \xa0 [17:28] Ashley James:\xa0Wow. \xa0 [17:30] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Yes. It had that level of impact. It was life changing obviously not only for me but for many who I’ve been able to support since then. I wrote A Mind of your Own from that righteous energy and I said, “I’m a believer in informed consent. Here’s what I’ve learned about not only psychiatric medications but actually many sacred cows in the pharmaceutical kind of warehouse. Whether it’s birth control of anti-biotic or acid blockers or statins. Over the counter painkillers or vaccines. I spent endless hours. Actually I calculated something over 10,000 hours just nearly obsessively researching everything I hadn’t been told with this fire in my gut about how it could be possible that I put this much into my training and just only learned a key hole version of the scientific reality that was available to me. I thought when folks read this book, no one’s ever going to touch your mediation again right because the information is there. How could they? Of course, I matured to recognize that that’s not actually how life works. That we actually don’t change our minds through information access. What I began to see was wow, this book and the testimonials that we are getting back from the book could also not be explained through information transmission alone. I couldn’t possibly reconcile some of the disease defying, medication eliminating outcomes that we were hearing about first hand from individual simply read that book. Something more to be going on here and that’s when I began to explore the role of mindset, belief and really a kind of metaphysical orientation towards reality that I believe under pins are experience of illness and our relationship to the nature of healing. \xa0 [19:37] Ashley James:\xa0I love it. So now, your book that’s coming out so soon that most listeners listening to this will be able to buy it. It’s written now on pre order but it’s coming out in the next a few days, listeners could just go buy it right now. Own Yourself is that empowerment tool out of your 10 years’ experience kind of on the other side, right? From allopathic medicine. I want to just go back to that moment when you realized you would never prescribe another drug again. Did you feel naked as a doctor? All of a sudden, your tool belt was taken away. \xa0 [20:15] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 That’s why I feel very spiritual supported and guided on my path because had I read that, had I just been an intellectually curious individual, I’ve always been a bibliophile. I’ve always loved books. Let’s say I read it but I hadn’t had about a year of my own healing journey under my belt, you better believe I would’ve immediately dismissed that information. The way that we do when we encounter information even through the rubric of science, that is inconvenient. It’s our natural tendency to dismiss it but I didn’t and I aligned with it because I had already seen that there was more to the story than I’ve been exposed to. I felt that. I felt that in my body. Anything from when I changed my diet, in an effort to heal my Hashimoto’s. I could feel, it wasn’t just about the numbers on the paper although it did helped instill this belief system in me but I could feel the difference in my body. I didn’t even know how much was off. I didn’t know that it wasn’t normal like poop once a week. These kinds of things had never occurred to me because I didn’t have any relationship to health or wellness. I only knew about disease and I knew I didn’t have any of them so, why do I care what I eat? Or that exercising, I’ve always been naturally thin so I had no motivation to do that. Meditating, that never occurred to me. I didn’t even think I even heard the word. The concept of perhaps there being risks associated with dying my hair black for so many years or using Secret deodorant or whatever might have been. I would’ve easily dismissed the relevance on each of those concerns as being vanishingly small but it was because I had a felt experience of how these lifestyle choices, my day to day selection of foods, how they can empower me to have an experience of my health that wasn’t even offered to me by the allopathic model. I believe that that simple kind of lived experience has the capacity to disrupt an entire paradigmatic mindset and invite you into one that is fundamentally more aligned with your truth. \xa0 [22:46] Ashley James:\xa0Absolutely. There you were, you’ve changed your diet. You’ve changed some lifestyle. Over how many months did it take you to work with a naturopath to go from full on Hashimoto’s to full on remission? \xa0 [23:01] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 About 8 months. \xa0 [23:04]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Okay. So in 8 months, you’re feeling better. Every month you’re starting to feel better. Almost on a daily basis, you’re noticing that the clouds are lifting. \xa0 [23:11] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 It happened within weeks. Clinically I felt better within weeks. \xa0 [23:17]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0 You really got the impact and it probably kept hitting you like, “I can’t believe it. I spent –“ however many years, you went to some major schools, you went to NYU Medical Center, MIT, Cornell. You have the best education and yet like you said, one hour of nutritional training and you didn’t know that pooping once a week isn’t normal because we give our bodies and give over our power to our primary care physician because we feel helpless. We believed that they know everything or our pediatricians. They know best for our child or our doctor knows best what’s for our body and their education is lacking. I mean their education is full of information but it’s not full of information to help us become the healthiest versions of ourselves. \xa0 [24:17] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 And you what? That’s okay. Right? I like to say you wouldn’t go into a butcher to learn about veganism. It’s absolutely okay that allopathic medicine is offering what it is from the belief system and mindset that it is. Right? Because the doctors live in this mindset. The doctors live in this mindset. In some way, everyone is served. The challenge arises when other paradigms are not allowed to co-exist. \xa0 [24:51]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Thank you. Yes. \xa0 [24:53] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Right? That when we get to the totalitarianism and even fascism of the dominant medical orthodoxy. \xa0 [25:02] Ashley James:\xa0That’s really well put. Because our rights are being challenged state by state when it comes to our choice. Some children are being medically kidnapped because parents want to choose a different treatment. I mean it’s really scary. We need to advocate that we need to have freedom. We need to have medical freedom to be able to choose the right course for us. I don’t believe any government should impose a medicine on someone who doesn’t want it. That’s really scary when we get into that. You’re here though to teach us about self-empowerment because you went through this 10 year journey. I would have freaked out if I had gone through your education and spent years helping people with prescriptions and having this experience and realizing that my tool belt is gone. The prescriptions are not really helping. What did you do to end up helping your patients? How did you shift your education? You shifted your mindset but how did you shift your tool box to be able to then help them? \xa0 [26:12] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 So it was an iterative process because I first decided that I was going to offer all of my patients based on the scientific literature, I’ve been exposed to Robert Whitaker’s work to the opportunity to taper of their medication. I’ve never been taught how to do this arguably there is not a psychiatrist on the planet today who has been taught how to do this. Right? If any psychiatrist or other prescribing clinicians are offering this service to their patients it’s because they taught themselves how to do it or they were taught as I was, by grassroots activists and patients themselves who have endeavored in this territory before I applied it to my practice. I offered my patients that opportunity and that’s when I learned and began to take a deeper dive into the – I Iearned about the dependency of inducing nature of psychiatric medications. I was essentially running an outpatient rehab center. My patients were becoming medically disabled at a rate that had me filling out disability forms beyond my capacity my pager was going off all the time. My entire quality of life shifted. This was before 2014 when it appeared in the medical literature that psychotropic medications when they are prescribed for longer than about 2 months have a capacity to induce some withdrawal phenomenon that can be protracted and complex. This is not just the Benzodiazepines or barbiturates, this is the anti-depressants, this is the so called mood stabilizers. This is the so-called anti-psychotics, right? It’s actually all of the categories, the stimulants. I had several years of witnessing that. It wasn’t until I foregrounded the basic lifestyle changes that through the scientific research I had done, I began to understand more ways to send the autonomic nervous system a profound and comprehensive 360 degree signal of safety. It wasn’t until I said, “No, this month comes first before we touch your medication.” That I began to have really robust outcomes. Then later in my process, I had the great privilege of working with the now late, Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez. Who, for those who aren’t familiar with his very important work, he’s one of the only clinicians in the world over who have 27 years of experience putting terminal cancers and degenerative illness into long term multi decade remission through a diet and detox based protocol. I was the only MD he ever mentored and the last year of his life, I had his eyes on my work and on my protocol. He offered me in addition to contextualizing the dietary approach that I take in about 12 different dietary options that are available, he helped me to understand that context but he also offered me the now and notorious coffee enemas which I have operationalized to extraordinary ends in my practice and online program but on my reset. It was because of him that I add that to the protocol and then I saw that medication tapers that are taking multi-year time frames dismissed to multi-month because of that single intervention in the way that he applied it, yes. \xa0 [30:08] Ashley James:\xa0He helped train you to then pass on the information to your patients about how to do healthy detoxes like using coffee enemas but also you mentioned 12 different dietary protocols. He helped you tweak those diets for detoxification? \xa0 [30:31] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Well, he used 12 different diets. Based on a system that was refined from his mentor William Kelly that derived from Weston Price and Pottinger and others that essentially based on leverages this understanding that we developed in such concept with the natural world that our nervous system adapt to the ecology. The temperature, the kinds of foods that are available. Now we are all on this big melting pot but then if you look at the eskimos versus the Amazonians vs the Incans vs the Swiss sheep hoarders, they all thrive on very different diets. There are people who are of these lineages not only ethnically but in terms of their also autonomic dominance, he would call it. He actually helped me understand why these very basic ancestral template that it had used in my own healing but that also worked in a little bit of a different way with my patients, why it worked and most confounding was how is it that the patients that I was working with were getting better with red meat inclusive diet. This was a bit before the paleo craze. I didn’t have the comfort of that labeling to fall back on necessarily but I did understand that the patients that I worked with in clinical practice and now see at scale in my online program that these are people who are uniquely suited on a nervous system level to heal on that kind of diet. He healed me to see that’s because they are most likely by enlarged what he called para sympathetic dominance. I go into this a little bit more in Own Yourself but simply it’s that these individuals have certain characteristics on a physical level like they’re susceptible to certain kind of cancers like liquid tumors, lymphoma or leukemia. They have a highly enervative pancreas so they are vulnerable to reactive hypoglycemia, those ups and downs of blood sugars throughout the day where they get hangry if they don’t eat within 4-6 hours but they wake up not hungry and they might wake up during the night, have sleep interruption because of that. They also have easy weight gain. He would say they look at the piece of toast and gain 5 pounds. That they have certain disease labels that come their way. Hypothyroidism, multiple chemical sensitivity, fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety. These were the folks who were often diagnosed with ADHD, allergies, asthmas and autoimmunity although obviously that becomes so ubiquitous I imagine he would say today that this spreads across the entire chart autoimmunity. That these folks character logically have things in common, that they tend to be night people, they tend to be free thinkers and artists like he would tell me that Picasso was undoubtedly one. They have tremendous capacity for new ones and outside of the box thinking relative to the sympathetic dominance who are more rigid lines and believers kinds of people. Like everything is kind of like, “Tell me the rules and I’m going to stay within them.” It helped me to see. Wow, that describes just about every patient I had ever seen. It helps me to understand why they would light up like a Christmas tree when I would say that they can eat red meat on this diet. I think some of them would come in thinking I was going to ask them to do a juice fast or a water fast or something and they would learn to the contrary, Nick would always say, “Patients would want to eat the diet that’s going to heal them. They desire it.” It has been my experience that we’re so clouded by so many addictive relationships to food and beverages that we don’t have a clear channel to our intuitive preferences. So my adaptation of his very nuance approach is to really start with a scalable template that controls obviously not only for inflammatory foods, including processed sugars etcetera and amplifies nutrient density but also allows you to experience addictive free eating so that you can really clear that channel and begin to understand your preferences. I remember when I engaged in this dietary change there were whole months where I would eat 15 radishes a day for like months or carry a cucumber everywhere I went. I mean this even now 10 years later I’ve been a broccoli robbed face where I eat probably eat 2 bushels of them a day. You start to get to and understanding that what you prefer is what you need. What you want is what you need. Well, you know within the parameters of whole foods. It’s actually super liberating. \xa0 [35:56] Ashley James:\xa0Yes. My first time doing a sugar fast like removing sugar totally from the diet. I could not believe that reset that happened. That sugar is in everything. It’s in everything. I couldn’t believe it. Then now, I’m whole foods plant-based and so I’ve been healing my relationship with food and on the show I’ve had lots of people on about over eating and emotional eating. There’s definitely an emotional component but there’s definitely physiological component too because when we start to eat hyper palatable foods with salt, sugar, and oil. anything that’s in fast food for example, it’s designed, they have scientists figuring out how to make the food more hyper palatable to excite the neuro toxins to excited the sorry, neuro chemicals to like excited the brain and the brain lights up like a Christmas tree like you’re on cocaine so that you enjoy it and you want more. It’s like going to a theme park for your mouth and your brain. It’s destroying the body in the process. When I went wholefoods plant-based it’s like going in a very small one percent experience like going off of heroin because I had to get off of the salt, sugar, oil, flour, hyper palatable foods. Foods that I wanted to over eat and foods that no matter how much I ate, like Chinese food for example. I could finish all the Chinese food and still want more. There’s no more left and I still want more. There’s no amount that would make me feel satisfied and do that’s enough times I got –it’s not, my body like it’s not healthy, my body isn’t actually thrive on this. There’s something if there’s a food that no matter what I can’t get enough of it, no matter what I eat it then I know that’s not healing food for me but like when I eat I made this vegetable stew I posted it on our Learn True Health Facebook group. I can’t believe how quickly It fills me up and satisfies me. Then I’m done. There’s no cravings. My body feels so it’s like buzzing with energy but not a bad buzz like a good buzz. My body feels calm. It totally turns in the parasympathetic for me it just gets me into that calm state. I’m not thinking about food. I’m not panicking about food. For me, I’m hearing what you’re saying because when we eat foods that our body loves like you said, two bushels of broccoli raw a day, like you probably feel full and comfortable and your body feels well. You’re not craving anymore, right? \xa0 [38:42] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Exactly. It part of the reclamation process. We just put out a quiz where you get your empowered. You can find out in a minute. There’s so many places in our lives where we have perhaps unconsciously given permission to an external entity or agent or person to hold the power that is ours to reclaim. I used the same example I remember when I used to live in Manhattan. I was in my training. I used to go to this pizza place on the corner as you do when you live in Manhattan. I would get two slices of pepperoni pizza put chili flakes I remember I could taste it in my mouth now. I would take one bite and I would literally be overcome by this feeling that I could eat 12,000 of those pieces of pizza. It’s actually a terrible feeling state to cope with because it’s you at war with you and there’s no winning. That’s why it was no surprise when I dove into the literature and I found okay, one method of quieting neuro inflammations to eliminate gluten and dairy. Is to eliminate the proteins gliadin and casein from your diet because they literally plug into opioid receptors in your brain. If you can detox which take sometimes about 10 days of almost going through something like a flu like experience depending on how much of those foods you were eating, I was eating all day 5 times a day probably bread and cheese. Once you’re through that window, it’s like you’re free. Now when I eat food it’s because I’m hungry ad I eat it, it tastes good, and the I move on with my life. \xa0 [40:40] Ashley James:\xa0Yes. It’s the freedom it’s given you. I had an interview on how addictive dairy is. It’s designed, nature’s intelligent. God, nature, universe is the intelligence is that we want the calf or the baby to suckle so milk from any mammal is addictive but milk from a cow is supposed to turn into a 60 pound calf into a 4 pound cow. So Why are we drinking something that’s supposed to make us balloon and become as a big as a cow which is think is hilarious. Yes, it’s addictive so people really fight about giving up their cheese. Cheese is just concentrated milk addiction. That was like the last thing for people to give up. I remember sitting on the weekends with my husband eating an entire brick of Tillamook cheese back in the day. We went gluten free and dairy free and it’s made world of difference and then we went on whole foods plant-based and it allowed clarity in my body. Like you said, it calms down that nervous system. It calms down that stress response and it’s amazing how much clarity I could work through emotions around food so much easier now that I have eliminated the foods that were keeping me in that excited state. I love that it’s part of your program. \xa0 [42:04] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0I couldn’t agree more. It’s interesting because I’m often asked, I have a bit of let’s say a strict it’s probably how mystically you’ll put it but a strict approach to this month long protocol. It’s a very yang energy that I bring to it. Words like, “Go big or go home.” Really OD it. Commit to it. Every single choice is consistent with your commitment. It’s one month of your life. You’re never going to do it again but do it right. So many people are like, “This can’t be appropriate with people who have eating disorders because they’re struggling with restriction often. This concept of deprivation being very triggering to them.” I sort of\xa0 marvel over the fact that about I would say about a 3rd\xa0of the women I’ve worked over the years have identified as having eating disorder previous to our work together. As you know, the convectional model when it comes to disordered eating is to basically inure the patient to processed foods meaning that this marker of success for eating disorder treatment is that you can eat a donut and not have to purge it. If you’re restricting that you can eat a piece of pizza and not feel terrible about having eating it or not feel out of control. It’s like you’re being forced to eat junk food. It’s amazing. I don’t know how many people are familiar with conventional treatment of eating disorders. It’s quite amazing like the way in conventional psychiatrist approach it’s considered a marker of success if you eat junk food and you’re okay with it. If you don’t know the science behind the ways these processed foods interact with the nervous and inflammatory systems, what a herculean task that is of a patient. It’s quite different healing modeled to set the conditions for eating to become simply about nourishment. Then whatever else it might be is something that you can cultivate when there’s consciousness around and self-compassionate around and curiosity. How interesting that when we finish this interview I might make myself a matcha feeling like I did my job and now I can relax. How interesting that is? Right? You begin to watch the ways we can infuse even healthy foods with a certain kind of energy around like the ways we self-domesticate. We keep ourselves in line and in order we give ourselves little treats and rewards but it’s something you can look at once that foundation is underfoot.\xa0 \xa0 [44:56] Ashley James:\xa0Yes. Exactly because the foundation is get the body to a place where it’s nutrified and the nervous system isn’t hyper excited from those foods that are designed to really mess with the brain. As you are talking, I was just imagining someone like going into a rehab clinic because they’ve been addicted to meth and part of the rehab is, “We’re going to give you small amounts of meth. You’re going to only take one hit off that meth pipe or however people do meth.” Or I don’t know. I don’t even know how people do meth. Basically, “Take one small hit and then you have to stop and not binge in that meth. That’s your rehab.” And it’s just like, “Really? It doesn’t make sense.” What we really want to do is come to that place where like you said, where the mindset is, we’re looking at nutrifying the body. We’re looking at what foods because everything that we put in our mouth build us up or tears us down. We’re either in anabolic state or catabolic state. You’re looking at food as someone’s medicine as someone’s drug. How it affects the brain and you’re the perfect doctor to do it. Having people manage their physical and emotional and mental health for so many years. Do you do 12 different diets depending on their circumstance? Can you explain that a little bit? \xa0 \xa0 [46:23] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Sure. I have one template which is the only template I’ve ever used for 10 years. I have decent amount of experience with it. What I found because when my mentor died, it was one of the greater spiritual crisis of my life. I thought, “Well, how am I supposed to proceed?” You know without his guidance and mentorship there’s so much more I could’ve learned and “How am I going to help my patients know which of the 12 diets is theirs?” I believed that the era of master-student even the doctor-patient is fast fading. That were coming into as I guessed around self–healing and self-authority, which is obviously the spirit of my new book. I have been shown that it really works. Right? It really works to take that approach. The template is meant to put you in touch with your own innate preferences. Then from there, you figure it out. I have guidelines obviously for how to do that but for the most part, it’s something that you figure out. No longer are you working within Kelly Brogan’s template, right now it’s your show. I found that the 30 days of very strict adherence and compliance work as something of a portal to that place of self-authority over nutrition and food. I will say that there – because I give permission around animal foods most of the folks who were helped by my protocol do prefer that. That can be an important indicator. I’m not saying for ethically because that’s a very complex variable here that I’m in no position to address. It’s not what I’m here to talk about. On a very kind of gut level, they do want to eat a steak. Whether they eat red meat twice a day or after the protocol they go on to eat to once a month or maybe never, is something that they determine in this self-tailoring process. Because there are other elements of the protocol that involve obviously detox and contemplative process or stress response healing. That also, I think co-conspire to create the conditions for you to be able to relate to your own body and dialogue with your body in a way that wasn’t available to you when you have brain fog and bloating, insomnia, your hair is falling out, your knee is hurting. All of the ways that our body says, “Hey, remember me? Can we please talk?” Those symptoms once they quiet down which often happens very quickly it just becomes so much easier to hear. \xa0 [49:29] Ashley James:\xa0This template, this guide, that’s in your book? The one that’s coming out, Own Yourself? \xa0 [49:36] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Yes. It’s in the A Mind of Your Own as well. That was the I guess one of the earlier iterations of it before we had scaled it in our online program which is I basically chug when I’m doing clinical practice. I put it online and thousands of people had tried it out. The outcomes that we have from there make it look like I’m doing something working in my private practice. It was actually very humbling on an ego level. For me to see like, “Okay, so the less contact that an individual has with me with the same instructions, the better?” literally, we’re just constantly in the publishing process. We just published remission of Graves’ disease through lifestyle choice in a per view index journal. We’re constantly writing up these cases because they’re so extraordinary. The case of that one paper it’s never been reported in the medical literature that’s just because nobody’s bothered to write it up obviously. It’s a pretty profound. What I’ve now taken input back into this book, Own Yourself, is the refined protocol and was finding out what’s my partner was saying the other night. He was reading the book and he was like, “Wow, you’re really giving away the goods in this book, huh?” You know, our program is a thousand dollar program. It’s for very special people I think. Who are called to heal the seemingly incurable. That’s the kind of person who’s attracted to the program. It’s a very important investment and it seems to work as designed. However, I also know that people can use this program and do it on their own because they did it with A Mind of Your Own and it was less refined then. So yes, I’ve decided to put the whole thing into the book and the copy odd being that I am a big believer that if you’re tapering off psych meds, you require community. Again, because I have done this one on one. I actually have just needed my one on one tapering practice after all these years to shift into a group model. That’s how much I know that it’s the proper way to do it. That there is a kind of existential isolation that can attend to the dark night of the soul which is what characterizes the tapering process. It’s a kind of painful awakening and the yield is extraordinary. These individuals I call them the canaries in the coal mine. They’re exquisitely sensitive people who’ve been capture by psychiatry and medicated and labeled. Learning how to work with that power, it’s like an initiation process. It’s not easy but what comes out the other side, now there’s so many of this individuals they work in this mission. They heal other people. They establish non-profit. It’s just extraordinary. I feel very strongly that that work is meant to be in community and so, the coffee enemas is really for that population in my application of the protocol and so that is reserved for the communities that we have but outside of that the entire rest of it is in there, yes \xa0 [52:59] Ashley James:\xa0Got it. Coffee enemas are not in the book? \xa0 [53:02] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 The Nick Gonzalez’ instructions are not in the book. To me that’s a very sacred offering. I’m the only person who’s ever been given that information aside from his associate, Linda Isaacs who practices still the protocol. For me, that’s for people who are up the level of dedication and I think it’s also because nobody’s coming to my protocol to treat their cancer. I don’t think. It’s really for people who are in the pharmaceutical detox realm. I don’t think they should be doing this on their own. I don’t think they need a doctor necessarily. I’m not suggesting that. It’s not that tagline like, “Please consult your medical professional.” It’s not that. I do believe that they must do it in a like-minded community honestly mine is one of the only one in the world. There are tons of other options. \xa0 [53:53] Ashley James:\xa0That’s wonderful. Anyone can get your book and benefit from it? Those who are on pharmaceutical medication for mental, emotional and want to detox off of it in the healthiest way possible and support the body and restoring itself to optimal health. Mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually and energetically. Do your online program because then they have that community, they get the full detox protocol. They have the ongoing support through you. Anyone can start with the book and then those who are called to, can do your online approach? \xa0 [54:34] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Yes. If that feels right. My last third of the book is really about navigating the awakening process. What I found is, I haven’t taken psychiatric medication myself but then my primary credential in writing this book is that I myself have encountered the dark night of the soul several times. Several turns around the spiral of my process. It looks the same. It looks the same as it does for these patients. These book obviously well, I like to think of myself as really being in the corner of those who are looking to reclaim themselves from chronic disease labels. I also know that there is an archetypal journey that those of us who are interested in healing our being called towards. I think it has more to do with adultification. This concept of I think some of us are just feeling like, “God, I’ve got to get stronger. I’ve got to level up. I’ve got to get it together.” We think that that means applying more control and force to our current circumstances but it can also mean and perhaps more accurately refers to this process of resolving childlike programs and impulses so that we can finally identify the locust of control within us. That’s where this idea we brought up earlier around bodily sovereignty. There’s a reason some people don’t believe in bodily sovereignty. There’s a reason that some people that the state for example should have control over whether medications are injected into our bodies against our will and it’s because they still believe that there is an external authority that is infallible. That knows best. That sounds a whole lot like the parent we never had, right? We parentify these institutions. We need them to be as good as we say they are because otherwise, our entire worldview falls apart and everything gets really scary. What I hope to create is a path to navigating this adultification process that helps to mitigate the emotional wreckage that can lead you running back up into the uterus from the birth canal. Right? It’s because we all go through the same stuff as our worldview crumbles and we encounter its deficiencies and its bankruptcy it’s terrifying. It’s absolutely terrifying. If we can grow our ability to be okay with not being okay, then we will whether it with grace and we’ll come out the other side living in a world where things are meaningful inherently. Nothing is fundamentally bad. Everything is interesting and we can bring curiosity where once there was only fear. It’s just a more beautiful way to live to be honest. \xa0 [57:52] Ashley James:\xa0So well put. I could listen to you all day. You’re so poetic. You get right to the point and you paint this picture that’s so beautiful. I bet your book is amazing to read. [Crosstalk] If it’s anything how like you talk it’s wonderful. \xa0 [58:09] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Well, it should be because is wrote it. \xa0 [58:10] Ashley James:\xa0There you go. I know you have to go really soon because you’re going to pick your kids up from school but I wanted to ask if you could give us some homework. You said before we hit record that there’s this world changing power of self-care and that’s part of the message that you teach. Can you give us some self-care homework? \xa0 [58:33] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Sure. Yes. Thank you for bringing that up because I imagine that some of the people listening either had encounters with psychiatry or know people that they love who have. In keeping with this identification as of those individuals as being fundamentally very sensitive to powerful emotional states and energies then odds are that they also feel very concerned about what’s going on with this planet. There’s so many potential points of advocacy. There’s so many things that feel out of alignment. That feel wrong. So many ways that we can contribute to different causes and it can induce somehow this paralysis that is very disconnecting. It feels like you’re then disconnected from others. You’re disconnected from your community, you’re disconnected from yourself. The resolution to that in these individuals I have found is as the Zen say, to simply chop wood, carry water. To make a sacred ritual out of caring for yourself, and putting yourself as your number one priority every day. I don’t necessarily mean as some like narcissistic exercise of getting what you want all the time. I mean as if you were your own baby, how would you care for this newborn baby? How would you look at her adoringly? How would you bathe her? How would you feed her? How would you create conditions for her relaxation? How would you give her experiences of pleasure and joy? This is what a radical act self-care can represent. The way that I institute apply and recommend self-care is about two and a half hours of your day. We’re going to be focused simply in caring for the organism that is you. It also involves other practices related to tending to our emotional selves. I can give maybe one example of each. In terms of self-care practice that gives a physical foundation. One of the very practical tools that I recommend is one that’s operationalized in my programs that we get love letters about everyday all day which is just changing your breakfast. I have a 30-day diet protocol. It’s deep dive. It’s no cheating all this but you can also just start your day with a mindful loving intention to what you’re eating for breakfast and it can change your experience of your entire day. My most popular recommendation is this smoothie. Recipe that I made up that tastes like chocolate milk basically. It’s not even a green smoothie or anything that you would typically expect. Probably part of the reason why it feels good is because it has a lot of natural fat in it and so many of the individuals who are attracted to this work have that reactive hypoglycemia. Self-care can look like that instead of grabbing a bar from your cabinet and running to your commute. It can also look like changing the way in which you reflectively respond to your own inner turmoil. \xa0In today’s vernacular, we’re calling it triggering. To begin to learn about the emotional and physical signature of your trigger. For me, when I am triggered meaning that somebody sets me off, either an email I get or a look I get across the room or something that my partner says or my daughter wanting to say something to me at a time when I’m working or whatever it is. I get this tightness in my chest, my heart might start to race a little bit and then I have this urgent feeling like I need to communicate my own defense. I need to engage my intellect to persuade whomever it is that I am right. I think it’s a pretty common signature but now when I have that feeling, that picture arises in my life, instead of just reflectively engaging in the other person as being the source of my problem, which is of course, natural right? We engage warfare. I have cultivate a practice and I have many examples of what that practice can look like in the book but I cultivated a practice of turning towards myself. It’s not necessarily to fix myself or to make myself feel better, it’s just to be with myself. Not abandon myself emotionally in those moments. It can look like anything from putting your arms around your waist and just sitting quietly for 30 seconds or it can look like a visualization exercise like one I had these for my patients for many years where you personify that feeling and that emotion that you’re having as being felt and experienced by a small same gendered child. You show up to that child who’s having this experience with very simple languaging. You say something like, “oh gosh so hard what you’re feeling, I’m so sorry. It’s totally okay.” And you say that kind of stuff to yourself and it sounds ridiculous and it sounds like, “How could that help? Who has the time for that? Whatever.” Trust me I have brought literally dozens of patients from the brink of suicide with this kind of a practice. It’s at once very self-compassionate and self-forgiving but moreover it’s a powerful way to cultivate what’s often called witness consciousness. Which it is that adult consciousness that allows you to watch what’s happening rather than getting sucked up into a childlike story about the good guy and the bad guy. The cultivation of this witness consciousness is the superpower. It’s ultimately what defines I think adult psychology which has the capacity to hold the good and the bad in every single scenario in every single person. The more individuals that we have entering into this state of consciousness the closer we will come to an experience of peace on this planet. I literally believe that. It starts with self-care. \xa0 [01:05:37] Ashley James:\xa0This is the path to peace on the planet. We can take 30 seconds when we’re triggered and practice self-compassion, self-forgiveness and have that witness consciousness to soothe that child inside us that just wants to wage war. Can you imagine if politicians did this? \xa0 [01:05:58] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 I know. They don’t have to because if enough of us do, the shift will happen. I really believe that and it doesn’t mean we would be writing our legislators and everything else but it’s resonant. It’s a resonant phenomenon. Again, remember I have a big mouth and I like to think that I’m right. I like to exercise that I’m on an intellectual level go out on all my studies and all this. I didn’t have the potential impact that I might have today, simply taking care of myself. Every time I get sucked up into an issue and I feel like, “This can’t be. This is wrong.” Whatever it is. I now know. “No Kelly, chop wood. Carry water. Did you go to dance class today? Did you eat breakfast? Maybe a different meditation this morning.” It’s literally on that level that I have the confidence that I will begin to attract others to this way of being. I do think we all have to be this way in order to create this more beautiful world experience that we can all inhabit. \xa0 [01:07:08] Ashley James:\xa0Kelly, you are so congruent and compassionate. I love that you are the example that we can learn from. That you have that compassion because you’ve also like you said you’ve had the dark night of the soul and you’re invulnerable in sharing and then teaching us an helping us. I’d love for all of us to be you when we grow up. [Laughter] \xa0 [01:07:35] Dr. Kelly Brogan:\xa0 Please. I don’t know about that.

He will also share with us the effects of heavy metal toxicity and its relation to ADHD, Parkinson’s, MS, and other neuro degenerative diseases. \xa0 0:00 Intro:\xa0Hello, true health seekers and welcome to another exciting episode of the Learn True Health podcast. You’re going to love today’s interview with Dr. Greg Eckel. He is a Naturopathic physician that specializes in helping people heal and support neurological conditions. We’re going to talk about Parkinson’s, ADHD, and how to support the body if someone’s experiencing any of these issues, or if you want to prevent, because prevention is the most important thing we can do. He goes through his functional program, and the things that you can start doing today to support your body’s ability to be the healthiest it can possibly be. Now, he mentions a few things. And I really want to make sure that you know about the things that I love that he sees great results working with his clients. So there’s three quick things I want to mention. \xa0 \xa0 0:58 Ashley James:\xa0One, he talks about the impact and importance of using saunas, if you have heavy metal toxicity, because you can sweat in a sauna to help the body remove fat soluble toxins instead of having to tax your liver and that can have a host of problems for people, especially if they already are bombarded with toxins. So, we have an environment that has created heavy metal toxicity in many people, and if you have any neurological conditions such as ADHD, depression, any kind of imbalance, or if you know that genetically in your family, a lot of people are predisposed to developing Parkinson’s or MS, you want to support a healthy brain by doing gentle detox through sauna therapy. You can go to my website\xa0www.learntruehealth.com, type in sauna. Listen to some of my interviews that we’ve done specifically around how to use sauna therapy and how to sweat to release these toxins in a gentle way. I got a Sunlighten Sauna almost two years ago and I have absolutely loved it. It’s played a big role in my personal healing journey. I really feel a difference. And using it has made such an impact on my life that I keep telling people about it. Sunlighten has given us a great deal. Give them a call and say that you are a listener of the Learn True Health podcast with Ashley James. And they always have a special for us, they give us free shipping and sometimes the shipping is $500, if you buy one of the wind saunas. Now, they do have a personal sauna that’s portable, that you can tuck away into your closet. We’re not using it and it is non toxic and ultra low EMF and you get results with it. So, you don’t have to worry about having enough space. I interviewed Dr. Mark Hyman on the show and he said that he lives in a small condo, he doesn’t have enough space for a big wooden sauna. And so he has their solo system and it works wonderfully. I do have the wooden one because we did have the space and I love the three in one sauna, which gives you all three frequencies. Many saunas only do far infrared, theirs does near and mid which gives you anti aging benefits as well, and pain and inflammation reducing benefits as well. So, check out Sunlighten Saunas, give them a call. Tell them you’re a listener of the Learn True Health podcast with Ashley James and ask about their specials on top of the free shipping. They usually have some kind of great deal in addition to that that they give us. I like it when they give $100 off their accessories because I love the non toxic bamboo pad for the wooden sauna that’s really comfortable. Excellent. So that was the first thing because he talks about the results he’s getting in his clinic with his patients using sauna therapy. The second one is\xa0Medterra CBD, I really recommend checking out\xa0Medterra CBD, they give the listeners a great discount as well use coupon code\xa0LTH. I interviewed the founder of Medterra CBD, there’s so many CBD companies out there and there’s only a handful that are organic that will publish their tests to prove that there’s no heavy metals, that their CBD is clean. And I’ve personally used many different types of CBDs and theirs I feel in terms of a tincture, in terms of that concentrated extract, I get the best results. So that’s\xa0Medterra CBD, use the coupon code\xa0LTH\xa0because they do give us a great discount. And you can go to\xa0www.learntruehealth.com, type in CBD to listen to that interview to learn more about their farming practices and how they make it, knowing that it is a very clean form of CBD. And it’s also guaranteed that there’s no THC. So if you do drug testing, you can know that and he does talk about that in our interview. And the third thing is the magnesium soak. And he also talks today, Dr. Eckel talks today about how important magnesium is for brain health. And know that you can soak in magnesium and gain the benefits without needing to take a supplement orally. Because many people have adverse reactions to taking an oral magnesium supplement. But when you soak in it, you can absorb grams of magnesium and get all the benefits in a very gentle way. So, listen to my interview with Kristen Bowen. I’ve done a few interviews with her, she was 78 pounds I believe and having 30 seizures a day. And soaking and magnesium was one of the most important things she did to get her health back. So, it absolutely helps with neurological conditions because the brain needs magnesium. Just like many other nutrients that Dr. Eckel talks about today. You can go to\xa0www.livingthegoodlifenaturally.com, that is the magnesium soak website,\xa0www.livingthegoodlifenaturally.com,\xa0click on the magnesium soak jug picture when it first comes up and then use the coupon code LTH as in Learn True Health. LTH gives you a discount, and then you can get that jug of magnesium. Come into the Learn True Health Facebook group. We’d love to see you there ,you can ask questions of the other listeners who have Sunlighten saunas, who’ve tried Medterra CBD or who use the magnesium soak. Many listeners are using all three and getting some great results. And Dr. Eckel shares that and many other suggestions today. So enjoy today’s show. Thank you so much for being a listener and have yourself a fantastic rest of your day. \xa0 \xa0 6:46 Ashley James:\xa0Welcome to the Learn true health podcast. I’m your host Ashley James. This is Episode 377. We are back from this summer. Labor Day just happened. I am super stoked to get back into interviewing. Listeners who are in our Facebook group were telling me that they’ve been jonesing, they missed the show and I took a little vacation for about a week and hung out with my son and my husband and we went swimming and got lots of sun and it was wonderful. But I couldn’t wait to come back and interview Dr. Greg Eckel who’s a Naturopathic physician in Portland, Oregon, he specializes in neurology. You are going to love today’s interview. I’m so excited to have Dr. Eckel here to share with us how we can prevent and reverse and support people who are experiencing Parkinson’s, MS and other neurological conditions like migraines, traumatic brain injuries, headaches, and even post stroke recovery. This is going to be exciting. Welcome to the show. \xa0 \xa0 7:56 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Thank you. \xa0 \xa0 7:57 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, absolutely. Well, I love dive in to learn a bit more about the doctor before the doctor starts teaching us about how we can better heal our bodies. Because understanding what happened in your life that led you to become the physician and the healer that you are allows us to understand the philosophy and the lens at which you look through life and in order to help us. So what happened in your life that made you want to become a Naturopathic physician? \xa0 \xa0 8:28 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Well, in the early 90s in Portland, Oregon, I was a preschool teacher. And I was watching at that point, I was in the Montessori education system. \xa0 \xa0 8:39 Ashley James:\xa0Nice. \xa0 \xa0 8:40 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0And it was the beginning of the attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, you know, onslaught and big pharma had discovered, “Hey, there’s this untapped market called children, let’s drug them.” And it was really disheartening. You know, I was an assistant in a classroom. I had my poster child was this boy, Michael, and he was definitely, he was rambunctious, I like to say, included others in his learning. And, you know, he was definitely wild guy out on the playground, in the classroom, you know, in the Montessori classroom you can choose your own material and bring it back to your desk. So Michael was always kind of in at other people’s tables. The head teacher advocated to the parents, “Hey, I think Michael has some attentional issues, I think you should go get them checked out.” They took them to the pediatrician. Lo and behold, they diagnosed him with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and then they medicated him with Ritalin. And the first day that he got back in the classroom, you know, definitely he’s slumped over in his chair. He definitely stayed put, he was in his chair and at his table, but that little light that shines shine in the eye was gone. And I just thought there’s got to be a better way to help these kids. And at that time, I also was a junk food vegetarian. And I wasn’t feeling very healthy. And a bunch of paths led me to the Naturopathic school where these people, these physicians, they treated my diet. And boy, it was it was like a light bulb went on. Like, “Wow, actually, if I went back to school, I wanted to be in service to people.” And so many different paths led me into Naturopathic medicine. So, not a day goes by that I’m not grateful for the for the experience. And I just thought I really got into helping kids with attentional issues when I started, but that’s really what took me there was that picture of Michael just being really just drugged and slumped over and saw the sparkle gone out of his eye. \xa0 10:57 Ashley James:\xa0So what happened to Michael, do they just keep dragging him? Or did they try… \xa0 \xa0 11:02 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. They just basically, you know, it would be great to follow up. I got into medical school, he was my poster child and motivation for going through, in addition to family members and other people with health issues. But what I discovered, I got into neurofeedback, and that’s kind of what led me into neurology and studying the brain at that point. So that was 1996. I got my license in 2001. But we really, you look at the stats on these medications now, you know, I talked to counselors too, in the high schools, and over half the kids are on some type of attentional medication, and it’s almost like the kids have to be on them to keep up with the workload and demands. You know, these are drugs that get traded at parties to keep people awake. And I mean, it’s interesting how ubiquitous nowadays in the culture, for just having those attentional issues. \xa0 \xa0 12:06 Ashley James:\xa0That’s really sad. I’ve done a few interviews with people who shared about their childhood experiences. I remember off the top of my head, with guests who shared their experiences with being put on these drugs when they were kids, and that’s what led them to want to become Holistic Health practitioners, because of the adverse side effects, and the horrible nightmares and suicidal thoughts. I mean, don’t, if a drug is going to make your teenager want to kill themselves, you know, because that’s the side effect. I mean, there’s something serously wrong here. And then we’ll continue to let them eat Cheetos, and\xa0 whatever junk food, we’ll keep them on the standard American American diet ,or standard Canadian diet, standard Australian diet, wherever we are, it’s pretty much the standardized flour, sugar oil, hyper palatable foods that are horrible for the nervous system and just jack up the brain. And then we drug them down. It’s kind of like taking uppers and downers, the uppers are the food, the downers are the drugs. And it’s a perfect system that the big pharma gets to profit from. But when a child like Michael, and we put them on a whole foods plant based diet and remove the flour, remove the sugar, remove the hyper palatable foods, the spark is back in their eyes, and they feel so much more grounded in their own body. I recently interviewed an expert on nootropics, and he had adult ADHD. And getting on Ritalin was life changing for him. He loved it, he was so happy to be on it. But then his body became resistant to it. And then all of a sudden his thyroid just went completely through the floor and he got dementia, because he had such low thyroid. And it turns out it was a side effect of being on Ritalin for so many years. Have you ever heard that, about that Ritalin, being on these drugs can really drastically affect our hormone system? \xa0 \xa0 14:15 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Well, sure, yah. You know, the medications are always counter intuitive. Like we’re giving legalize speed to kids that have hyperactivity issues. And really, when it works, it works for 5% of the population. And you know, so that gentleman that you interviewed is probably one in the 5%. I mean, the medications really do help you hyper focus, but what it’s doing is it’s waking up your prefrontal cortex. And that’s what the hyperactivity is a symptom of is, the child or the person is trying to wake themselves up because they have a low functioning cortical brainwaves. And so the medication wakes that up and is turning it back on. That’s why it helps with your focus. So you’re just taking legalized speed. So that’s speeding up of your metabolism. So then your hypothalamus has to balance that out, kind of the switchboard operator there in the middle, which is maintaining homeostasis, kind of coordinating your nervous system and your hormones. And so that’s kind of the link of where that would come together for the individual that then kind of have thyroid issues was out of the hypothalamus level of trying to balance out because they’re getting this speed, which is ramping up the nervous system. And so the counterbalance is in the hormone realm. \xa0 \xa0 15:39 Ashley James:\xa0Right, because the hypothalamus to stimulate the pituitary to create the thyroid… \xa0 \xa0 15:49 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 15:50 Ashley James:\xa0Basically, the hypothalamus is all the way at the top going, “Okay, thyroid, make your stuff. Okay, adrenal is make your stuff. Okay. You know, gonads make your stuff.” And so if you’re taking the ADD medication, it’s affecting the part of your brain that controls all your hormones. \xa0 \xa0 16:09 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 16:11 Ashley James:\xa0That can be very dangerous down the road. But if you go to an MD, and this is me on my soapbox, if you go to an MD, they’re treating symptoms. So we’re going to treat five different symptoms of five drugs then you’ve got lots of side effects from those when it actually is a hypothalamus issue. Because of that, it was a side effect originally of the ADD medication. And so you might end up with problems with the ability to produce your hormones, sex hormones later in life, your steroidal hormones later in life, your thyroid hormone. You might end up with all these different conditions all resulting from the ADD medication of long term use, which we don’t want. And then everyone that’s listening wants to do things naturally and support the body coming back into balance. So when someone feels like they have ADD, what they need to do is wake up the frontal cortex. What can we do to stimulate healthfully naturally the frontal cortex? \xa0 \xa0 17:11 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Well, that’s one piece of it, right? So attentional issues, there’s about nine different facets to attention and so when you look at it, the medication is only working for a small subset. And when you look at what the outcomes research shows is, it doesn’t change IQ, it doesn’t actually change outcomes in schooling. You know, so it is totally placating symptoms, people feel more in tune or maybe more flow and those are the folks that have that hypo functioning prefrontal cortex. So that’s a small subset of folks, but you look at what can you do naturally? Of course, eating a whole foods diet, getting the processed foods out, decreasing your sugar content, you know, the the non sexy, but vital components, which is, food is your best medicine. So looking at that, exercise, right? You get the blood flow. Well, what travels in the blood is the healing properties of the body. So you inform what’s in the blood, but then you get the circulation going as well. One of the things that I got in on one a little bit bigger with, you know, if your child is having significant issues in the classroom, you can get into neurofeedback, so I did that in the clinic here at Nature Cures for six years, which is hooking electrodes up, you get feedback visually from a computer screen, and you are basically training certain wave frequencies, so it’s waking your brain up, and naturally you’re just doing it via a biofeedback or neurofeedback loop. \xa0 \xa0 18:55 Ashley James:\xa0I love that. I did an interview, I feel like about two years ago with a man that created a biofeedback company. And he said it was like the kids are playing video games with their brain. They hook it up to their brain, and they stare at a monitor. And they’re watching, like what they do with their brain moves the things on the screen, so it feels like a video game. And then they get amazing results. And he had actually, he started it because he’s working with nonverbal children on the spectrum of autism, and doing the biofeedback, they were able to help them improve to the point of like, being able to feed themselves, clothe themselves, talk, I mean, it was amazing. The kind of results. Yeah, he was working with, I think something like big university study, and then that motivated him to go out and start his own company. And now anyone can go and do it. But it’s really fun, what we’re seeing with the brain, and with neurofeedback. And so you started doing that, it also reminds me of a Pediatric Occupational therapist I’m friends with who told me that on the playgrounds, you know, when we were kids, there are swings, and then there’s the tire swing that goes around, right? Now, she says it’s a crime that a lot of schools are taking swings away, because she said that the children will self regulate. And you’ve probably seen children do this, where they’ll spin around in a circle, they just no to spin around till they get dizzy. Or they’ll ask you to spin them around, or they’ll get on that tire swing, or they’ll get on the you know, that merry go round that some places still have, some park still have. And they’ll just spin and spin and spin. And she says, neurologically, when they need their brain to kind of be ramped up, they know to spin themselves, and children who like to get on the swing, and just gently go back and forth. They need to calm down their nervous system. It’s funny because that’s totally me, I always went on the swing, I just needed to be calmed and brought down. And she said that children would go in recess and they would sort of self regulate their nervous system, whether they need to be ramped up or ramped down. And now they’re cutting recess times, they’re taking these things out of the playgrounds, and so children are unable to self regulate as well. \xa0 \xa0 21:24 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Oh, yeah, totally. That makes total sense. Or even them cutting PE class, physical education so that’s not occurring anymore, right? And then the kids get more ramped up, they’re not able to self correct. And then there’s more medication prescribed, right? Like, oh, what a catch 22 here. \xa0 \xa0 21:44 Ashley James:\xa0Right. Right. So, you were mentioning the non sexy ways that children can better help themselves by eating a good diet. And you know, getting enough sleep, not allowing your children to drink caffeine, caffeinated, beverages or sugar, making sure they go to bed on time, I would say also, decreasing screen time as well is a big one, because that does really ramp up their nervous system. And then the biofeedback, can you give us a few more things that you have seen work really well for children with ADHD before we move on to talk about Parkinson’s? \xa0 \xa0 22:23 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Sure. Well, I want to really reiterate on the screen time as well. I mean, there was a big summit that I participated in called the Digital Dementia Summit, there’s research coming out of France showing kids gray matter of their brain is shrinking similar to dementia, with screen time greater than seven hours a day, and some kids are on screens greater than seven hours a day. And we’re seeing on imaging, on brain imaging that their brains are looking as if they have dementia of a 65 year old. So this is a significant component, of course, coming from the Naturopathic physician is getting out in nature, let them get their hands and feet dirty, have them run around without shoes, as long as that’s a safe thing to do. You know, and really get out and actually, for the adults to go out and play with them. I think just fostering more play, more imaginative, more imagination as well, just outside in the natural world. These are big things. And we live in the northwest of the United States where it rains for a good portion of the year. But as my kids say, there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad gear. And so you should be able to get out in any climate and get out into nature. You know, it’s really important. \xa0 \xa0 23:53 Ashley James:\xa0I interviewed a man who’s lost, I believe 200 pounds now, it’s more than 200 pounds. I just interviewed him a few months ago. And I think he was like close to 500 pounds three years ago. And he lives in Canada, in Alberta, where they get crazy weather. And he started walking every day no matter what, no matter the weather. And at first I mean, he was so uncomfortable being you know, 500 pounds, right? And he just did it, he’s got out and walked in negative 30 degrees, in blizzard or raining or super hot hundred degree weather. He just did it every day as much as he could. And then that end, stopping eating sugar and flour for lots of vegetables. And yeah, he just he’s so healthy now. He says he’ll never ever miss a day of walking again. And that really inspired me, that I realized how many excuses I bring up whenever I want to go outside. I see one cloud, “Oh no, it’s too cloudy. I’m not going to go outside.” So I need to like you know, suck it up and get out there. Just this morning right before the interview I took my son to a You Pick Farm and we met some friends and we picked zucchini, and kale and corn and potatoes and all kinds of great stuff that we basically bought a week’s worth of vegetables for $30, all organic and it’s fresh out of the ground. And my son picked bugs and ate kale right off the plant. And yeah, that is unbelievable. So great. I definitely recommend people check out farmers markets and You Pick Farms and take your kids with you because it is it’s fun, and they can run around. And it’s so much better than TV. And we brought kids that never eat vegetables and they were eating vegetables. When kids can actually touch them growing out of the ground, they’ll eat them. So we had a lot of fun doing that. And it’s really allowed me to have a great appreciate for the farmers that grow our food, because it takes a lot of work to pull it out of the ground. Any other advice around ADHD for children before we move on? \xa0 \xa0 26:11 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah, sure. A big one on brain nutrient, this will touch base with the neurologic discussion later, is our omega three fatty acids and in particular DHA. They’re lacking in all of our diets and DHA is that active constituent of those omega threes that feed the brain and children respond beautifully to those. They’re anti inflammatory, they soothe the brain, they hit the satiety center, they help with energy and focus. And they’re just major brain food, so that that would be a biggie to look at, investigate your diet. \xa0 \xa0 26:50 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, what’s the best way to get it in our diet? Because you know, everyone says fish oil, I’m not opposed to fish oil, it’s just, you know, there’s so many low quality fish oils out there. And since the fish get their EFAs from algae, we could just skip the murdering fish and go straight to the algae. So, I don’t know what is the best way to get DHA? \xa0 \xa0 27:13 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Well, the algae oil is a great way to do it. But the DHA these, the DHA and EPA are the active constituents. And so you know, as a past vegetarian for over half my life as well. You know, flax oil, etc. These are hard, they’re higher omega threes, but we’re only converting a certain percentage of those into DHA and EPA. So it’s about a 1% to 5% of total omega threes from plant based sources, 1% to 5% go into DHA, and about 5% to 15% go into EPA. And those are the ones that we have the most research on. Now I’m a whole plant practitioner, I love the whole plant. So definitely getting it that way, flax seeds, chia seeds, these have omega three fatty acids in them, it just you know, you would have to be consuming so much of those plants to get an adequate dose of EPA and DHA in particular for the brain. So I definitely, I do recommend supplementing those. You want to know your source, a lot of companies do a really good job of screening for heavy metal toxicity, pesticides, etc. Because these fish do bio accumulate toxins and fat. So you definitely want to know your source. You know, one of the better ones out on the market, at least in the states is Nordic Naturals, I have no affiliation with the company. I just like their product. But you want to know your source for sure. So, it’s not like go to the bulk discount supplement store and and get those because, you know, you really don’t know what you’re getting. And you could do more harm than good with that. \xa0 \xa0 29:06 Ashley James:\xa0There’s only a handful of companies that will make their fish oil supplements in a nitrogen chamber, which prevents the oil from oxidizing and that’s one of the companies that I get my EFAs from, does that and so that’s my big recommendation for quality is to find out if your company does it, produces the EFA in a nitrogen chamber to prevent the oxygen from oxidizing the oil. So you’re saying if children have ADHD, the best way to get DHA into them for their brain health is through fish oil, because they would have to consume so much flax and chia? \xa0 \xa0 29:45 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Correct. Yeah, it would be really hard for them to get adequate levels to actually make a difference there. Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 29:52 Ashley James:\xa0I eat plant based and my husband’s vegan, but we’re not dogmatic. You know what I mean? \xa0 \xa0 30:00 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. Sometimes it’s a medicinal quality and that’s kind of the distinction we made in my household as well. If it’s a medicinal quality item, it might be something that you want to look at, because that’s a big, that’s a showstopper, you know, they’re called essential as essentially, we can’t make them in our bodies, we can only get them from our food. And so that’s one aspect that you want to look at. \xa0 \xa0 30:29 Ashley James:\xa0And why is DHA and EPA so important? Is it because 70% of the brain is made from these healthy fats? I’ve heard that like, I think 70% of the white matter of the brain is made from cholesterol. So it’s like a major part of the brain is made from these fats. Is it because the brain is made from it, so we’re just building healthy brain? Or does it play a different role in protecting it? \xa0 \xa0 30:51 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0We really could call each other fat heads, and it is a fat storage, and we need these really beneficial fats to help with as building blocks for more fat. So these are essential in a lot of different processes. It’s not that DHA is the substance that the brain is made of, but it is definitely the brain food of choice. Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 31:15 Ashley James:\xa0Awesome. So, you must have some really great experiences helping children recover from this, like, YouTube dementia and ADHD. \xa0 \xa0 31:30 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 31:32 Ashley James:\xa0But you’ve also have great, great experience helping adults recover from Parkinson’s and MS, and other neurological conditions. Let’s talk about that. \xa0 \xa0 31:45 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Sure. Well, this is more recent, so I’ve been in practice since 2001. So, I still have a very eclectic practice here at Nature Cures Clinic in Portland. And you kind of fast forward through about 15, 16 years of clinical practice. And lo and behold, my wife gets a very rare neurological condition called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is a preonic activity of the brain, very rare one in a million people about 300 cases a year in North America. And you know, as loving husband and physician, trying to swing for the fence of like, well, there’s no known cure for this. The diagnosis is basically wait until she dies and then we’ll do a brain autopsy and will confirm the diagnosis. It was just crazy and you know, she did pass last year. \xa0 \xa0 32:54 Ashley James:\xa0I’m so sorry to hear that. \xa0 \xa0 32:56\xa0 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah, thank you. You know, it’s been, you know, life is full contact. And I think things happen for reasons and I just definitely lifted the veil for me on the illusion of our world and kind of reinstated my faith, you know, big things, like it was a big process that I’ve gone through, and what I’ve got, as a result, definitely a lot of heartfelt gratitude for this world, and our plane of existence and the physicality of our bodies and the planet and our universe. And I’d like to say as I lecture and speak, we have this illusion of separateness, and we really are all one, just pretending to be separate in this current time. And this process, this process that I went through really solidified that for me, and I’ve wound up with a bunch of gifts, what I’m calling Soraya’s gifts, that’s her name. It was her name, Soraya, and, you know, what do you say, I mean, life happens, I’m not the first person to lose the love of their life, but it definitely is humbling when it happens to you. And I’ve got just newfound energy, purpose, passion, focused to help more people, it really solidified my purpose and service to others and share what I’ve learned along the way, and so on as a practitioner, and as a being on the planet, definitely. Sometimes I feel like I’m an ambassador for grief. You know, we don’t do grief very well as a culture and I guess I’m more comfortable with it. So as it arises, I’m fine sharing and showing and just being with it. And so I think definitely has informed me as a practitioner with more empathy for others and what they are going through. And just as a being on the planet, having a loss, and, you know, grief touches on grief for a lot of people. So it’s interesting to see what surfaces for others when you bring up a loss like this. And I went looking for solutions and remedies and it really didn’t have, there’s no known cure, and you look at chronic neurodegeneration, and there’s no known cure across the board. We’re talking Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\xa0 which is mad cow syndrome, and people, it’s scrappy, and goats. It’s Chronic Wasting Disease and dear. So these preonic activities, which are misfolded proteins in central nervous system and brain matter. Well, you get in on the preonic diseases textbook, which I have the second edition of that. And you realize, oh, all of these neurodegenerative states; dementia, Alzheimer’s anxiety can be categorized in here as well, can be related to preonic activity, which are misfolded proteins. And we don’t have great solutions for that, which you know, is evidence for Parkinson’s. I started with Parkinson’s, I have a book coming out called Shake It Off: An Integrative Approach To Parkinson’s Syndrome, or Parkinson’s Solutions. And with that, we look at what can we do for these folks, and I put it in on my clinic, the different things that I was learning for Soraya. And lo and behold, we’re getting results for folks. I’m not saying I’m curing Parkinson’s, but we are showing improvement of quality of life, we’re showing reversal, stability, halting symptom development, reversal of symptom development, and improvement of functioning. And so these are very encouraging things. We’ve got some time to put in on really perfecting the protocol, but I did develop, it’s called a FAN-C approach to Parkinson’s, capital FAN-C so FAN-C, we can talk about that in a moment. But it all comes out of my personal trials and tribulations of helping, looking for solutions and a chronic disease that doesn’t have any answers. So, I was talking to the world’s experts on preonic activities, got in touch with Case Western here in the United States, where they have the Preonic Surveillance Center of North America, didn’t even know one existed in their study, it’s an observational study. They have had 22 people enrolled in their study. So, you know, we don’t really have a lot of great information or data and I got to live with that condition for two years. You know, it’s a rapidly progressing dementia, in two months time, Soraya, she was a certified nurse, midwife, nurse practitioner here in the clinic, and, you know, radical women’s health care provider, you know, just had such joy and love for people. And never had in a million years would you think a woman would come out of her annual exam kind of dancing and singing and laughing. And it’s like, wow, like, what a gift Soraya had for people. So, she was this sharp, sharp practitioner, and all of a sudden started having memory issues, and we wound up in the clinic staying later and she had been in practice for five years at that point. Like, “Hey, honey, what what is up?” Like, never have we stayed, you know, like, I get it, you’re being meticulous with your notes, but what is going on? So, we started looking at maybe some perimenopause hormone changes, or maybe mold issues. You look at things that could be creating memory issues for folks, and you kind of go down these rabbit holes of most prominent issues. And after about a month of that I started taking her, it’s like, “Gosh, this is beyond what I can do here.” It’s not these things, it’s not hormone imbalance, it’s not mold toxicity. You know, it’s not a level of toxicity. So, you know, go out into Western approach just to get some ideas, and they’re all saying it’s a psychotic break, and it’s like, this is not a psychotic break. This woman was top of her game just a month ago. And so, it kind of went through that process and then the differential starts getting more ominous and ominous of like, oh, it could be autoimmune encephalitis or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. So during this time, Soraya’s in rapid decline, and then basically in two months time, she’s not able to talk like she’s gone into total dementia. And, you know, it’s like, wow, we’re nonverbal. We can’t communicate now. It’s like, what in the world is going on? So, it was really a tough, tough go and we surrounded her with lots of love and I did a little swing for the fences, a baseball analogy of, you know, let me dig deep here and see what I can come up with and the trail I’ve got this component of Soraya’s gifts of I think we can help a lot of people with chronic neurodegeneration as a result of this. Unfortunately, it didn’t help her out. But, we’ve got, you know, maybe trying to turn my personal tragedy into this gift for the world. And so that’s what we’re putting forth. \xa0 \xa0 41:26 Ashley James:\xa0Now, I always thought mad cow disease or mad cow syndrome was transmissible, meaning it could be passed on from one person to another, from one animal to another. Is this something she caught? \xa0 \xa0 41:41 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Well, so that’s the million dollar question. And when you read about preons, they always put this infectious prion before this adjective. And I think it’s incorrect to think of it as an infectious agent. Now, I say that it’s total theory on my part, but it’s a theory on their part as well. So Stanley Prusiner out of a lab in California, he got the Nobel Prize in 1987 in medicine for the discovery of these prion. And he was really uniquely positioned to be one of the only people on the planet to be able to figure this out. He was a bench biochemist. And at the time, they thought prions were a virus like a retrovirus. And he had spent 20, 30 years in the lab studying viruses and bacteria. And he said, “You know, these are not behaving like that.” And so he stuck to his guns, but two decades of ridicule and the scientific community for him, thankfully he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for that. But, you know, he put this infectious adjective there. So when you read any literature on it, you know, it was it’s also called “Kuru” in Papua New Guinea, there was a tradition where the grandmothers, mothers and girls would eat the brains of the ancestors that passed in honoring and in commemoration and honoring of those that passed. And I think they’ve stopped that tradition, because in the brains were these prions. And so it was a very rapid transmission of prionic activity by ingesting those brains. If it was transmissible from cow to human, in the 80s there were about 3 million pounds of tainted beef that were released in Europe. And there was a slight uptick of Creutzfeldt-Jakob but not to the level that you would expect if these were infectious agents as in something to catch. Now, there are those scientists that still think that they are infectious, like a virus that they can spread like that. But I think it’s a little bit more complex. And these are not new proteins, I think these are archaic protein structures that have been on the planet since we began. And the reason why I say that is they are so uniquely, what they do is they misfold, these proteins misfold. And when you look at tau proteins and amyloid plaques, and\xa0[Inaudible 44:33]\xa0nucleon, these are other proteins that are misfolded disorders that are also in dementia and Alzheimer’s and ALS, Parkinson’s. So they’re found in these other conditions of misfolding. Well, what happens is, they get misconfigured and then they start signaling other proteins to start to do that. And that’s I think why they call them “infectious.” And that there’s a signaling unit that happens once they get misfolded. Now, we don’t know. And that’s the issue with these disorders and diagnosis is, is that we don’t know what the causative agent of misfolding is. \xa0 \xa0 45:17 Ashley James:\xa0It’s like a domino effect. \xa0 \xa0 45:19\xa0 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Exactly. \xa0 \xa0 45:20\xa0 Ashley James:\xa0It’s kind of like cancer. If the body can’t clear it out, well one cancer cell normally… I mean, every day our body clears cancer out. But if we don’t, that one little harmless cancer cell can become a whole tumor very quickly. So the domino effect is that one misfolded protein could trigger others to start misfolding. But why, why isn’t the body clearing them out? \xa0 \xa0 45:45 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Right. And they’re not unable to kill, you know, you can’t kill them really, either. So that’s the unique property of these prions is, you know, heat, autoclaving. You know, the traditional ways of denaturing proteins don’t work for these. \xa0 \xa0 46:08 Ashley James:\xa0So it sounds like we’re just sort of at the beginning, the Pioneer days of understanding this. Now, you found out… I mean, your wife had a rapid decline, and you found out very deep into her diagnosis what it was. Did you any therapies to prolong her life or ease her symptoms? Did you find anything in time that helped her that you noticed that helped? \xa0 \xa0 46:42 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Well, not. No, no. So not in her condition. So, what I put together is a process called the FAN-C approach. So this is for all neurologic conditions, but F stands for functional, so treating whole people, not disease processes. And this is also a very profound difference between Naturopathic medicine and maybe Functional or Integrative practitioners that come from a Western training. In the Naturopathic principles is the body can heal itself, given the right information. And at the point that we’ve got this discovered with Soraya, I just feel like the process, it was so rapid and moving so quickly, that there wasn’t a way to pull it back. You know, really, I went super esoteric to very biochemical. So, every level of treatment that you could think of, we’ve really put in just two decades in the field, definitely very eclectic practitioner. So, on that functional approach, it’s really kind of a mindset change of, I think one of the issue is, is that everybody’s focused at end stage product or disease. And if you’re only focusing at that, like for Parkinson’s, just focusing on dopamine receptors and the dopamine molecule, it’s far too late. Like we’ve really have to go upstream. And one way of doing that is looking at the assessment. So the A in FAN-C stands for assessment. And this is looking at molecular mimicry, like what else could be causing the symptoms in the body? So I look at viruses; cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, epstein barr virus, these things can mimic these protein misfolding disorders. We look at hormone balance, because the hormones as we were talking about with attention deficit disorder and stimulating the prefrontal cortex, you know, that comes with into the hypothalamus. Well, that balances the hormones and nervous system there. So hormones, you definitely want to have optimally balanced out for people. Heavy metal toxicity is another one, right? We store toxins in our fat. So we want to look at what gets stored in the fat. So you have to look at, I find cadmium, mercury, arsenic and lead are the top four that I find in my patients, especially with neuro degenerative states. So you gotta get out the proverbial lead, so to speak. \xa0 \xa0 49:32 Ashley James:\xa0I have a quick question, if sure cadmium, lead, arsenic, and mercury are stored in the fat tissue of the body, how do you do accurate heavy metal testing? Because I know you can do hair analysis, which really only reflects the last three months. And blood and urine wouldn’t really do it, if it’s stored in the fat. Do you have to do a biopsy of fat? \xa0 \xa0 49:57 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0You do a chelating agent. Yeah, so one of the things with hair analysis, also, there’s a lot of folks that have issues with metal toxicity, aren’t able to secrete them in the hair follicle, so they’re not able to get them out. And I see that a lot with kids on the autistic spectrum disorder. You know, a lot of practitioners are only doing hair analysis. Well, it doesn’t correlate well. And like you’re saying it’s only three months. And also there’s a genetic component where you’re not able to actually excrete those through the hair follicle or eliminate them yourself. And so they get trapped in the body. And that adds to the issue of the condition. So what we do, we do a pre and post test, there are different oral chelating agents like DMSA or IV therapy with EDTA, which is the kind of a toxicology route of the agreed upon test to do, which is like a big magnet that goes into the blood that pulls metals, but it also pulls essential minerals as well. So, you know, you have to be very cautious and do that correctly. It has been around, chelation has been around for 50 years, plus done with a trained practitioner is very safe and it is super effective as well. \xa0 \xa0 51:22 Ashley James:\xa0I would agree with you, we should absolutely go to a Naturopathic physician if we want to do chelation because it’s kind of like using a nuclear bomb on the body to release the heavy metal. And then you’re going to have to get a nice mineral and trace mineral supplement to help put back in what we took out. So I really agree with you there. I interviewed Dr. Klinghardt who’s local to me, and he works with a lot of children on spectrum come from all over the world to see him. And he gets children that are having very poor health problems to be able to within a year go to school, like just a huge transformation. And he says it’s almost always heavy metals, like it’s just unbelievable. Their body cannot detox the heavy metals. You know, they were probably given vaccines and you know, it’s controversial whether vaccines cause autism or not, depending on who you talk to. There’s lots of information depending on who you talk to. But what we do know for a fact is that there’s heavy metals in vaccines, and that autistic children have a problem with detoxing. And so they have an accumulation of heavy metals in their neurology, and what Dr. Klinghardt brings up is, what we’re seeing now, one in 40 children are on the spectrum, whereas when you and I were kids, it was one in 10,000. And we’re wondering, is it actually autism? Or are we miss diagnosing a large percentage of the population? Because what they actually have is all the same symptoms of autism, but it’s their brain is full of heavy metals. And if we remove the heavy metals, they no longer are on the spectrum. \xa0 53:11 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah, and it’s not, I wouldn’t put it as a blanket statement for all children, or people on the spectrum have heavy metal toxicity. But there is a good portion of folks that that is the case. So I have seen folks on the spectrum that they don’t have metals in their system, because we’re tracking for that. But I have seen, you know, I’ve had moms calling me from the grocery store saying, you know, “Johnny just sang and looked in his sister’s eyes, first time ever in his life that he’s ever had any interaction, and he was vocal and verbal.” It was like, you know, true miracles like that. And for him, we were chelating him with a an oral DMPS or sorry, a topical cream that we were doing some chelation therapy with. So you know, it is definitely, you got to rule it in or rule it out. Really the take home message is anytime you’re dealing with neurological issues, we store toxins in our fat, we can call each other fat heads because there’s so much fat in our head, you know, our brain is fat, and we store toxins there. So we definitely have to look at that. So that’s on the assessment front. There’s more on the assessment front as well and each of these are such, we can unpack each one as well. But I run an Alcat testing looking at food sensitivities, so not allergens, but sensitivity. So that’s white blood cells that get exposed to different foods, food additives, molds, etc. And we see how the body is responding to these items. And then we also run a gut microbiome test, GI maps to look at the health of the gut. Because the gut is the second brain, we manufacture all of our neurotransmitters for brain health in the gut, our digestion is so important to that. And we’re looking at the whole microbiome and even there’s some theories around glyphosate from roundup and pesticide use, you know, killing certain gut bugs that were responsible for creating dopamine and other nutrients for our brain – neurotransmitters. So, you know, there’s more and more information coming out that way. So we got to look at the gut too. So those are the four main areas that I look at for brain health, for really all of my patients coming in with these diagnoses. And so that assessment, I just feel like people are not getting a proper assessment, because it leaves a lot of options out there rather than treating symptoms, like you were saying, you know, going Western approach and you’re gonna get put on a bunch of different medications to treat a symptom. This is one way that I found, it really trace it down to the root imbalances and address at a very deep, profound level. \xa0 \xa0 56:12 Ashley James:\xa0Absolutely. I want to know why. I mean, obviously, it’s very important to check the gut flora. We wanted a healthy microbiome. When someone has a microbiome that’s out of balance, maybe they had an antibiotic in the last year and they know they’ve got really out of balanced gut flora, or maybe they have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or candida, why does that affect brain health? \xa0 \xa0 56:41 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0So on that level, so we have the vagus nerve that comes down, it’s a cranial nerve, cranial nerve 10 that comes down innervates the gut. And there’s a lot of different theories on this, Ployvagal theory, Stephen Porges has a component around the vagus nerve, and it’s important to our health and around PTSD and anxiety and depression states. So that’s one aspect, but the vagus nerve, cranial nerve 10 comes down innervates the gut. And so there are certain things that get transmitted up and down that nerve, in addition to just the nervous system, you know, different nutrients; manganese, iron, these things get deposited in the brain, and so there’s a connection there. And then also you look at, well, there are certain probiotics, so gut bugs, that their secretion is the end product that our brains need for proper functioning. So it’s so fascinating. The research on probiotics is getting so sophisticated to look at this. And you know, I actually did a lecture to providers, I’m part of this go wellness affiliated network of about 40 clinics right now, its regenerative medicine clinics. And I gave these docs and providers the notes on, there’s research on specific neurotransmitters being produced by the gut bugs. \xa0 \xa0 58:19 Ashley James:\xa0I love it. \xa0 \xa0 58:20 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 58:21 Ashley James:\xa0So cool. I love that we need these other living beings, this amazing symbiotic relationship. And just thinking of mitochondria, the mitochondria are not us, like we had a guest talk about that they have different DNA, but they’re part of us. But it’s like, you have to think of mitochondria, it’s like a different being joined us and all the gut flora, and then all the healthy bacteria on our skin, and we just keep finding as science marches on that there’s even more importance, the rule that these healthy bacteria plays. So it’s kinda like a garden. You know, it’s amazing garden where all the healthy bugs are keeping everything in balance, but it’s in our body and on our body. And so we’ve got to think that we need to foster this healthy garden that comes back to how Naturopaths consider the whole body and the terrain of the body. We want to fertilize and balance the whole body. It’s so cool that our neurotransmitters that so many of them are made in the gut by the healthy gut bugs. \xa0 \xa0 59:33 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 59:33 Ashley James:\xa0I love it. \xa0 \xa0 59:34 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. Yeah, it’s a little bit gross, too, right? If you took all the aerobic and anaerobic gut bugs out depending on the individual, about four to seven pounds of material. And, you know, it’s just like, wow, that’s a whole ecosystem unto itself. Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 59:55 Ashley James:\xa0I love it. I love my gut bugs. We get along. \xa0 \xa0 59:56 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. I do too. \xa0 \xa0 1:00:00 Ashley James:\xa0I have a friend, Dr. Megan Saunders and she’s been on the show many times. She used to be addicted to kombucha back when she was in the Naturopathic school. She was known as the kombucha lady and she says that it takes over your brain. She really believes that, that when you start drinking things or eating fermented foods that the gut bugs start making you crave that food more because they want more of that environment in itself. \xa0 \xa0 1:00:26 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Oh yeah. They secrete right into the bloodstream that goes up to your brain saying, “Feed us.” \xa0 \xa0 1:00:31 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. And so you start craving the kombucha. For me it’s the, I love the sauerkraut at Costco. They’ve got great organic sauerkraut and my Costco and my gut just craves it. \xa0 \xa0 1:00:43 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0That’s awesome. That’s a good craving. \xa0 \xa0 1:00:45 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. Awesome. So we’ve got functional which is looking at the whole person, meaning looking at their emotional state, their sleep, their lifestyle, then looking at the assessment of all the things inside the person that could be off; heavy metals, viruses, bacteria, mold, all the stuff inside their body, their gut flora being off, what’s the N stand for? \xa0 \xa0 1:01:11 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0N is for nerve health. So you’re looking at specific nutrients for nerve health. And you know, the most famous is B12. But you’ve got glutathione there. The DHA that we talked about EPA, there are certain nutrients that are renowned for brain health. So, we put that in making sure that you have that in your diet. Glutathione is one of those things for your mitochondria. There’s NAD as well, treatments for mitochondrial health and energy, but also nutrients for nerves. So we look at that aspect to make sure you’ve got your bases covered there. \xa0 \xa0 1:01:57 Ashley James:\xa0What’s NAD? \xa0 \xa0 1:01:57 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0NAD is derivative of vitamin B3, niacin. Yeah, and NAD is big in the longevity movement right now for energy production. It’s a specific food into the mitochondria. \xa0 \xa0 1:02:20 Ashley James:\xa0Oh, got it. Because I know what NAC is. So I was like, oh what’s NAD? So that’s different. So it’s a derivative of the B vitamin that supports the mitochondria? \xa0 \xa0 1:02:30 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:02:30 Ashley James:\xa0Hmm, awesome. Can we get it from whole foods or do we need to buy it as a supplement? \xa0 \xa0 1:02:35 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0That one is tough. You know, there are some supplements with dubious claims. And you know that one, I do it via IV is the way that I get that one into the body. \xa0 \xa0 1:02:57 Ashley James:\xa0When someone starts taking the NAD IV, what kind of effects do they notice? \xa0 \xa0 1:03:03 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0They’ll notice decreased brain fog, more energy, clear thinking. Along those lines. \xa0 \xa0 1:03:10 Ashley James:\xa0Whoo, sign me up. That sounds great. When you do an IV, do you normally do like a cocktail? Like a Myers push where it’s a bunch of vitamins? \xa0 \xa0 1:03:21 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0With the NAD, it’s pretty much straight up NAD. You can include those other items in there. Before or after but the NAD goes by itself. \xa0 \xa0 1:03:32 Ashley James:\xa0Got it. Very cool. Now, we’ll definitely make sure the links to everything you do is in the show notes of today’s podcast,\xa0www.naturecuresclinic.com. \xa0 \xa0 1:03:42 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yes. \xa0 \xa0 1:03:42 Ashley James:\xa0The listeners can go. Now, you do take clients all around the world through phone or Skype. But for them to be able to do the IV they’d have to come to the beautiful city of Portland Oregon. \xa0 \xa0 1:03:54 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yes. Yeah, and Ido have people traveling from around the globe. They come to Camp Nature Cures, but there is a lot of stuff that we can do remotely. I do via Zoom, some of those telemedicine things, but you know, to get some of these therapies, I haven’t figured out how to deliver it over the internet yet. \xa0 \xa0 1:04:16 Ashley James:\xa0I’m still waiting for like, smell-o-vision. Watch the TV and be able to smell it. Yeah. Very cool. Okay, so those nootropics are the N. \xa0 \xa0 1:04:28 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah, exactly. \xa0 \xa0 1:04:30\xa0 Ashley James:\xa0And then what’s the C? \xa0 \xa0 1:04:32 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0C is for cellular regeneration. And so we’re living at a really interesting time, where we can do regenerative medicine with stem cells and exosomes, and these therapies to help the body create new brain tissue. \xa0 \xa0 1:04:51 Ashley James:\xa0I love it. I love it. So you’re using stem cell therapy for the brain? \xa0 \xa0 1:04:57 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Correct. \xa0 \xa0 1:04:58 Ashley James:\xa0And what kind of results are you seeing? \xa0 \xa0 1:05:01 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0You know, we are getting folks with Parkinson’s, we’re having folks’ tremors halt and reverse. We’re having their gait, they’re walking become more stable, more fluid, we’re having their speech improve as well. So there are some big, some reversal of symptoms. Again, I’m not claiming that for everybody. But we have seen it, we’ve got clinical evidence of it, and we’re looking to improve those results for a lot of people. But, you know, my patients got sick of just being serially monitored, they’d go in to the specialist, the Neurologist and be run through a battery of tests. And then basically not even told what was going on, just see you next year. And when they would ask the doc would say, well, you’re getting worse. And they’re thinking, well, I could have told you that before I came in here. And, you know, we’re just looking to provide some options, alternatives, some hope that there are people working on it. Like, for instance, on the NAD. There’s a researcher down at Scripps University at University of Florida. And she’s doing research on NAD IVs and prionic disorders. And so, it’s too early for primetime use but I’m saying, you know, look, if we’ve got this research, we know this is a safe therapy in humans, my folks that have these diagnosis is they don’t have 30 to 40 years to wait for the definitive research to come out. It’s like you know, let’s use it now and see what we can do. \xa0 \xa0 1:06:49 Ashley James:\xa0I love it. Absolutely. I have seen and heard of actually because I’ve interviewed some people about this. People with Parkinson’s getting great results using medical marijuana or CBD and hemp that when they use the CBD drops that then their shaking goes away. \xa0 \xa0 1:07:10 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:07:11 Ashley James:\xa0Have you also seen that some people with Parkinson’s have great improvement? \xa0 \xa0 1:07:15 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yes. So on that nerve health, CBD, cannabidiol is definitely one of those nerve health supplements. And, you know, when I went to medical school, we did not know about the endocannabinoid system. I did a lecture three years ago at American Academy of Environmental Medicine for cannabidiol for the treatment of anxiety. And you look at Professor Mechoulam out of Israel. He’s the scientist that discovered the endocannabinoid system. And there are more receptors in the central nervous system, they’re called CB1, cannabidiol one. There are more receptors for that molecule, than all of the other neurotransmitters put together, which is just, I mean, it’s almost overwhelming to think about, like we didn’t even know about that system when I went to medical school. And now there’s discovered more receptors for that molecule than all of the other neurotransmitters put together. So that is definitely, that endocannabinoid system, it needs toned. You know, eating endocannabinoid rich foods that feed that system. And then you know, taking CBD is definitely one of those things, again, source matters there, you want to make sure you’ve got its medical grade, it’s tested. One of the things that the hemp plant does, it will rehab toxic land, so it will pull up toxins out of the soil. So you want to just make sure you’ve got a really good source, if you are using that. Again, source matters. So for all of these items, yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:08:58 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, same with chlorella and spirulina, they’ll just suck up. I mean, it’s great to use chlorella, spirulina to clean up waterways. And to use the hemp plant to clean soil, right? That’s good to clean up areas, but not to consume. So we have to make sure that the soil is clean and the water is clean. If we’re going to consume these crops. I thought it was really interesting that if we’re deficient in our essential fatty acids, we can’t produce enough of the… basically our body’s own CBD. And so then we’re CBD deficient, so that if someone takes CBD and gets a really great result, it’s because they were deficient in it. And if someone takes CBD, and it’s really good quality, it’s tested, we know that there’s actually CBD in it. And they don’t feel any difference, then maybe they weren’t as deficient. But the people who are really deficient, who obviously have neurological symptoms, they’ll see the biggest shift because their body was deficient. And that also then points to the fact that they are deficient in their essential fatty acids because their body can’t produce enough of their own cannabinoids. \xa0 \xa0 1:10:16\xa0 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah, yeah, that’s it. And you know, and that makes a great point in that. I haven’t found one thing to be the be all end all in any really condition. And so, you know, I think our want is like, just give me the one thing, doc. And if there’s this when you’re talking about neuro degeneration, it’s so multifactorial. You know, when we talk about possible causative agents, definitely levels of toxicity, play a role in Parkinson’s, that’s clearly defined in the literature from pesticides, metals, sometimes infections also can be triggering events for folks. And so, you got to do the multi pronged approach. But more is not better. More is more. So oftentimes, I’ll see people come in with the laundry list of supplements or research and saying, I’m taking all of these things, there is this concept that I want to make sure I share with your listeners is that it’s called Zhang of the formula or direction. And in Chinese medicine, herbs, there’s an emperor or empress, then there’s generals, and then assistants, and everybody lines up. So imagine, the emperor or empress is at the very tip, if it was like an Arrowhead and it’s cutting through and moving in a direction. And so whatever plan or program that you get on, you want to make sure you have a direction, and that there’s a leading herb or a leading therapy, and everything else lines up behind and helps with that motion in a direction. Because otherwise, we kind of get into the shotgun approach a more is better. And I’ll see people with like, grocery bags full of supplements, like, “Ugh. You have to one, digest all of that. Two, process at all, absorb it all.” And then it’s pulling your vital force, your vitality in all of these different directions. So the body and its inherent wisdom doesn’t really know which way to go with all of that information coming in. So, you know, sometimes we’ll break those up for folks and have them like cycle through by month or it really is on, are we getting a result or not. And then the other thing that comes off of that, when talking about the Zhang of the formula or direction, or assembling a program or protocol for an individual, you know, we all have our unique genetic platforms. And that’s when you asked about,\xa0 how does the prions get transmitted? Are they contagious? Can you “catch” them? You know, why I think we didn’t see this huge outbreak of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Europe in the 80s was, well, maybe the genetic platform wasn’t susceptible to that. People ate tainted beef, there were 3 million pounds of beef that got released. Now, a lot of that got recalled, but a lot of that got consumed. And we would have expected to see a bigger outbreak. Now some say, “Well, okay, it’s like a smoking gun, maybe then you’ve got these prions in there, they haven’t been totally activated, maybe traumas, maybe level of toxicity.” And then I would say those definitely influenced expression, but also then on top of a more susceptible genetic platform, which then even goes one step further is looking at, okay, well, I got even into looking at ancestral traumas turning on genes that then express today. So some of the conditions that we see in modern era aren’t even the individual’s issue, right? It was their great grandmother’s trauma that set them up for that. And it has definitely made my job as a physician so much harder, to be able to have the time to spend with somebody talking about all of these levels of care, and possible root imbalances. So, I definitely wind up talking to my patients about their family lineage, family trees, but not just in a purely genetic sense, but in an energetic sense of getting back into communication with your lineage and your ancestors. Like, that’s why you’re here today, they were here, right? That DNA, that information got passed down through time, through your great grandparents and grandparents and parents, and now to you, and then maybe to your offspring. And so, one aspect is really giving thanks, or gratitude, being grateful for it, but then, you know, also acknowledging and letting your ancestors know, like, Hey, we’re going to stop, I’m not taking the family burden further. Like, I’m letting that down, and you know, consciously saying it, because it makes an imprint in your limbic system and amygdala and your cells, and your body is so responsive, and to be able to acknowledge and give thanks. And then also, say, I’m not taking this burden any further. I welcome the energy and intuition, and inspiration. Like, you know, bring all of that to me ancestors, but we’re going to leave the family traumas, the burdens, you know, whatever got set up in the past, we’re going to leave that now. Like, we don’t need to carry that forward anymore. Because it does get past, it just dawned on me, like, wow, that’s where that curse of seven generations, where that comes from, it’s like, we can actually trace out 13 generations now from a trauma that occurred 13 generations ago, expressing through a family’s lineage. So, it’s doing techniques of grounding yourself and deep breathing, and I love playing with the voice and kind of frequencies and singing, all of these accessing all of the different healing modalities, and really putting those in, depending on what your specific issue is. But, you know, you can really find folks that are tying these things together, and designing a program specific to you as an individual. \xa0 \xa0 1:16:49 Ashley James:\xa0You would love timeline therapy, it’s one of the techniques I’ve been using since 2005. And that’s actually the technique that I’m going to teach on your show. Dr. Eckel has a great podcast called What The Health, What The Health! So listeners are going to check out your your podcast, because they’ll love it. And I have a technique to reverse, to eliminate, to end anxiety, to completely cut it off at the root. And it’s a timeline therapy technique. But in timeline therapy, we go back to the root cause, the beginning of the Gestalt, the chain of stored emotions in the body that are unresolved. And so the root cause of anger, sadness, fear, hurt and guilt. And we go back to generations and we’ve had so many accounts where people will go back, and it’s light state of trance. So you’re conscious of your unconscious mind, that’s the coolest part because people are a little afraid of going under hypnosis. It’s not hypnosis, but you become aware of your unconscious. And anyone who wants to learn more about how neurology stores memories, there’s two books I love, The Heart’s Code by Paul Piersol and The Holographic Universe, I forget the author’s name. The Holographic Universe, and The Hearts Code are amazing. And they both prove that we store memories basically in our cells, holographically through the whole body. It’s not just in our brain. And we can absolutely pass down memories, that there have been numerous accounts where people have had heart transplants, and they are able to have memories of the person’s murder to the point where they were able to tell the police what the murderer looked like. And they were able to find them and put them in prison. And so when we have memories from organ transplants, I mean, it’s just amazing that the body, there’s definitely the esoteric, you know, we have to just like expand our minds, right? \xa0 \xa0 1:18:59 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:19:00 Ashley James:\xa0You know, because we’re all sort of like thinking that leeches, like, you know, a hundred years ago, or 500 years ago, like, oh, everyone just needs to do bloodletting, right? I mean, just imagine, that’s kind of where we are. We’re all thinking like, memories are just stored in the brain. Right? But that’s common knowledge. But it’s not true, memories are stored holographically throughout the whole body. And in timeline therapy, when we go to release and learn from and heal the negative emotions in the body, people will have memories from their grandmother. And if the grandmother is still alive, they’ll be able to go and confirm them, or memories from their mother, and their healing stuff.\xa0 Before they were even born that they’ve never been told about that they never knew. And they’re able to go and confirm with their family members, after we do the timeline therapy that those events actually happened. So they’re stored, we store memories from our ancestors in our body. And of course, we’re storing that trauma. So that’s like that emotional, mental, a little bit esoteric, part of healing. And then on the totally like lab science part of healing. I was fascinated to hear about this study with mice where they took these beautiful white fuzzy mice, you’ve probably heard this study, and they expose them to the levels of BPA, Bisphenol A, that we are normally exposed to on a daily basis every time we touch receipts and drink from plastic bottles with BPA. And what happened is their genes transformed, they be genetically shifted, they no longer grew beautiful soft white fur, they grew gnarly yellow fur, they became obese. And then they stopped giving them the BPA, I think it was just water, the BPA was put in their water, they stopped giving it to them. But that this genetic expression lasted I believe, three generations. So they had basically gnarly yellow mice that were obese for three generations. So just think about the chemicals that your grandparents were exposed to, and that change their neurology, or sorry, changed their biochemistry, because it turned on these different expressions epigenetically, and you’re experiencing the result. And now we’re seeing that all the toxins that we’ve been exposed to, and our children be exposed to, like, look at now that over 70% of the population is overweight, because of all these obesogens. And all the exposure to Bisphenol A, just one of the many toxins, but that it changes our genes. So even if we completely cleaned up our environment, our genes for the next few generations might pass on, these characteristics. And that’s why we have to be extra careful and extra diligent to be clean, and also advocate for a cleaner environment. But then, like you said, do the emotional mental work as well, because we are seeing a link between decreasing stress, healing emotions, working on releasing ancestral trauma, and how our genes actually express in the now. So, it’s so cool that our body will respond to emotional healing on a physical level. \xa0 \xa0 1:22:22 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah, so profound. And oftentimes, like you’re saying, does not get addressed at all. \xa0 \xa0 1:22:30 Ashley James:\xa0Because there’s no profit, they can’t make a drug, right? The pharmaceutical company can’t pay someone to do research to make a drug to heal your trauma from the past, otherwise, they would have made it. So we have to go out and advocate and listen to you and your podcast and listen to the experts who are willing to teach us about how we can heal our body on a whole level; emotional, mental, spiritual and energetic and physical. Because we’re not going to get it from the mainstream media. \xa0 \xa0 1:23:01 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Right. \xa0 \xa0 1:23:03 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. So I love your FAN-C. I think that’s a great system. \xa0 \xa0 1:23:08 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yes. \xa0 \xa0 1:23:09 Ashley James:\xa0I studied with a Naturopathic physician who’s like, he’s in his 80s now and he was a Veterinarian, physician and Pathologist, and he was a Research Scientist before he became a Naturopath. And he says that most Parkinson’s and MS and ALS are a combination of too much oxidative damage to the brain. So eating fried food, standard American diet, and too much oxidative damage and oxidative stress to the brain, and not enough of the essential nutrients the body needs to heal the brain. So it’s sort of like too much fire in the body and not enough nutrients to put out the fire. And that he’s seen great results and met a woman who went on his sort of basically… his program is stop eating stuff that causes the damage and start eating the stuff that helps the body heal and take the supplements that you mentioned. And I met a woman who was in a wheelchair one month and the next month was walking, and she couldn’t believe it. So people are getting great results from avoiding the oxidative stress. How much has that played a role when you look into this research when you work with your clients? Are you seeing getting people off of fried food getting people off of, even consuming oil in a bottle? Because that is consuming oxidative stress, right? So, what can we do to prevent oxidative stress in the body so we can help heal the brain? \xa0 \xa0 1:24:43 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. Well, one component, when the symptoms have progressed to the point of tremor, I love hyperbaric oxygen, so I’ve to hyperbaric oxygen chambers here. So when it has progressed, so as a preventative component, which we all should be working towards preventative, is detoxing the body reducing oxidative stress, getting the antioxidants in there to repair from oxidative stress. You know, we’re exposed to 80,000 chemicals a week in the United States. And so there are levels of toxicity out there. So that we’ve got to just go on the offensive of just assume this is occurring. So what do I need to do to address it, and then reverse it? And so definitely not cooking with high heat, if you ever see the oil smoking in the pan, that means you’ve oxidized it. So, you know, kind of toss that out, start over, cook a little bit lower heat, quality of your oils that you’re using, what you’re cooking in. These things really do matter. Of course, the biggest lever is if you’re a smoker, stop smoking. If you grew up with smokers, you know if your parents smoked, like mine in the 70s. And you know, riding in the car with the windows up with mom smoking in the car, it’s like, “Oh, geez, what are we doing here?” That’s where the cadmium comes from, right? That’s where a lot of metal toxicity comes from, is that inhaled smoke. So you know, it’s really knowing where you grew up what you got exposed to, and then how to detox that? Infrared saunas, salt baths, grounding activity, deep breathing, mindfulness, meditation, all of these things do play a role there when you’re talking about oxidative stress. You know, in Environmental Medicine, the first thing you learn, the first six items are, the first three are remove, remove, remove, and then it says magnesium, magnesium, magnesium. So when you’re talking about environmental causative agents, you first have to stop the damage. So if there’s anything that you’re consuming, or around that’s creating oxidative stress or damage, which we know just in general life living, we’re getting exposed to stuff. So we’ve got to address that. And then we’ve got to make sure we’ve got all of the nutrients for our body to detox and magnesium is a big cofactor. There are a lot of other nutrients in there. But you know, you look at the cytochrome P450 cycle, and that’s in liver detoxification, major filter for the body. So getting the nutrients to keep those doors open is the way that I like to talk about that. B vitamins, magnesium are the big players there to keep the phase one and phase two route of elimination, open in the liver, sweating, motion activity, getting your circulation going, those things count, and then really your proper nutrition. That’s the setup for healthy living and longevity or the health span that I see working for a lot of people. Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:28:05 Ashley James:\xa0I love it. I had a problem for many years. So I don’t know if you know my story. But in my 20s was very, very sick. I had uncontrolled type two diabetes, chronic adrenal fatigue, chronic monthly infections, which I was on almost constant antibiotics for, and I was a mess. I had infertility, and I had polycystic ovarian syndrome, I was told I’d never have kids by an Endocrinologist. So I was just a mess. And the MDs want to put me on lots of drugs. And my 30s I spent building my body backup, I’m almost 40. Now at 39 and a half, I’m sort of like accepting my fate. I’m going to be 40 soon I know, I’ve psychologically had to like start preparing myself for the transition into my awesome 40s. And so I was able to with Natural Medicine, had a Naturopath mentor me. And so the last seven years of actually work with clients, you know, working with these Naturopaths and doing this health coaching. But it all started about 10 years ago, shopping the perimeter of the grocery store, only buying organic, you know, cutting out sugar and flour, going gluten free, dairy free, going on a whole food plant based diet. So you know, stopping eating at McDonald’s basically. I think I haven’t eaten McDonalds in eight or 10 years. But I basically went from the standard American diet to a really good diet and taking these supplements, you know, changing, doing emotional healing and mindset, everything, everything. And I was able to reverse all these problems. But every time I went to lose weight, I’d wake up in the morning, I taste metal and I would smell putrid. And it was like burning rubber. I would smell burning rubber and I would taste heavy metal, I would taste like metal in my mouth. And my liver would get super inflamed. Like all my liver enzymes were like super elevated, my liver was just pissed off. And I went for ultrasounds and they’re like, yep, that’s a really big liver, it was very inflamed. And so I’d stop weight loss. And then everything would go back to normal. That was really frustrating. And I would do it again and again, I went to lose a bit more weight. After about 20 pounds it all come up, come back and I’d have to stop weight loss. And it finally clicked, it finally dawned on me that it was the whatever junk like heavy metals was in my adipose tissue, my fat cells that when my body started releasing the fat, my liver just couldn’t handle it. And whether I mean, I have MTHFR like 25% on each end. So you know, there’s a little bit of gunk there, where my body needs a bit of help with methylation. But there was something definitely going on. And so I looked into how do I detox these heavy metals? How do I support my liver? I got a Sunlighten Sauna. It’s been just over a year. And I started sweating almost every day. Then I found a magnesium soak where your body actually absorbs grams of magnesium. And you can watch, like if you do the magnesium RBC blood test, you can watch it go up through soaking. And those two things shifted my whole world. It was amazing. So definitely, I attest to the fact that magnesium and sweating and an infrared sauna play a huge role in detoxification. I’ve done a bunch of other stuff as well that I’ve noticed changes, but those are probably the two biggest ones for me that I saw huge, huge changes. And now when I lose weight, I don’t have that liver problem, which is really exciting. It took me a whole year of getting in the sauna and soaking in magnesium and doing all all like I said, all the other kinds of stuff. But now I don’t have that problem. So you know, we have to advocate for ourselves. We have to educate ourselves, we have to listen to our body and get really curious like what’s going on? Why is my body doing this? And then go to a wonderful doctor like you that’ll help us decipher the language our bodies trying to speak. \xa0 \xa0 1:32:18 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Perfect. \xa0 \xa0 1:32:19 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, awesome. So on your website, you have a summit that people can access if they have Parkinson’s or if they have neurological issues that they really want to learn more about how they can support themselves and they can go to\xa0www.naturecuresclinic.com. Tell us a bit about your website, and what kind of resources are available on it? \xa0 \xa0 1:32:44 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Well, I have two handouts on there. One is four signs of cognitive decline, and that’s the one that you can access through, you’ll get some more information around the Parkinson’s summit that I’m holding, interviewed seven experts in different facets of care for neurodegeneration and have had some really great feedback from folks and appreciation and just assembling this information for them. And then the other guide that I have is on pain and pain management. So the part of the Regenerative Medicine and regenerative stem cell therapies is it’s really renowned for regrowing joints; knees and hips and backs and brains and so I’ve got a guide on there as well, if you’ve got anybody that’s listening with pain or pain patterns, that is up on the site as well. \xa0 \xa0 1:33:38 Ashley James:\xa0Very cool. Awesome and then people can work with you as well,\xa0www.naturecuresclinic.com. But if they want to come to you in Portland, tell us a bit about, what was this camp you have? \xa0 \xa0 1:33:49 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Oh, yeah. So I call it Camp Nature Cures. And so, I do have people fly in from around the globe. You know Portland is a destination city now for food and culture, it’s a really fun place to be. So, it’s kind of on the radar, but then we also have our Nature Cares Clinic. We’re right downtown at 10th and Taylor right next to the library and centrally located and we plug people into great restaurants and the arts etc. But you know, you come out for intensive, so I’ve had folks fly in from as far away as New Zealand at this point. And we’ll set people up with brain regenerative program. It’s a 10 day program, people come in for a battery of tests and treatments we’re doing stem cell regenerative therapies, acupuncture, Chinese herbs, we get them in the hyperbaric chamber twice a day. So three hours a day of hyperbarics, we’re doing the IVs that help heal the body, they deal with that oxidative stress that you were talking about with the brain and you know really help the body. We give the body all of the information it needs to heal itself. So folks come in and coming into Camp Nature Cures because these therapies we can’t deliver them online energetically, yet. We’re looking for that thought, quantum physics and that increased curve that’s happening. But for now, we deliver them in person here at the clinic. Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 1:35:32\xa0 Ashley James:\xa0I love Portland for the food scene as well. But I’m looking for the vegan and raw vegan. I get so excited. Like, yeah, let’s go to a raw vegan restaurant. And I have a raw vegan friend that used to live in Portland and he’d brag about the raw vegan scene and I’m pretty jazzed about all the healthy food that’s available\xa0 at Portland, but they do have bacon doughnuts that aren’t vegan. \xa0 \xa0 1:36:00 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yes. \xa0 \xa0 1:36:00 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, they do have a lot of other kinds of foods in Portland. Well, very cool. I’m super excited that we were able to bring this information today and you’re welcome back on the show anytime because you can teach about allergies and asthma and orthopedics. I’d love to have you back on the show to dive into those topics as well. \xa0 \xa0 1:36:23 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Oh, that would be awesome. Thank you so much. \xa0 \xa0 1:36:25 Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, absolutely. Very cool. Is there anything left unsaid that you want to make sure that you convey before wrapping up today’s interview? \xa0 \xa0 1:36:34 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Yeah. You know, one of the big things that is a message of mine and just what I’ve been through is, it’s about love and you know, just if you haven’t, we want to spread more love and tell those around that you love them and give them big hugs and you know really look in their eyes, because we don’t know how long we’re on the planet together and it’s such a special time to have and kind of a sacred time. So, just the message of I would love to see more love out there, and so it starts with us and just go hug some people, your loved ones and make sure they know that you love them. \xa0 \xa0 1:37:16 Ashley James:\xa0That’s beautiful. Thank you so much Dr. Greg Eckel. It has been such a pleasure having you here today. listeners can go to your website\xa0www.naturecuresclinic.com. Of course that link will be in the show notes for today’s podcast at\xa0www.learntruehealth.com\xa0and they can check out all those freebie, wonderful information that you’re giving away. Absolutely. They should sign up on your website to get more information from you. They should come visit Camp Nature Cures and some awesome fun treatments. And of course they can call you up and have a Zoom call with you over the internet. It’s been great having you here. Can’t wait to have you back on the show. \xa0 \xa0 1:37:56 Dr. Greg Eckel:\xa0Thank you so much, Ashley. \xa0 \xa0 — \xa0 Outro: \xa0 Eyeing to optimize your health?

Diet, rest, exercise, stress reduction and supplements can play a big role too. Listen to today’s podcast and listen to what Reed Davis has to say about things that you should know about to help you to optimize your health and your way to functional nutrition. \xa0 [0:00] Ashley James:\xa0Hello, True Health seekers and welcome to another exciting episode of Learn True Health podcast. I’m very excited for you to hear our interview today with Reed Davis, the founder of Functional Diagnostic Nutrition.\xa0 A few months ago, I interviewed one of his graduates who practice as a health coach with this unique ability to do functional lab testing and then help their clients to find those healing opportunities that the labs present. It’s a different philosophy. A different lens that these health coaches look through to see how they can best serve their clients to finally resolve the metabolic chaos that’s been going on. We often treat symptoms and our medical system even someone has a thyroid condition for example and they think that that’s the root cause and so they’re treating the thyroid but thyroid dysfunction covers from something else. What causes the thyroid to have a dysfunction? And there are dozens of root causes. Functional Diagnostic Nutrition looks to solve that. Today we’re going to dive into what is Functional Diagnostic Nutrition and how can it help you to achieve the best health possible. Those who are already health coaches or in the holistic health field you’re going to love learning about Reed’s program. He has a wonderful online certification program where he teaches you how to do these labs. How to interpret them and how to then help the clients to get the results we’re looking for through lifestyle, diet and when needed, supplementation. If you’re not in the holistic health space and you’re not interested in making a career in helping people like becoming a health coach, you will still enjoy today’s interview because he does teach a lot of wonderful things. He’s told me that some people even take his course just to learn these tools for themselves which I thought was very valuable. After interviewing him, I enrolled in his program and I jumped in and I’m already in module two and I’m loving it. I’m absolutely loving it. I’m learning so much. What I really like about his program is it’s all “rubber hits the road.” There’s no fluff. You jump straight in and you begin learning. I’ve been studying with Naturopaths and doctors and reading tons of books and going to health lectures and obviously doing 300 interviews with doctors and in my first few days of being in his course I have learned stuff I have never heard off before. It’s really exciting. If you’re a health coach I hugely recommend checking out his course because as you know I’m a health coach, I’ve been doing this for several years. I’ve always felt that there’s a piece missing. This piece of looking at things objectively through the lens of proper labs. Reed talks about this today in the show. You’re going to really like the kinds of labs that he does. It’s not the kind of labs that you’re ever used to going to your doctor. These are totally different and it allows us to see where the metabolic chaos is. In some cases, actually, let us find the root cause but regardless of whether we find the root cause or not, they will allow us to see what we need to see in order to make the appropriate changes to support the body in coming back into balance. That’s very exciting. Enjoy today’s interview and please, check out the link.\xa0Learntruehealth.com/FDN. \xa0As in Functional Diagnostic Nutrition. That’s\xa0Learntruehealth.com/FDN. Excellent. Enjoy today’s interview. \xa0 \xa0 [04:01] Ashley James:\xa0Welcome to the Learn True Health podcast. I’m your host, Ashley James. This is episode 376. I’m very excited for today’s guest, we have with us, Reed Davis. He’s the founder of Functional Diagnostic Nutrition. An amazing company that helps people to become certified in functional nutrition. I definitely want to dive into that because we have a lot of health coaches that listen and this is a wonderful adjunct to those who are in the holistic health space or for people who want to get into the holistic health space, it’s a wonderful course that they can take. For those who aren’t, who just want to get their own health back and that’s why they’re listening. This episode is also perfect for you because we’re going to be talking about lab testing and the things that you should know about to help you to optimize your health. The things that going to a mainstream medical doctor, practitioner they just wouldn’t know to provide you and so Reed’s going to enlighten us today. Reed, welcome to the show. \xa0 [05:09] Reed Davis:\xa0Welcome. Thanks so much for having me here Ashley. It’s a real pleasure. Looking forward to trying to help some people. \xa0 [05:16] Ashley James:\xa0 Before we get started, you were telling me a bit about where you live which is a paradise up in the mountains. You’re living off a grid and you’re using a satellite phone. So far the connection’s been wonderful and every time we hear a little bit of a delay on the line we’ll just remember that you’re living in absolute paradise on a lake in the mountains. Totally off the grid and we so appreciate that you’re taking the time to educate us today. \xa0 [05:45] Reed Davis:\xa0Thanks again. I’m happy to answer anything I can. Tell you the history. It’s about helping people and trying to walk the talk. I’m here for you and your pleasure. \xa0 [05:57] Ashley James:\xa0Absolutely. I’d love to start by hearing your story. You are a certified nutritional therapist. You’re a holistic health practitioner. You founded this wonderful company that helps people to learn how they can do these lab tests for themselves and for their clients. Then what to do once they have the lab results, which I think the most important thing about. Right? It’s good to have the lab testing but then what do we do? Okay, so now I see that my liver enzymes are high but what do we do? You have wonderful course that helps people to learn functional nutrition. How did you start? What happened in your life that lead you to want to do this? \xa0 [06:41] Reed Davis:\xa0Yes. Thanks so much. It’s an amazing course in lab work and natural protocols to fix what you find. But it was a long time coming. Back in the 90s, I was doing environmental law. I came out of a law program at the University of San Diego. Went right to work saving the planet, birds, bees, air, water, trees. What can we do to clean up the planet and it’s very rewarding work. Frankly, I made millions of dollars for the owners but not for myself. As I increase therapist, my income didn’t grow up that much and southern California’s a very expensive place to live. So I was looking around for a way where I could be my own boss, work for myself but also continue the work. I turned my attention from saving the planet to people like what’s this environment if it’s killing off the bird and bees and air and water and trees and things. What’s it doing to people including myself? What’s it doing to me? I’m getting older too right? Back then I was probably in my 40s but I was again working hard and I went to work, changed jobs. I went to work at a clinic. It’s a wellness clinic or a wellness center in Southern California in San Diego area. It’s beautiful. People were lovely. I was really hired to run the business and help expand the business. But the owner who was a chiropractor. She allowed me to go with her kind of as an assistant. She was getting a diploma in nutrition for her chiropractic work. And said, “Hey, you can come along and you can get certified too.” Not a physician but I did that. This was remarkable, Ashley. You’ll love this. She let me work in her patients in between classes. I’d go into a lesson. Let’s say in detoxification come back and I had access to her patients to talk to them about their health and find out what’s going on and see if I can help them with this training that I was getting. I’ve had many other trainings since was you mentioned. Kind of been a certificate collector of sorts. I think everyone listening probably will see this in a way a learn freak. Just never satisfied with what you know. I know there’s a deeper layer. There’s something else I can learn. I was like that too but also, in the clinic, this is remarkable. Again, I had the ability to help clients and I fell in love with that side of it. I turn my attention instead of just running the clinic and helping to grow and things like that but I still had to do that but I fell in love with the clinical side that means working face to face with people. One of the things I noticed right away was that almost everybody walking to the door for their pain or whatever it was, they had multiple complaints and they’ve been to multiple practitioners trying to get some resolution or solutions to their problem. Some of them 10 doctors already. That just blew my mind. Even though I was neophyte that was 20 years ago, I said to myself and to them even ”Look, I’m going to be the last person you need to see. We’re going to figure this out.” I’ve been very good that the legal research and writing and I could understand fairly complex things and try to make it easy for people. That was another part of my job at that time we’ll just call it patient educator. I got to look at very complex things break it down and try to explain it people so that they could go out and do the things that took to get well. I could just again, very fortunate with the stars lined up or whatever you want to put it. I met doctors who are running alternative lab work. Back then, 20 years ago, there was just standard medicine and alternative also known as quackery. Some of these doctors, I’ve learned from were not very low respected at that time. They were pioneering doing really important work especially with some of the labs that were coming out. The saliva testing, the urine testing, the stool testing. Things I would say above and beyond normal blood chemistry. Some of these people come in and they’re really sick. They just feel lousy all that time. Things about the way they look and the way they feel that they’re not happy with. Their physicians were saying, “Your bloodwork looks normal. Everything looks fine. You’re just getting old.” Or you’ve heard that before, right? \xa0 [11:28] Ashley James:\xa0Right. We’ll definitely get into this. Like what is normal? because they’re waiting until you’re in a disease state so they can give you a drug. If you’re unhealthy but you’re not yet sick enough not to be put on a drug to manage the disease, then they’re going to tell you that you’re fine. That’s if you go to a mainstream medical doctor. \xa0 [11:54] Reed Davis:\xa0Right. You’re considered by them to be sub-clinical. You haven’t reached that point where your bloodwork looks so out of whack that they can diagnose you. This is another the beauty of our work. I’ve been doing this for 20 years, Ashley. There is no medical diagnosis or treatment for that specific thing. Just for feeling lousy and you’re overweight and you’re tired or maybe there’s stuff going on with your sinuses, allergies, moodiness, irritability, digestive problem and all these things but you’re not at that point where you need to be referred to a gastroenterologist there’s something in a way standard measure. Back to the story, I’m seeing people in the office now, I started going into the public and recruiting. I bought a bone density testing machine. I started doing that two days a week. Clinic was open Monday, Wednesday, Friday and I work very hard. I do 12-14 hours a day easily or to a lot of weekends. A couple of days a week. I would go out and for 5 years, I’m going to go twice a week to these grocery stores. Some small chain about 30 stores. I would just go from one to the next, test people for their bone density and this is mostly women between I’d say 40 and 60 because that’s who gets checked and they’re getting early checks. I’d get certified in that part to use that machine kind of radiology limited tech certificate and I was doing this testing and then I was helping those women with that problem like they had low bone density and I got into the hormones and the immune systems and digest and detoxification. I learned how to run the labs. Again, I was very fortunate to be working with some physicians who let me run labs under their license as their protégé is you will. Actually as their alter ego because their licensure restricted them from what they could do let’s say for a person. This is still happening today that it- yes, you’re laughing but even just last week I was [Inaudible 13:58] I was at Medfit tour at the Washington athletic club in Seattle. I was speaking to a group up there about a hundred personal trainers and some physicians and one physician said, “I feel like my medical license are handcuffs. I’m just about ready to give up my license because I want to do what’s really right for people.” 20 years ago, it was worse. Doctors were just tied up to these model of diagnose-treat-diagnose-treat. Very small specific thing. It’s almost always it’s writing a prescription. I was actually like an alter ego. I got to say to these people anything. Forget the diagnosis, what’s really wrong. Again the saliva testing, urine testing, stool testing, looking at hormone, immune, digestion, detoxification, energy production, and autonomic balance. The sympathetic para-sympathetic. I ran thousands of those labs on thousands of people. Mostly women because that seem most interested but then when we got some good results and actually some miracle cases early on. Just unbelievable things happened that told me I was on the right track. Then they would refer, they bring in their husbands, they bring in their kids. If you want I could tell you a quick story about an early case that gave me tremendous faith and hope and belief in what I was doing. A lady comes into the chiropractic office and you know, I would walk the patients back to the treatment room. I was also trained, took a course in Myo-fascia release. I could do a specialized trigger point therapy on their necks and upper shoulders and things before they got their chiropractic adjustment. One day I was taken aback and I could just tell she as not feeling right, she was depressed and I asked what’s wrong.\xa0 She said, “Reed, it’s this weight. This 40 pounds and I’m really depressed about it.” “What are you doing?” “Well, I can’t do anything because I’m on this medication for the hives. It was a steroid that makes me fat. So I talked to my doctor yesterday” and she said, “he said, Lady, you have your choice. you’re going to be overweight or you’re going to have the hives. Take your pick.” So yes, you can imagine. She’s just distraught. She said, “And I told him that was really depressing and he offered me to write a prescription for anti-depressants.” \xa0 [16:27] Ashley James:\xa0 Oh, of course! \xa0 [16:29] Reed Davis:\xa0Yes. So check this out. Again, this is a long time ago. I didn’t know really exactly I was doing. I was learning but I didn’t know I was doing but I was doing awfully a lot too. I said, “Susan, did anyone ever try to find out why you get the hives?” Her neck just about snapped, her head just about snapped out of her neck. You know she was, “Well, what do you mean”?” I said, “There’s a test you can find out. Are you sensitive to something? Is there something in your environment? There’s all kind of ways to investigate that. That’s what I do. I’m like a health detective.” She goes, ”No. No one’s ever mentioned that.” Anyway, to get to the chase, we get her take home some test kits. Found out that some things she was very sensitive to, got her off of those things. Mostly dietary and within two weeks, she was off her medication and she told her doctor, “I’m never going back on it again”. I found what the problem is and I’m avoiding it. Then 2 weeks after that she was off her medication. She was doing two things that she hadn’t done in a couple of years. One was take a hot shower because even on the meds she got the hives. The other is working out to the point of perspiration because even on the meds she got the hives. It completely changed her life. She became a happy person. She started losing weight. She started feeling like her old self. Now I have to add that there’s some other labs and the hormones and immune and digestion. There a lot of things you could tune up on a person. That just told me then that I was on the right track. So many stories like that where early on I did not know at all but I was figuring out a system of investigation. Where to look for these underlying causes and conditions instead of, “Here’s something for the hives and the depressants because you’ve gained 40 pounds. Here’s something for the depression.” It’s such a contrast as you will know. \xa0 [18:36] Ashley James:\xa0I love it. That was your early on experience which got you so excited about helping people that you were shocked to find out that when people go to their mainstream doctor, they wait until they’re sick, put them on a drug and then when they have a side effect. They put them on another drug for the side effect and so on and so forth. Instead of trying to figure out how to solve it. If we look back at the history of allopathic medicine, about a 150 years ago and start to look back to the beginning of what is now MD medicine. Right? If we look at the history we see that. This is not conspiracy theory. This is fact. We see that a large, a person, it was Carnegie who owned a pharmaceutical company is that one that invested in making sure that the education, he invested in all the universities that taught medical doctors to only teach basically how to prescribe drugs. To this day, the education of doctors is largely manipulated by the pharmaceutical companies. They don’t want doctors to learn how to get to the root cause of chronic illness. I love allopathic medicine for emergencies, for some surgeries, when it’s necessary especially emergency medicine. For some infections, that’s where they shine but take a chronic illness to an MD their wheelhouse, their toolset is drugs that manage symptoms not most of them not getting to the root cause especially when it comes to more sensitive tests like you said. Things like food sensitivities or understanding genetics, understanding diet and nutrition. They don’t have an education around that. Unfortunately, they have a hubris, not all of them but some of them have a hubris to assume that they know everything about health because they paid so much for their education, right? I have had a few MDs on the show who said to me, “I really thought I know everything.” And they really do. They think they know everything so when you come to them with hives, they don’t question what’s causing the hives. They just assume, “Okay, you have hives. You’re just going to have for the rest of your life, here’s a drug,” Same with my type II diabetes. I had polycystic ovarian syndrome and infertility all the problems I had all that. All the MDs told me was that we can manage it with drugs and I would be that way for the rest of my life and I will never have kids. I told you before we hit record because you asked me about my personal story but it was because I veered off and started to look for holistic solutions that I was able to resolve all of them. All of the things that the MDs said were my life sentences basically. I love that early on, you saw that there’s a huge need for functional diagnostic nutrition. What happened next? You were having these aha moments. Moments when you’re working with the clients in the clinic. What lead you to want to start functional diagnostic nutrition? \xa0 [21:11] Reed Davis:\xa0Yes, sure. You know I want to just follow up a bit on what you said first. The fact that allopathic physicians, they’re the best at what they do. They want to help it. They save lives every single day. If you get off of a plane from West Africa and your temperature is 106 and you’re bleeding out of your eyeballs or something. You don’t call your nutritionist, you go for the best standard care you possibly can find. The hospitals and doctors are full of people who could really help you at that point. Same thing if you have a car accident and your bone is sticking out of your arm bleeding. You don’t call your health coach and have it fixed, it’s so fantastic at that right? Really keep those things in mind. The next thing for me was just the sheer grind. I was just grinding for years? I didn’t stop to think about what kind of a big movement I could start or something like that. I was really enjoying myself. Earning a very good living. Building one of the busiest, we’ll call it a nutrition practice in the country, in the US. Again at San Diego. I was just doing my thing. Working in the office, really helping all the patients that were coming in. Learning how to teach them, how to educate them in plain English on the things that they could do. Which really in the big concept in the chiropractic office and wellness center. We had other doctors. Acupuncturist, we even had an osteopath but it’s not what you do in the office, its what you do at home in between office visits. That’s when I because an expert at. At least a guy with a plan, a guy with a system because it was all based on observation. If you run thousands of labs on thousands of people, you’re going to learn a few things. What I learned is where the alternative practitioners of the day we’re leaving planks. There are this gaps in person with a health problem. There are gaps. It’s called the cycle of trial and error actually. You go to a physician he says, “All your bloodwork looks normal” or even if he says, “It looks abnormal” the answer’s just a prescription to treat the paper in most. Thyroids a perfect example. “You have a cluster of symptom sounds like thyroid.” so they run a thyroid test. Yep, pat myself in the back. “You have hyperthyroid. Here’s your medication.” It traces the paper definitely, they can adjust the doses to get the numbers on the paper that look like what they want. That doesn’t make the person any better. It’s treating the test results and the symptoms, not the person. The best blessing I had was not being able to write a prescription. Not being a doctor. You know at first I thought, I should be a doctor so I can help these people. No. Grinding it out for years and years in the office, running to labs to figure out what’s really wrong and then how to fix it. What does that person need to go home and do in between doctors’ visits? I came up with that DRESS for health success system. The D-R-E-S-S. We can get it into that what that is, that’s the lifestyle medicine that there’s now band-aid about by lots of pundits. People who might have come and got training in something. Even people that take my course, they’re much better educated once they’re done but grinning it out being on the discovery levels was happy days. Just working hard. You asked, how to finally turn that into FDN. I was out lecturing not only doing my screenings with the bone density machines. I invented other screening just to get people and get them doing some lab work. Get them running some saliva and urine testing which is easy to take home. It’s not expensive and everyone can do it, so anyone can run these labs. Getting information, identifying, this is the key phrase. Healing opportunities like what’s really wrong. Again if you’re hormone balance, if you’re not breaking down assimilating food very well if your liver is congested, you won’t be detoxifying your body and on and on. If the immune system is overactive or underactive. These are not medical diagnosis they’re just identifying healing opportunities, things that a person can fix. Of course, it isn’t but one of the trainings I took taught us to substitute drugs with supplements. I tried that for a while and that didn’t work. It’s much more than just a naturopathic medicine should be much more than just “Here’s the test, here’s the wrong in the paper, here’s some supplements that can fix it.” versus “Here’s some drugs that’ll fix it.” That’s not what would work for me. Again, the whole entire lifestyle medicine thing. I started figuring out how do I know what is the right diet for everybody. Everyone has to eat. You’re made of food. I used to weigh 8 pounds when I was born now I weigh 198 pounds pretty big guy. Where that extra weight come from?\xa0 It came from food. You ate food and it built the body. So that’s really important. Then also, rest or sleep but rest, knowing how to really get good deep non-realm rest is critical to having a healthy body. Then the exercise, I became a personal fitness trainer and all of that learning about the physical body. Then, of course, another letter is – so that’s Diet, Rest, Exercise, D-R-E-S-S, it spells DRESS for health success. Diet, rest, exercise, stress reduction and then, of course, the supplements. I put supplements last. They’re what people want to start with but I don’t really believe that. They’re important but it’s really the D, the R and the E and the first S, stress reduction. You’ve heard that word stress before, right? You probably don’t have any but there’s so many different kinds. I learned about stress. A matter fact I read in 2001, in an article in a naturopathic medicine that that was responsible for 50% of office visits and up to 80% of chronic degenerative disease. Some form of stress. I looked into different types of stress. Mental, emotional, physical trauma and of course, what I specialize in, is the environmental and the biological biochemical stressors, chemical stressors. It’s really a holistic lifestyle program that was developed over years of working with people, finding out what works how do you customize it. Based upon the actual healing opportunities that I discovered with the labs. If you run thousands of labs in thousands of people and you pay attention, I made observations on who got better and who didn’t. It should be no surprise to anyone listening, those people who worked closest to the underlying cause were the ones who got better but it was not so intuitive. This is where it kind of takes the twist where you really have to be observant is people with the exact same set of symptoms can have them for completely different upstream dysfunction. One person with the thyroid disorder where they’re hypothyroid, whereas their thyroids not making enough T4 or is making T4 but was not converting into T3 properly. Those are basics. Why? Instead of just giving them medication, we want to know why. What I’ve discovered in 10 people, you might find 10 different reasons why. That’s the not so intuitive part that helped me developed functional diagnostic nutrition, the entire program. Which is the investigation, which labs were on? Which observations can be capitalized on. We’re going to make some observations about healing opportunities as long as we’re given time, we can capitalize on those. Again, if you have a temperature of a 106 and you’re bleeding out of all references, don’t call me. Go get checked out first. If you have a big, blood’s on your forehead like some tumor growing. That needs a more attendant care, \xa0emergency care. You go get that handled but then what? You come back and we do a program for you. This holistic functional diagnostic nutrition and the Dress For Health success program. That took a lot of years. \xa0 [31:27] Ashley James:\xa0Very cool. As you developed this, did you see when you applied DRESS, the Dress For Health success to everyone that you got even better results? \xa0 [31:42] Reed Davis:\xa0Well, yes. Today, 11 years ago I was asked to teach the system. It wasn’t good enough for one guy in California to be using it. How many people could I actually serve? Again, I had one of the busiest practices in the country. I was told that by my vendors. The people that I did business with especially a couple of the laboratories. They said, “Who the hell are you? No one does this much lab work.” If this was on the doctor’s office and there’s five doctors working there, “Who are you again? You’re a nutritionist? You’re doing all these lab work?” Well yes, I did it actually because I didn’t know you can’t do it. [Laughter] Like, “You can’t do that. Who are you? You can’t do that.” and I just would explain how hard I’d like to work and the number of people and the system I was developing. Finally, it’s became time to start chasing it to other practitioners. I started deputizing with just about anyone at first. There’s a lot of they didn’t call them health coaches back then now there’s a lot medical health coaches, I think we’re pioneer in that area because they’re allied practitioner we’re not medical doctors for the most part. We have personal trainers and people who do raki and nutrition and dietitians and nurses and physical therapist and you just name it, chiropractors, acupuncture. Basically not MDs. What they want to focus on is underlying causes and conditions. Ashley, really quickly we’re talking about the history. It’s really important. In 1903, Thomas Edison said a very famous quote from the great inventor who was right about a lot of things but he was wrong about this and I see people using this quote all over the place it says, “The doctor of the future would give no medicine. But will interest his patients instead in care of the human frame in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.” What is wrong? Doctors are still giving medicine. It’s 113 years later? When is the future? If it’s not now, when is it? If physicians are still giving medicine, who then is going to interest the person in the care of the human frame in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease? It’s health coaches and allied practitioners. We’re the ones. We’re the army if you will saying, give the care of disease to physicians. We freely grant them full monopoly. We don’t care about disease, you’re the experts. You studied disease. You studied symptoms that might kill someone. That’s a good thing. They can do stuff that I can’t do. I can’t order a CT scan to see if you have tumors and other great things that they can do. Although some of that is a big waste of money. I had client once who, I mentioned to her she was going to take that supplement. There’s possibility of that you might get a little bit of vasodilator headache. You might get some headaches if you take too much of this stuff. So back off you go back down to the original dosage and things like that. About 3 weeks later, I’m talking to her and she goes, “I’m going in for a brain scan from my headaches.” I go, “what?” she goes, ”I called my doctor and I told him I’ve been having headaches for three weeks, she wants to give me a brain scan.” I said, “Well okay, if three weeks, how long have you been taking that supplement that I suggested to take?” she said, “About 3 weeks.” Doctors look for brain tumors or things and we work in different ways. I think you get the point I’m trying to make. It’s good to get your brain scan I guess. I can’t order that test but it’s good to have a doctor around who’s licensed to do that but we look for things in a different way. What are the healing opportunities, it’s a different set of labs. \xa0 [36:11]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0\xa0It’s a different philosophy. You’re looking at that through a different lens right? Looking for the healing opportunities and doctors are looking for what drugs can I prescribe. That’s their toolset. It’s a different philosophy. \xa0 [36:25] Reed Davis:\xa0It’s totally different. Again, back to this idea that there’s gaps. People are caught in a cycle of trial and error. There isn’t enough health coaches and allied practitioners around. The purpose and the fact that the populations getting more unhealthy. Drug uses getting more rampant. We have people being advertised to and television. Going to the doctors and saying, “Hey, I want to try these medication for whatever.” The doctor is they’re kind of market followers. “Well like, okay.” They’re trying to meet the demand. They wouldn’t just indiscriminately do it but you get the point I’m trying to make. We see the health of people getting worse. A doctor I was talking to, a good guy, he said to me, ”Reed, you know we’re ranked 38.” He goes, “In terms of health, United States had ranked second from the bottom of 48 civilized countries or whatever. Like that.” We’re ranked second from the bottom. Why is that? \xa0 [37:42] Ashley James:\xa0But we spent the most as a country, we spend the most on, they call it health care but it’s disease management. Yet we are basically getting the word results. If it was a country, if we looked at each country like a company, like a business. Like Amazon as a business. If Amazon was spending the most amount of money, and getting the second to last worst results like in terms of sales retention whatever. They would fire the CEO immediately and completely restructure their business or they’d go out of business. But because it is a for-profit business, there’s no sense. They don’t want to change it because they’re profiting. They’ll say, you’ll see that statistic like if you’re a type I diabetic or if you’re an insulin-dependent type II diabetic, they’ll say the cost to be a diabetic is $12,500 on average per person per year. They make it sound like it’s a cost to the country. Its cost but in fact, it’s profit. A diabetic is profiting the industry that doesn’t serve us that is not getting results. Why would they want to change? They’re profiting? Right? But we are the people as individual we are the ones getting screwed over because we’re getting the second to least results compared to all the other countries but we could go to a different country, spend less on health but you know that would go costly to fly or drive to a different country depending on where you live. Here we are. We’re stuck. But we have to do something different, right? We don’t want to leave the country we’re in for health care although some people do called medical tourism. So here we are. We have to understand that the system we have gets the second to worst results yet we pay the most for it. We have to understand that we’re stuck with that system but we’re not stuck with needing to go to an MD for absolutely everything. We have to understand like you pointed out, wonderful people to go to for certain things and for healing opportunities go to an allied practitioner like a health coach or naturopathic chiropractor. I don’t know about calling a Naturopath an allied practitioner because they’re legitimate doctors but they see it through a different lens. Going to someone other than a doctor that’s just going to prescribe drugs. We need to take our health into our own hands. That’s why the listeners listening right now. So they can become educated and they can be highly informed and advocate for their own health. I will say one final thing on this, I say it often but we have new listeners all the time. As I’ve done all these interviews which I’ve done over 370 interviews for the last few years, it dawned on me somewhere along the line that if you want to be a statistic, do what everyone else is doing. The statistics right now, I believe it’s 1 of 3 people would get a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime. One in 3 people are obese. Or you know, overweight in an unhealthy way. One in 3 people have diabetes or pre-diabetic. And then you look at heart disease. My dad died of heart disease. My mom died of cancer so both two topics close to my heart. That we can help the listeners prevent it. Heart diseases is 100% reversible and preventable. I interviewed Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn a cardiologist who’s in his 80s who still practices today helping people reverse heart disease with diet. The point in this is that we could take action but we have to remember that we need to be summoned swimming upstream if we do what everyone else is doing, we’re going to be statistic. We have to be a little bit controversial. Right? Go get some lab tests done that a regular doctor would scoff at maybe. Change your diet, change your lifestyle. Look at that stress. Look at exercise. Look at all the things that the average person doesn’t in order to live along healthy life without disease. I’m so glad you’re going to outline some great actionable steps we can take today, you created the DRESS for success system to help people see that there are pillars of health that they could take into their own hands every day. To build their health and then using the abs, you look for healing opportunities to target what the body is saying it needs to focus on. \xa0 [43:23] Reed Davis:\xa0Exactly. That was a mouthful and very good. You were a change maker. Someone’s going to help change this system. Let’s just say the two systems can both exist. Again, it’s not like a wave to eliminated allopathic medicine we just can let that team have control over everything and us because they will just make us consume. We’re just going to be consumers of their stuff. The province of Ontario, we’re both from Ontario right? in Canada. I heard statics recently in the last couple of years, by 2020 60% of the entire Ontario government’s budget. 60% of the budget will go to healthcare. By 2025 or somewhere in there, another 10 years, maybe 20 30 even it will be 80% of the entire government’s budget will just go towards healthcare. Now everybody’s going to be on a the medical dole if you will. Just for all the money’s going to go. It’s a system where you’re right, there is greed and a lot of profit motivation for this. The people who are in the receiving end of the check, like government’s writing the check, who’s getting the check? Who’s getting paid? We want to change people’s thinking. I also just want to throw in that what we do is for profit also. I learned to make a living helping people. It’s an honest living though. It’s doing work, it’s very rewarding that does some good in the world. It will be a legacy, it will be passed on. You and I are of the same elk we’re working together to affect those kind of change and you don’t do it by going along with the pack. You do it by doing somewhat controversial. At least, can’t I ask some questions? Like if you go to a physician, he says, “Yes. I found your problem. You’re hypothyroid that why you’re tired and constipated and gaining weight and can’t lose it, your hairs falling out and you feel sad. It’s hypothyroid. Here’s your medication.” If you say that, “Doctor, why is my thyroid underactive?” We don’t know it’s idiopathic. When you hear that word, idiopathic means, it means they’re not looking for the answer. It really means, “We don’t know but it means we’re not looking because that’s not how they operate. It isn’t by the way just the drug companies, it’s insurance companies play a huge part in it. That goes back to original comments Ashley about physicians feel like they’re wearing handcuffs. They can’t say anything else. They get reprimanded by their board. If they’re selling supplements, their office are doing some of these things, alternative stuff insurance doesn’t pay for it. They can get a letter to cease and desist or we’ll take your license away. How many are brave enough to say, “Go ahead. Take it. I’m going to do some good in the world and you can keep it.” They’re not just brave at this point. There’s got to be another system not to replace it but to operate side by side that can end up being a bigger system. The one that the people choose when the people go to. I’ve been a working-class here all my whole life. I’ve always admired them anyway. I actually do right to Harley Davidson through the mountains of California at least three times a week and try to do some good in the world and enjoy the lives that walk the talk. I can’t say profits are a bad things I’m just saying you can make an honest living helping people if you want to. That’s a big part of my course is showing other people to of this as a profession. Most people would sign up to their own health and their families. They just want to learn, it’s very affordable. I do this post-grad interviews and I always ask every single graduate in my program I personally interview and I have for 11 years. I have done thousands of interviews that’s “Why did you take the FDN course? What did it meant to you?” Way more than half would say, 75% say, “My own personal health challenges have been completely resolved, partially resolved. I’m working on it. I’m on my journey I felt so much better. I can’t wait to share it with others. I’m going to go out there and now I’m going to do this for a living.” Or we’ve had people start their business, augment their business or shift from whatever they were doing for living to doing this for a living. It’s okay to make money, as long as you’re doing some good in the world in my opinion.\xa0 \xa0 [48:22] Ashley James:\xa0It is not evil. I want every single one of my listeners to live a life that they absolutely love and be well taken care of. To have the means to have the amount of money that provides them with the ability to live their dreams. Money is not evil, it’s what you do with it. You have to give your money, I just paid my bills today so I just paid our health insurance and we don’t buy the most expensive but we don’t buy the most cheap. I always buy the one that covers holistic medicine but we’re nowhere reaching our deductible because we obviously use it a bunch but we do go to our Naturopath, to our chiropractor, acupuncture. That kind of thing. It’s $1,500 a month for the three of us for our family. Last year it was a different plan, it was $1,800. I’m like every time I pay it, I just feel resentment. I feel frustrated. I think to myself why don’t I just not have health insurance and then just save some money or put aside then there’s all these diff options and I’m so obviously like I do the podcast and I’m a very hard worker and I get this podcast to help as many people as possible. That’s a huge percentage of our income goes towards medical expenses for a system that is broken. For a system that isn’t getting results. Right? If this system was designed, if every practitioner had your course, every practitioner in the entire world, even every MD knew what you taught and they practice what you taught, our medical bills would be so small it would save us so much money. Every time I pay it I feel resentful because I’m paying a system that doesn’t work. Now I absolutely have id be overjoyed to pay a functional medicine practitioner and I want them to profit because they get results. It’s about results. It’s evil when you have to give something or a company you have to pay some money to something that gets very poor results and you feel like you’re ripped off. It’s more about feeling ripped off whereas with functional diagnostic nutrition, I know it gets results. Just like seeing a Naturopath I know I’m going to get significantly better results than seeing an MD for certain issues. You want to go the right practitioner from the results you want. I think that’s just really important to understand that there are these allied practitioners out there. I’ve had listeners contact me that said, “I never knew that Naturopaths existed until I listen to your show.” They just didn’t know. Because that’s not part of the mainstream I guess, Hollywood right? And TV and media. The media we consume growing up is all about ER and Grey’s Anatomy and there’s no show following acupuncturists around. I think that’ll be hilarious. I definitely want to get into understanding a bit about the tests. That if you could give us some examples of lab tests that people when they take your course that they learn to order both for themselves and also for their clients and to just give us a contrast compared to like what someone would get when they go to an MD versus when they’re going to a functional diagnostic nutritionist? \xa0 [52:09] Reed Davis:\xa0Fantastic. The place to start the labs is how do you think about it? It’s really a state of mind or we call it FDN a methodology. Methodology is a method with a way of thinking attached to it. There’s a philosophy or a state of mind that’s required. Since for non-physician, we can’t diagnose and treat conditions. That would be practicing medicine without license. We don’t want to. We want to just get the underlying causes or conditions. They’re not always identifiable the so called root cause. You hear people talking about this. You may never find the root cause. It could be really well hidden or there just isn’t enough test. There’s no test that’s for sure. It’s not that this blood work that they’re running. We might be 50 or hundred years away to a blood test that tells you everything if it ever happens. We’re definitely not in a land of Star Trek where I don’t know if you remember Dr. Macoy had that little thing and he would wave it over the patient’s chest and then “Oh, it’s this or that here’s your shot of whatever” and that was really allopathic even though it was supposed to be way in the future. Those things don’t exist. The root cause may be very hard to determine but you can still have an effect upon it. That’s the thinking that you can have an effect upon the root if you can just get close to it. People are coming again on that second they’ve been told by their physician that there’s nothing wrong with you or you’ve got this or that and here’s your pills. Let’s treat the paper. They’re in a cycle of trial and error. Those people where they do? They go online. They’re going to get a million hits on any condition they put in. You type in diabetes or thyroid or digestion disorder. Whatever it is. You’re going to get a million of things to look at. Or you go in your neighborhood and you find there’s a guy down the street doing even Naturopaths and so they do a diet program, they’d do an exercise program, they do a supplement therapy. They do some other therapy with some gizmo and they’re making a ton of money kind of praying on people’s discomfort. People are stuck in the cycle and they get pretty desperate. They just want someone that can help them. They’re spending a ton of money, people are making a ton of money but it’s really not filing the needs and the way we know that is people still walking around with all other problems. If something besides what we do and we’re just catching on really work then all these other people would be out of business. That would be part of my objective is to get more people doing what really works. Anyway, so you got this way of thinking that there’s an underlying cause or condition and how close can we get to it. We can’t give them medical diagnosis and we don’t want to. I have one diagnosis and you might have heard this I call it metabolic chaos. There’s just things wrong going the body. Everyone has different weak links in metabolism. There are thousands and thousands of metabolic processes going on in the body 24hrs a day. Most of them under control of the autonomic nervous system. Your sympathetic and parasympathetic balance of course and all these other things going on. There’s this idea that if symptoms incurred somewhere downstream that’s just another problem is showing up. Upstream from that is dysfunctional and misprocesses and above that is just what I call is metabolic chaos. Things are not working the way they designed it to work. The design is perfect you don’t have to teach these cells what their job is certainly. You don’t have to teach any tissue what kind of tissue it is. It knows if it’s a brain tissue or adrenal tissue or muscle tissue whatever. All the cells, tissues, organs and systems, the what their job is it’s just being interfered in some way and not supported in some way. Everyone’s so different that the opportunity for voids in that system for weak links is just really abundant. There are just millions of things that could be going on. Some of them all at once. We have one diagnosis. It’s metabolic chaos. There’s stuff going on. Our way of looking at it. This is just the discoveries that I’ve made. Ashley, I’m answering your question now. I ran five labs in every person. And it’s because all the people I try to help, we start with a lady who had low bone density and then what helps with bone density, the hormones, we start testing hormones. What I found out just by working with people, sheer numbers. The people who had low bone density when we worked at their hormones, not only could we help them with their boned density but they felt better. They got more energy, their brain fog went away, their sex drive came back, their weight normalized, their immune system improved but still it wasn’t quite whether something else – I learned to check for hormones in every person using saliva testing and we checked the immune system. You can use saliva testing for that. Which I found out that when I ran another test, we call the metabolic assessment profile which is a urine test. We checked digestion to make sure they’re actually breaking down and absorbing food properly and that leads into dysbiosis and things going on in the gut that just aren’t right. Also detoxification. Is the liver clearing the blood that we’re supposed to? Three pints of blood a minute go through the liver. Three pints a minute? That’s a lot of blood flowing through your liver and most of that blood is supplied off of the digestive tract. There is some blood coming in the rest of the body to the liver through an artery but the rest of it comes it sort of drained off the digestive system. You got all these things going on. Again, you can make observations. You can collect saliva, you can collect urine, you can collect stool and you can collect blood of course. And start making observations. This happened over a long period of time. I ran a ton of labs and I narrowed it down to what would give me the most healing opportunities for the money. People are going to invest, they have to pay me my professional fees and they have to pay for the lab work. It sounds like where am I going to get a lot of people who do that? they’re everywhere because people are sick. They’re sick and tired of being on it, the cycle of trial and error that they’re in and will spend out of their pocket. Last year you said you’re spending over $20,000 a year on what’s so called health care like insurance and it doesn’t even cover the kind of health care that you want. It really covers like emergencies that’s not a bad thing. Maybe you should buy insurance that only covers emergencies for $5,000 a year. That’d be reasonable. The rest of the money you spend it where you want. On care of the human frame or on diet and the causes and prevention of disease. You could spend it a little better and execute everything cover that you want for your 20 grand. That more than some people make by the way. Some families of three or four people. At least in this country. You got this mindset. It’s a methodology, it’s a step by step process. I ran those five labs in everyone. Hormone, immune, digestion, detoxification, healing opportunities, energy production, and nervous autonomic balance. Sympathetic and parasympathetic have to be balanced for your body to function, right? We look for these opportunities. Now some person we might find 10 things to work on, another person five someone else, 15. It just depends on the person. Everyone is different. Everyone has this vital voids or weak links in metabolism. Again, we’re not diagnosing or treating some specific disease look here’s what’s wrong with your body. If you fix those things, then downstream what you see in your doctor for hyperthyroidism, irritable bowel or chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia or brain fog, cloudy thinking all these things. That stuff should go away if we fix everything upstream. As a matter of fact you can remember it like this the word hidden. I call them the hidden stressors and dysfunctions. Hormone, immune, digestion, detoxification, energy production, and nervous system balance. H-I-D-D-E-N. Easy to remember right? Yes. H-I-D-D-E-N, the hidden stressors, and dysfunctions. You ran some small handful of labs, they’re not that expensive you can get them done and you have a professional. I’ve trained almost 3,000 people. I’ve trained those for you because everyone’s an individual and it matters whose test results are these. That’s another down side to allopathic medicine is everyone’s the same. All of their studies are on what’s called a cohort. No one person that it applies to it. On a group of 50,000 people approved lifespan by 20% with this drug. Of course, 18 of those people died from the drug and another 19 are permanently braindead or something damaged. You get the point? So we don’t work with cohorts. We work with individuals. That’s the other part of the methodology. It’s a method step by step it’s a way of thinking about the human body in each person individually. We look for this healing opportunities in the HIDDEN stressors and dysfunctions that I just determine overrunning of thousands of labs on thousands of people will get you the best results. Will get you back to sleeping well. Get up feet on the floor running. You got lost of energy to get through. If you eat your breakfast, you know you’re going to have energy to get through to lunch get a lot of stuff done. Same thing between lunch and dinner and then you’re still going to have energy and clear thinking to enjoy your kids and all the stuff that we all want to do. It’s all high-quality life. Also preventative. My theory in anti-aging using that system, you should feel 40 until you’re 80. Anti-aging isn’t, you don’t wait until you’re 65. Look I’m 66 years old, think honest 20 years ago when I was pretty much abusing my body without knowing. I call it a well-used body. I’ve done some bad things to it but I was trying to fit in this methodology and also approach as an anti-aging tool. It will get you over the things that you’re dealing with that you don’t like about the way you look or feel. Without going to physician getting medical diagnosis and treating that specific thing with drugs or worse surgery. So once you do this assessment and it will include a very careful history taking of your complaints or the main ones you want to go away. How often those things bother you, how long has it been going on, what things you tried first, what’s your motivation running your life, you have to be motivated client for us to take you on. We would run those labs and then we would individualize the protocol, design a d-r-e-s-s program. Be very happy to go into the more details on the labs if you want. Like what hormones we’ll look at or what markers or we could go towards the DRESS program. How does that work? What are the specific questions? \xa0 [01:04:41] Ashley James:\xa0This is good. Let’s start with because I know my listeners are probably on the edges of the seat going, “Yes, tell us more of these labs.” We have a Facebook group. The Learn True Health Facebook group and so many times people are asking about labs by we have to have the right philosophy and mindset when looking at labs. We can’t be reductionist which is like allopathic medicine just looking at one thing like I’m going to look at the liver and that’s very reductionist just to look at one organ only. We need to look at the whole system because every organ affects the other. Every hormone affects, everything affects everything right? We need to look at everything as a whole. When you’re looking at thyroid and you’re looking at cortisol and liver and digestion and energy and sleep and all these. What I’d love to know if you could give some examples of labs or what are the absolute must labs that you always run with people. Of course it’s individualized because one person comes to you and their health history is all about digestion the other comes to you and it’s all about headaches and maybe nervous system stuff. doesn’t seem related but you dive in deeper and absolutely could be related because again, everything affect everything in the body. Please explain more about these labs that people learn to run in the functional diagnostic nutrition course and learn to run on themselves and their clients. \xa0\xa0 [01:06:16] Reed Davis:\xa0Again, back to the early days of doing the bone density testing. One I was finding is that I should look at hormones at every person. I was doing it just specific to the bones but I realized after a while testing enough people, that “Wow. This is critical for all kinds of reason not just how it affects the body.” Just what you just said, it affects everything. We run a saliva test. We take a morning, noon, afternoon, nighttime saliva sample. We look at cortisol and DHEA. Cortisol is your stress hormone. You could look at the pattern of cortisol and DHEA which is a counter regularity to your stress hormone. You have stress hormones which are catabolic and it breaks your body down. You’re under stress and then you have the anabolic beginning with DHEA, that’s the parent of your sex hormones, so that’s your anabolic. You need catabolic and anabolic balance. The bodybuilding up and the body breaking down. There’s a normal amount of each. Does that makes sense? Let’s look at catabolism. We find people that are overly catabolic. They’re cortisol dominant. Their bodies are breaking down. It’s not like you’re going to treat the paper like “Oh, here’s something for the other side. We’re not just going to prescribe or recommend. There’s supplements that can do that. You can treat the paper even in naturopathic medicine. We start obviously what? Looking for the stressors. Why are you in this catabolic state? Is it just mental-emotional? When I say they were stressed? What do people think? They hate their boss, their kids, god I don’t know. They have mental-emotional stress but there’s also physical trauma and things like pain. Walking around in pain is very stressful. The body responds the same to either thing if your neck hurts its response is catabolism. Cortisol dominance. If you are in a \xa0fight with your spouse all the time it responds the same way. Also the same thing with internal hidden stressors that dysfunctions in your bodies that occur over time or parasites, bacteria, funguses, viruses or food sensitivities, and things. Environment influences, new draperies can cause hell in the household because the outgassing of chemicals and fire and other things. What we do is we look at that to assess the cortisol DHEA ratio as a marker for catabolic anabolic balance. We need to get this in balance or nothing else matters. Why treat one little thing downstream when we can go upstream to a major factor like that. Oh, by the way instead on a pathway of investigating the stressors and some of that again, requires the investigation, the intake, careful history taking and things. A person might have a hobby that’s actually hurting them. They’re spray painting little figurines in their garage sucking up paint spray, that’s not a good thing. Anyway, you get the point, there’s investigation involved including the lab work. We can look for food sensitivities, parasites, bacteria, fungus, viruses and things that they don’t even know is there and physicians are looking for the most part. We look at a major thing like hormone balance. The catabolic anabolic hormones and also while you’re doing that. As long as you’re collecting saliva, one I look at the sex hormones because estrogen need to be in balance with progesterone in women testosterone needs to be balanced and we can even look at melatonin. That’s not a sex hormone but that’s hormone that’s important we can get that from the night time sample. We can do a morning, noon, and nighttime evening – morning noon, afternoon and night time saliva sample. Get a lot of information and frankly again, standard physicians don’t recommend tests they’re not looking for that. They’re looking for disease. They’re looking for a way, cholesterol or whatever it is that they’re looking for deepening on your complaint. That’s some pretty important test. Saliva test to cover those things. Again this was just one of the first tests I started running because I was looking for a specific thing like bone density but I found out the ramifications of it by running thousands of it and giving those same people things to do. To look at the stressors, let’s run some more labs and narrow it down to these five labs. That’s one. It’s a hypothalamic pituitary adrenal stress indicator type test. We’ll also run by the way saliva’s easy to collect at home and send in at your convenience and it’s not really expensive so it’s a good investment as is this urine testing that we do. Again easy collecting at home. We look at that digestive marker. Are you breaking down protein? By what you collect in the urine. You can see how well a person’s breaking down protein. If you’re not breaking down protein, I see amino acids. Amino acids turn into neurotransmitters. Think of all the ramifications of having neurotransmitters are out of balance. Your moodiness, your irritability and all the other things that are going on in your body that require good neurotransmitters. The other things that amino acids are good for like they’re the building blocks of all the enzyme and tissues in your body. Things like that. It’s remarkable how important breaking down protein is. That same marker, if you’re not breaking down protein, how well do you think you’re breaking down your carbohydrates and your fats? There’s other ways to look at that but it’s a great test and on the same lab, the same urine sample, again we’re trying to get the most bang form the book. We can look at oxidative stress. What’s another indicator of excessive stress at some form toxins or something in your environment. You could be over-exercising, you could be smoking, you could be exposed to other toxins or you could get internal toxic producing organisms or processes. So we look at oxidative stress. Basically if you cut open an apple, it turns brown, right? That’s oxidative stress. Oxygen, free radicals, and excess of that is a bad sign. It’s great marker as an overall assessment of health. Something again physicians just aren’t looking at because it’s an insidious long term contributor to chronic degenerative disease. \xa0 [01:12:59] Ashley James:\xa0\xa0I did not know that you could do urine testing to see your oxidative stress. That’s amazing. Just thinking about oxidative stress, one of the Naturopaths that mentored me he described, he’s a pathologist before he became a Naturopath, he says that cholesterol, the bad cholesterol is oxidized cholesterol, it’s oxidized fat. It’s not, it doesn’t cause disease in and of itself. It’s like saying, look over there there’s smoke. It’s the effect of oxidation. If you take someone who eats fries everyday like fried and deep-fried, that contributes hugely to oxidative stress to the body. Eating anything with oil and fried food. So that person would then have that. Have high levels of oxidative stress but also people are low in selenium for example because selenium recycles the body’s own glutathione which is our antioxidant and so I can see where your starting to put the puzzle pieces together because you’re looking at their diet and their lifestyle. If you see that their melatonin is low and that saliva test and that you see that their protein is low in that urine test you’re like, there you go because their melatonin’s low because they’re not getting the amino acids to the body needs to make the melatonin so you’re starting be that detective. Am I on to something there? Is that how it works? \xa0 [01:14:29] Reed Davis:\xa0Yes. I’m impressed with your knowledge of oxidative stress. It’s another form of stress that creates an imbalance between the free radicals and the body’s ability to counteract them. That’s why we take anti-oxidants and we include anti-oxidants in our diet. We need the vitamin C, D, and E and these things from food hopefully but if not, you can take some if you take excessive oxidative stress you want to increase the anti-oxidants but you also want to go, that started the immediate care idea. Again, we don’t want to just treat the paper or use the paper to sell supplements or supplement program. That’s another unfortunate occurrence but we want to find out why again it could be over-exercise, smoking or something else hidden. We would just use it with the detective mentality. Like here it is, here’s the problem, your oxidative versus anti-oxidative balance is off. You have an imbalance, let’s correct it. That’s a pillar as you mentioned that can be corrected with our lifestyle program. \xa0The diet and supplements especially the right kind of exercise, getting the right amount of sleep all these things are critical. So far, we’ve looked at saliva testing, all the hormone, anabolic and catabolic balance, the balance between the sex hormone, getting a peek at melatonin which is I could fill in the blanks in there more, that’s a great anti-oxidant by the way. Most of us made in the gut, people aren’t aware of that. They think it’s just from the penile glands at night time, not true. You do this saliva test, you do this urine test, we said we can look at how well you can breaking down protein which is reflective of how you’re breaking down other things. It’s also reflective of the dysbiotic condition we find in people’s guts. Not enough good flora vs the bad flora. That’s where a lot of your protein that comes from. It’s the bacterial breakdown. We’re looking at that for a saliva, form a urine test on the same urine test, let’s look at the oxidative stress. From the same urine test, we’re going to look at liver function. It’s not the enzymes and things that physicians look at to see if you have a disease it’s just that it congest it. If you’re spilling this it violates and sulfates over into the urine, they collected by kidneys and excreted and we can measure them. If you have a congested liver like before the recording started, we talked a little bit about this scenario that you might want to work on. We see people are overweight there’s so much fatty liver around, it’s unbelievable. Liver it does a lot of things. A couple hundred different operations but if you just look at it as a vacuum cleaner bag collecting toxins and unwanted particles off the digestive track and wherever you’ve got to change your vacuum cleaner bag don’t you? If you ever changed a bag in a vacuum cleaner the old ones that used to have bags you know that it runs a good vacuum cleaner when you changed that bag when it gets too stuff it’s not working, you put a bag in it, you get a brand new vacuum cleaner. The liver can be assessed that way. That what’s included in this urine test. We’ve only run two tests, we haven’t spent much money but we’ve discovered a lot of healing opportunities. The catabolic anabolic imbalances, the sex hormone imbalances, the low melatonin could be real problem point to figure out, gut dysfunction and things, we’ve looked at dysbiosis and protein and other food breakdown. We’ve looked at the oxidative stress, we’ve looked at liver congestion. That’s a lot of bang for the book and we haven’t given any medical diagnosis. I’m not playing doctor. We’re just being detectives trying to help people or ourselves figure out what’s really wrong. Where can I clean myself up in these upstream functions so that downstream I have to just feel better? I have more energy and I lose the weight. I have a better ability to build muscle, sex life, whatever it is to you that is not right about. The thing about the look or feel that you want to change. That’s only two tests. Another really important one I’d run just about everybody, depending on how they come to us and people come with all these metabolic chaos, they’ve got multiple complaints hardly anyone says it’s just my hangnail, if I had a little more energy I’d be better. They’ve got multiple complaints. Some of them walk around these things for years and years and years, they’ve seen 10 people already and everyone kind of picks and chooses. Try my therapy, try my little machine or my whatever they’re doing. Individual therapies and modalities. When that doesn’t work, you’ve got to start looking upstream and that’s what my entire system is abided on. I would look at gut function a little deeper. I like running an intestinal permeability test just to make sure that your villi and microvilli are in good shape. That you don’t have excessive permeability at the gut, things like that because it’s a healing opportunity. You can call it it’s all kinds of problems for a person. Just unbelievable amount of problems. Include eventually autoimmune conditions and serious stuff. That, by the way, is another urine test do it at home. Doesn’t cost a lot and you can get these markers and start doing the things that takes to repair the damage. There’s two of more tests as a matter of fact if you just ran those three you’ve got a hell of an assessment. “Wow, look at all the stuff that I can fix. Finally, someone has figured out what’s really wrong with me. How do I fix it?” Well, there’s a couple more tests critical in that process. Now we’re ready for the DRESS program but the easy way to shortcut like diet, for instance, is to run a food sensitivity test. We can get into the DRESS program now but the story hidden stressor is the parasites, bacteria, fungus. Those are all easily detectable on stool testing. There’s different ones, there’s microscopy, there’s microscope. There’s culturing you can put the stool in Petri dishes and see what kind of pus grows on it for bacteria or even yeast. You can also run DNA testing. There’s ways to look at the stool that are very informative. More healing opportunities like if you have bugs. You’ve got to get rid of them. You can go to doctor for that or people mostly are choosing to self-treat using age-old botanical treatments. More that are less toxic less harmful to the good bacteria and things. How do you like them apples so far?\xa0 \xa0 [01:21:51] Ashley James:\xa0I like it. I like that its sounds really non-invasive. Saliva and urine test and stool test. All things you can do at home and mail in. There are mold and parasites, a huge problem that people aren’t aware of. Most people aren’t aware that they could live in several different states and they can actually take mold with them in their belongings and many houses in different states even out in the desert where you think, “It’s like humid here.” Absolutely, you can have mold in the dessert living in Las Vegas for example or living in the mountains. Mold is huge and it is a big problem for our health. I’ve had several experts on the show talk about it and it can cause so many different symptoms but obviously immune problems like if someone goes, “Man, I just catch every single flu and every single cold that comes around. I just feel like I’m always sick.” Something’s going on that your immune system is so taxed right now. What is going on? Parasites we think just because we have clean water and we wash our hands, we don’t live among filth like we did thousand years ago. That there is someone immune to parasites right because we live indoors where there is no mosquitoes biting us every day so we don’t think that insects, you know parasites are kind of like parasites if you think about it. Could bug us and you go outside and you can’t and you start to become aware that we are just animals. We are animals that are a little bit more sophisticated but we are not impervious to parasites and all animals can get parasitic infections like we can get a bacterial infection. I’d love for you to just explain a little bit more about mold and parasites because even if someone had some health issues that are like persistent, it’ll be great to rule out. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if they discover that the root cause was mold? Or the root cause was a chronic parasitic infection? Wouldn’t that be wonderful because it’s so easy to manage versus everything’s’ out of whack, where do I start? Of course do the DRESS. Do the diet, rest, exercise, stress reduction and supplements to fill in the gaps. Obviously a 100 % of the population would benefit from that formula but wouldn’t it be wonderful if someone suffering and it’s an easy fix, right? To dress mold and parasite rather than years of dialing stuff in and still suffering. If you could tell us a bit more about the parasite and mold testing that would be wonderful.\xa0 \xa0 [01:24:50] Reed Davis:\xa0Okay, sure. In context with what I was saying the investigation, looking at these critical markers for balance in your body. Moving on to than what more specifically is part of the stress takes you this metabolic chaos going on in my body and the things that you can do like some of the testing to determine. Stool testing for parasites, bacteria, and fungus is common. I mean we test everyone for that, now you find things but there’s the issue I have with it people think, “Oh, I found your problem.” there’s people who caught on to that there’s parasites for instance or bacteria like H. pylori and these different things and fungi and things. They’re thinking that they found the problem. Take you back on the whole vitalistic theory. You were already sick for the most part before your symptoms occur. Your immune system would have to be pretty compromised before some of these very common bugs, by the way, if you look at some of the literature, they’re not even considered a problem, they’re considered commercial or sort of normal to have some bacteria and parasite. You can make a mistake easily by saying, “Oh, your problem sounds like parasites.” See some digestive issues and things like that, pain in the gut or whatever. Diarrhea and things, it sounds like a parasite then you check and you pat yourself on the back “Yes, I found your problem, it’s parasite. We’ll get rid of it and you’ll be fine.” No, you have to heal the whole person. You have to heal their entire digestive tract and bring their immune system back to balance and order. It’s not as simplistic as, “Oh I found this parasite now I’m all better.” You might feel better initially but you’re going to get the next bug that come along if you don’t really repair the whole person. Mold is a little different because – by the way you can run a test it’s called H-E-R-M-I. The hermi test for mold in your house. That’s the sort of best test for finding out if you got the kind of mold that will make you sick and there’s no good molds for us has been exposed to especially when it turns into something you can inhale. If it turns that can be inhaled that’s a bad deal for anybody. We recommend certain people with certain conditions. If you want to learn a lot about mold, I would go to\xa0survivingmold.com. Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker is probably the world’s leading expert in that area of research. He’s really specialized in water-damaged buildings and the molds and the long term chronic effects and how to remediate the building mostly you just want to get out, get ways from it. Then what happens to the body, unfortunately, what happens to the body can be really kind of diluted and the testing can be more expensive and hard to get for what it does to your immune system and inflammatory processes in your body. It really wakes up some complementary pathways and it can be really hard to detoxify molds. It’s very insistent. It loves to just re-circulate. It’s a very hard to bind to get out of the body. Because they’re mold toxins, it’s not the mold itself they’re just toxins from the mold. There is what’s called the micro toxin test, you can measure for that. but it’s not our first-line test. I don’t just run a micro toxin test to people. We have to clean them up first. The FDN program looking at the hormone, immune, digestive, detox so on is a grounding program to get yourself cleaned up where you should be better. You should be a whole lot better. I’m talking about just three months of doing our DRESS program. Doing our customized for your test results and your history. If you do that customized DRESS program, the diet, the rest, the exercise, the stress reduction, the supplementation. 90 days you should really turn the corner or made it a few steps up the ladder so to speak. Yes, I feel a lot better. Then we start getting into more insidious things that could be in your environment. We don’t chase the mentality we still just being good health detectives. I’m not a person automatically would just pick a test like a mold test. I have some good screenings for it. There’s a nasal swab you could do for more things that’s pretty cheap. But I wouldn’t just run as a first-line. I just hate this idea, Ashley, it’s never worked for me anyway to put it that way. To try to guess what the problem is based on symptoms, remember we’re trying to get ways from that. Because people, walk-in from regular doctor, regular Naturopath you know I’ve got this traditionally reliable cluster of symptoms that sound like thyroid. Or traditionally reliable that sounds like chronic fatigue you known whatever it might be, “Oh, let’s run a test for that.” unfortunately, they find something that they say I’d the answer to your problem. It’s hyperthyroidism and the doctor would write a prescription, Naturopath would sell supplements, helping to get the test results in range. You might even get the symptoms to a bit but something there is going to come back or new set of symptoms occurs because you haven’t really sorted out the chaos upstream. When the chaos or new set of symptoms appear if you just say, “Now, it sounds like low testosterone, run that test and yes, so now you have a person, yes, it’s your low testosterone. Now you’re on your thyroid medicine and your testosterone, what’s next?” It’s a new cycle of trial and error. Unfortunately, a lot of people do with mold, they focus on that one things. They don’t really address the entire person. Including all the stressors. The mental-emotional, the physical trauma, bodies that are all banged up. That hidden I would call that a major contributor to metabolic chaos. Mold really sucks. That’s my medical diagnosis. \xa0 [01:31:57] Ashley James:\xa0Very technical. \xa0 [01:32:00] Reed Davis:\xa0Yes. We’re speaking big terms here. \xa0 [01:32:02] Ashley James:\xa0I heard that parasite testing could be a bit more complicated because parasites can hide in the body. How do you account for that? \xa0 [01:32:12] Reed Davis:\xa0Well, they do. It’s not just parasite, it’s bacteria they like to hang out together. If you go back to what I said about it, even if you find a bug if you think you’re just going to take something and kill that bug and return to normal it’s unlikely. There are called biofilms which is where they hang out together there’s what’s called comsensing. The bugs know that the other bugs are there and they start hanging out together. They start not interbreeding but that becomes fertile ground for them to replicate to grow and even to mutate like fungus mutates. You can get so called would be called normal spores and things but once it take hold it can become very invasive. Punch holes in your intestines for instance. It can get really bad. What we do generally again, this depends on the initial intake like it’s really important to take the history. We have our own intake forms of things we use. Make sure that our clients are filling out a good number of forms. It sounds like a lot of work but probably isn’t going to take more than 15 minutes per from each form, each form that we have. People threw out three or four forms. It’s a good investment in helping us to number one, take stock of where you are today. As a practitioner that’s very important. we don’t want them changing their mind about what their problem was 3 months down the road. Like, “Hey, we’ve been working on your migraines and now you said you’re complaining about your toenail are swollen.”\xa0 You’ve got to get a good history and make people stop and think where they’re at. You can grade those things too. We do that, that will have us then running labs and get people on the DRESS program and their problem start to fade away. We actually have a point system for those intake forms. Some might have 300 points or 90 days or 180 days, 6 months down the road. They’re down to like not very many points but everyone has some points in there what. So you got that which is both objective and subjective. You got the lab work which is all objective. Periodly objective, it’s what’s really going on inside your body. Then you have progress being made. Let’s make a point here that no one sat at the top of the hill. I don’t know anyone with perfect health. I know everyone’s on a stairway towards it but I don’t know too many people that – I’ve arrived here I am on the top of the mountain but we’re all – some of us have more stairs to climb than others. We look up to the people who are sort of able to help us and guide us and we look down and we help those what more steps up we help people up. Like I personally, 66 years old. I’ve a very banged up body from sports, motorcycles and just surfing. Just things that I wrecked. Muscular skeletal mostly. Also during my 20s and 30s was exposed in a lot of chemicals in different profession. Different job I was in. I don’t know what exactly what did that to my liver. I’m always watching. I’m always working. Again, I have less stairs to climb than most of my clients and my students come along and same thing. We’re all just on a continuum of improving. I don’t know anyone at the top so just with that mentality, let’s look at what are the healing opportunities and what are the things that I can do and just I can answer more questions about the testing but I want to talk a little bit more about the DRESS program. \xa0 [01:36:12]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Yes. We’ll definitely get into that. Absolutely. Before we do, I have one last question about labs and that lab companies. I’ve heard stories about how it can vary results can vary from lab to lab. Do you have one company you work with? Or do you have handful companies like Doctors Data for example? Or Great Plains labs? Do you have handful that you’re like, I really find that these labs are the best in terms of results or do you have one specific lab that is just the best? I’d love for you to shed a bit of light on that. \xa0 [01:36:49] Reed Davis:\xa0The answer is it depends on what you’re testing for. There’s no lab that’s a specialist in every kind of testing or for everything. They are companies all they do is genetic testing. That’s all they do. You can even just run the 23 in me and then do what’s that cheap and then you can run it through various software. There’s one called Prometheus that I like but there’s other. The hard thing about my job is that no stuff coming out all the time. It’s hard to be on top of every new discovery and research and things that are going on and half of them could be junk because there’s no end to the amount of money being spent in this industry. So I do my best to vet out things and there’s a company called Bio Health Laboratories. I’ve been using them for20 years because I think they do the best saliva testing for that HPA access stress profile. I think they’re the best. I mean the quality and the quality assurance. I’ve been working with them for 20 years and I’m actually clinical advisor on their clinical advisor team. Great Plains you mentioned them, they’re a great lab. I use them for the micro toxin testing. They also have a finger stick test for food sensitivities. It’s not the best food sensitivity test but there’s nothing else around it can be shipped anywhere in the world. You prick finger and you put drops of blood on the blotter and you send it in the company. It doesn’t have to be frozen or anything like that. It’s stable for a week in the mail would be okay. You get a rough idea of the foods you’re sensitive to, it helps fine-tune your diet. You mentioned Doctor’s Data. They’re a good lab. By the way, this bio laboratories does an excellent stool test for pathology. Is there other stuff you could run the stool test for? Yes. Bio health doesn’t run those other parts of the test. There’s DSL which is a good test. They do DNA testing on stool. So to answer your questions, it’s various labs depending on what you’re looking for. \xa0 [01:39:04] Ashley James:\xa0You’d want DNA lab testing on stool because you’re DNA testing not for human DNA? Your DNA testing for parasites? is that correct? \xa0 [01:39:11] Reed Davis:\xa0The bugs, yes. \xa0 [01:39:12] Ashley James:\xa0Okay. \xa0 [01:39:13] Reed Davis:\xa0Yes but the mere presence of their DNA this is why I like some other testing isn’t telling you really have virulent it is. When you run a stool test and you culture, they take the stool and they shake it up real good and they mix it with a couple of things and it becomes a puree and then they are able to put it in these Petri dishes. They could grow eight different dishes with different mediums or EGAR in each dish, put it in an incubator for a few days and see what grows. Depending on the medium, you get growing different pusses. If there’s little bit of pus or a lot of pus that could make it a difference in your individual assessment of that person and what they need to do next. Also microscopy. There’s sometimes just looking through these high-powered microscope just having a really good lab rat. That’s his or her job and she just sits there and looks for bugs or bug parts and that will fit. Sometimes a human being involved it’s very important. There’s various types of stool testing and DNA is branded about as the ultimate best because it’s looking for non-human material and by the way you can look for that same test looks for other markers that could be reflecting how well you’re digesting things, how much pancreatic enzymes you have. There’s a lot to skin the cat. Once you’re trained in the basics and you can start to look in the finer details and individualized the labs you choose for each individual person. Again, it’s never about the test results, really it’s whose test results are these. That’s part of the methodology and mentality. Yes, I’ve compared a lot of labs like oxford biomedical for food sensitivity testing, they run what’s called the mediator release test. Unfortunately, it’s not covered by insurance and most of this isn’t because even though that test has been used for 25 years. It’s still called experimental by insurance companies. Why? Why because they don’t want to pay for it. Remember I told you about the miracle case Susan about depression and she’s got the hives for 2 years and she has been on this anti-inflammatory that made her gain 40pounds. That’s the test I ran and found her problem. Now I ran it on every person. Do I always hit home runs out of the park by running that test? No, because people are going to have food sensitivities and it’s the major factor in their problems like migraines. I’ve seen migraines gone but no other people the food sensitivities aren’t that big of contributor to the metabolic chaos. They’re minor contributor to the metabolic chaos that is producing the symptoms downstream. For one little boy I’ve got to tell you, this is way back in the day. A lady was in for chiropractic and we’re talking your own health says, “I just wonder if you could help my boy, Billy. He’s 9 or 10 he’s always in trouble at school. They want to put them on drugs for ADD.” They have teachers diagnosing in the classroom. They want to put him on drugs for ADD because instead of paying attention to the teacher, he’s paying attention to the gardeners working outside or something. It’s telling something with this little boy. Anyway, we just did that test on that boy, got him off certain foods. Some of them are obvious. The highly colored and sugared cereals and all that stuff. Guess what, in two weeks, the principal of the school tracked me down and said, “What did you put Billy on?” “Listen, I didn’t put him on anything.” I ran a test got him off crap and now he’s a better-behaved kid. Things like that to you and I Ashely, that’s just common sense but it’s not always common practiced. That’s why I love labs. They just get into the degree that finding is contributing to metabolic chaos is to a degree to choose full in reversing the metabolic chaos and creating order especially in that hormone, immune, digest, and detoxification and so on and those areas. \xa0 [01:43:50] Ashley James:\xa0\xa0I love it. I’d love to know you mentioned earlier sometimes we’ll never find the root cause but we’ll be able to help the person. For example, my son who was having asthma, he’s so healthy and he eats so healthy and I’m thinking, “What’s going on?” We changed pediatricians. We went form, of course, naturopathic pediatricians. We changed pediatricians and the one we went to, the new one goes her first after being hospitalized twice for asthma. She goes, “Why don’t we do food testing?” That’s her first response like, “We should be testing him for allergies.” I’m like, “Wow. Thank you.” I brought it up with the first pediatrician and she was like, “Well, you know that’s down the road.” I’m like, “What is going on?” she started telling me that it’s normal for kids to be sick and to have asthma and it’s just like weird. It’s what some doctors will say and sure enough he’s allergic to 7 foods, garlic, fish, almost every single kind of fish like it will set him off. Eggs, avocado, things that we would eat every day. Like he would eat avocado, ate it every day, garlics and everything. A handful of other foods. Things that we also would avoid like Wheat, dairy and oats. He was allergic to and if he had any exposure to these food, he’d have asthma and dust mites. Dust mites are easy to manage but these like garlic is really hard. All of his food is made at home, cooked from scratch or I totally have to be diligent with looking at the ingredients but I’m wondering so now he doesn’t have any asthma by the way but if has any exposure, he starts to get a little wheezy and then we go, “Okay. Now we got to be diligent.” But that’s if there’s an early warning system. His body lets us know, he starts coughing he does a little bit of wheezing. We really make sure we vacuum twice a day. That kind of thing. Make sure that his food is 100% clean in case he accidentally ate something contaminated with eggs or with garlic. I’d love to know, what causes people to have these food allergies? Like you said, we may not ever get to that level of root cause but in your testing, do you see something that says like do you see that “Oh, here’s leaky gut, and that’s what causes.” Do you see that there is evidence for something even deeper than food sensitivities that causes them? \xa0\xa0 [01:46:25] Reed Davis:\xa0Yes. Again, there are inborn errors in metabolism. Their weak links in metabolism much of them are acquired but some are inborn and there’s this, you just have to use the word milieu of factors. That why I use the phrase metabolic chaos and the root cause exactly may not be known or discoverable. It’s too far upstream. There’s not a test. The test sometimes is getting off of food and seeing if you feel better. That’s a really good one. \xa0 [01:47:04] Ashley James:\xa0Yes, because there’s no side effects. \xa0 [01:47:07] Reed Davis:\xa0Yes and there’s no diagnosis in the food sensitivity. I coached football for 15 years. Youth football. And I can remember this is again, early on which made me so proud and know that I was hitting in the right direction. I didn’t have it all figured out. Same test, I have a kid, the mom always come up the boy “He can’t practice today on Wednesday.” I said, “Well, he’s not going to play Saturday then. You know if he doesn’t practice he won’t know the play. He had to sit out Saturday.” and she’s like, “Oh but he’s got asthma.” I said, “Well, what are you doing about that?” “Oh, he has an inhaler and he takes his inhaler.” “But we don’t allow those on the football field.” and I just “Did you ran him tested for food sensitivities or anything like that? This kid within a very short period of time never had asthma again. I still see that kid around time sometimes. Now he’s a big strapping grown man with no asthma. It was so miraculous she had her other kids tested. Like, “I want to test my whole family.” “Oh, yes. Maybe That’s a good idea.” There’s this ways to be it’s a mentality that I think we’ve covered pretty well here. Always looking for the hidden contributor to metabolic chaos and to the degree that the root causes are discoverable we can work on it. If it’s not discoverable if it’s just too hidden, we can still have an effect upon it, by getting what are the healing opportunities? What healing opportunities can we identify and my systems based on just years and years and years of observations. If you checked the hormones, immune system, digestion, detoxification pathways, energy production, which is I tell you about in a minute when we go to diet. Then of course again, this idea of autonomic balance. These six things that hidden stressors and dysfunctions are answering almost every case that comes in. Again, there are additional work to be done. Sometimes but they’re a little less common. So most people, all the common things that people complain about today that generally considered chronic degenerative diseases or conditions that’s our wheelhouse. \xa0 [01:49:39]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0I love that. And it’s such a big wheelhouse. Oh my gosh, pretty much the whole population can come see you and get results. \xa0 [01:49:49] Reed Davis:\xa0A guy’s called me up and he wanted to know if he should take the course. He’s a practitioner and he goes “I don’t know if I’ll find enough people to work on? Will it be enough people to work on? “ I said, “Where do you live?” He goes, “New Jersey.” I said. “No, there’s not enough sick people in New Jersey.” What a joke. There’s just you never going to ran out of customers. They’re going to pass by the way we have FDN practitioners spent the least amount in marketing because we get results and we all have referral-based practices. Too much long to talk at least about the D in the DRESS program and anything else you want. But diet is really one of the biggest questions. How many diets are there out there? A Hundred? A thousand? I don’t know. There’s no one of them that is right for every person. I guarantee you that there’s no one diet that’s right for everybody. What in the hell do you do? By the way, this was something I spent a long time trying to overcome this question because I knew people had to go, you’re made of food how do I get people to eat right? I started off. It just happened to be the diet of the day in 1999 when I started this was Atkins diet. Everybody was on Atkins diet. Well, it’s making other people sick. Why is that? I want to know. This person does the Atkins and oh man, losing weight, feeling more energy and doing great. Another person’s like, “I got sick. I had no energy. I didn’t lose a single pound matter of fact, my skin flared up and I felt worse.” Why is that? Well, it’s because we’re all unique individuals with different, I’ll use this phrase here metabolic types. A metabolic type is simply, meeting your genetic requirements. We’re all from somewhere and if we all could go back, 500 generations which is a long time ago, you probably find your correct metabolic type and diet that goes along with it. If you’re Mediterranean, it makes sense. If you’re people today having the paleo diet which they think means eating more meat. Well, if you’re from the Anglo-Saxon, heritage eastern Europe and this kind of places where 500 generations ago, there was lots of hunting and gathering on and your people lived on deer and rabbits and muskox, mammoth or whatever. That’s just all about all they ate along with some local flora. Seasonal plant material and you ate just that and that was your heritage wasn’t mixed with any other heritage you probably would do pretty good from that. What if you’re from the island of Borneo. That diet would be horrible for you. There isn’t just one diet that is right for everyone but there is a way to discover it. There’s some principles involved in that way to eat that are really, really critical that I earned. I think it’s really important since I have the opportunity to share. There are things you need to know. You have macronutrients, protein, fats and carbohydrates. They’re the fuel that your cells burn for energy so that cell can do his job. The cells don’t have to be taught anything. They know what to do, they have innate intelligence, the same intelligence by the way that keeps the earth in alignment with the sun and the sun in alignment with the rest of the universe and everything like that. There is an innate intelligence that hangs everything together everything happening all at one time and you yourselves know that stuff. They know if their brain cells, muscle cell, adrenal gland cell of whatever. If you can fuel them properly which requires the right mixture of the macronutrients, the protein, fat, and carbohydrates. You’ve heard of protein types and you’ve heard of Carb types and there are such things that people want to know, they’re called mix types. It had to do with the oxidative rate. The rate at which rate in quality and quantity of energy being produced on a cellular level. Energy is produced on a cellular level and it’s mostly dictated by the fat, carb and protein ratios. You can dial it in almost perfectly. There’d be some variations based on the time of the month. For women, seasonal variations for some people. Otherwise you can really dial in the correct fuel mixture for you because if it was just simple as either way your ancestors did 500 years ago, that was not available and guess what, people 12,000 years ago started roaming the world and we’re all just really interbred. These very few pure of this that or anything except of native tribes and they’ve been studied. A really big thing is protein, carb and fat ratios. Do you kind of fill me on that?\xa0 \xa0 [01:55:23] Ashley James:\xa0Yes, absolutely. I’ve looked at that in terms of how to get better results for people and you would change the ratios if someone was an athlete and wanted to get a different performance versus a woman who wants to lose weight that’s less active for example. You can adjust and play with those ratios, the gram of carbohydrates, fats, and protein to make the fuel mixture that your body wants. If you’re a sports car or a little minivan. Your metabolic needs are you were saying and your genitive pre-disposition but also the quality of a carbohydrates matter. Quality of protein, whether the protein is from something highly processed like whey or meat versus a protein broccoli. Just different quality of proteins and all of the nutrients that come with that food. We need to take into account as well. We need to know the highest quality of the fuel right? And the ratios are really important. But I love that you’re talking about getting those ratios in a healthy mixture for the body and not being extremist with this 80% or 90% fat diet sort of 100% meat diets where the ratios are way out of balance. Maybe in a short term someone could get good results. Anyone can lose 10 pounds changing their diets. It kind of shock the body, shock the metabolism but it’s what you see in the long-term, and I like that you’re looking at subjective and objective by looking in at how the person is feeling in their own skin. And the labs. Because over time you’re going to track a diet and see if you’re getting the results you want or not. \xa0 [01:57:22] Reed Davis:\xa0Well, that’s really well put. Let’s take little bit step further with this energy produced in a cellular level based on the carb, fat, protein ratios. We’re going to assume automatically that you’re eating really good high-quality food. That your beef or whatever your meat is organic. That your fruits and vegetables are organic as you can get. Not that they have so much extra nutrition in those fruits and vegetables but at least you’re not getting the herbicide, pesticide, and rodenticides all the different. You want to keep poisons to a minimum. This is what people start to write down in terms of “how do I know if that’s the right fuel mixture for me?” Number one, you’re going to be satiated. You’re going to feel satisfied. Your meal will feel like the right kind of the meal. You can start with breakfast, you can start with lunch, any day of the week you want. Just try to measure about an hour and a half or even two hours later, if you had a reasonably sized meal. What is your satiation? It is the principle of satiety. If you’re not fully satisfied, if something’s missing, if you’re craving something then we would want to adjust ratios a little bit. No, I’m not feeling satisfied, it’s missing something. That’s not satiation. Satiation becomes a really important factor. Again, every breakfast and hour and a half, 90 minutes later, check three things. One the satiety, satiation versus cravings and hunger or something. Assuming you had a real meal in that. The next thing is energy. You need really good high-quality strong energy from your food. If it’s fuel for the cells and they’re producing energy to do their job you should feel energized and energetic. You should have enough energy to do the work or play that you plan to do until the next meal comes along. Which in case, by the way, should you feel a little bit hungry before the next meal, your blood sugar could be checked and things like that. Satiation is one, should feel satisfied. An hour and a half, two hours later you should still feel good energy. I’m not talking about the kind that you get from coffee where you feel kind of nervous to even do something but you feel tired underneath. Not that kind of energy really strong solid good energy, the third thing, these are worth writing down if you’re going to try to adjust your carb protein and fat ratios. The next one is sense of well-being. Believe it or not. You should feel good. If you feel really grumpy for not reasons that a sign that your meal may need some tweaking in terms of protein. If you’re grumpy and someone just cut you off at traffic or got fight at work, that’s kind of okay but if everything’s going wrong why do I feel grumpy or irritated or one of these negative emotions. Lack of sense of well-being in anyway, those three things are really critical and that requires you a bit of self-aware and pay attention and maybe make some notes so the next day you can adjust the ratio. There’s a lot more to diet but that’s some really critical factors. Again, assuming your food is high quality you’re not eating crap out of bags or boxes all the time. You want to eat real food. There’s stuff that’s on the outside the grocery store. I mean on the edges. Stay out of the aisles. \xa0 [02:00:04] Ashley James:\xa0Right. Stay out of the aisles. Go shop around the perimeter of the grocery store absolutely. I love it. Very cool. There’s so much to this but you make it simple and it’s a delight learning from you and I’d love to have you back on the show. Because we just really scratched the surface, I’d love to have you back to dive in. I know my listeners are going to love today’s interview. I know they’ll love to have you back. I want to make sure that people know more about your course. I’m going to take your course. I’m really interested and I know my listeners are right there with me. For those who want to check out the course, they can go to\xa0learntruehealth.com/FDN\xa0like as in functional diagnostic nutrition. So\xa0learntruehealth.com/FDN. Of course, that link is going to be on the show notes of today’s podcast at\xa0learntruehealth.com. Tell us a bit about your course. I believe when they go to that link they’ll get a discount to your program. That’s what it says and I’d love for people to know a bit about the program. It’s self-paced. It’s my understanding. Because we’re all busy. It’s online it’s self-paced. Can you tell us a little bit about it? \xa0 [02:02:18] Reed Davis:\xa0Oh sure. It’s quite a robust course as I mentioned earlier in the program. I’ve interviewed every person that ever took it. It started as a 2-day workshop and that was 11 years ago July so long time ago. I’ve just expanded and expanded what more can I do? What can I do to make it better? And every person gets asked and I’ve had a lot of honest people who told me “What if you did this? What if you did that?” I take all of their advice and I reiterated the course. Now it’s a full-blown course and first of all obviously the labs, all the investigative processes. The hormone, immune, digestion, detoxification. I teached them the anatomy physiology and biochemistry. For those who already know some of those stuff. It’s a great review. For those who doesn’t know anything I speak in very plain language and teach you what you need to know. There’s no fluff or frills or fill in this course. It’s all practical stuff. I’ve been told by people with masters programs and program said this is the most practical thing I’ve ever done ever. Because it’s just nitty-gritty stuff, all the physiology and stuff for around the lab work. You truly understand what you are testing, what are the hormones and other markers and how to interpret them based on an individual where we focused is on the case studies and how this is an individual test results. It’s not to treat the paper. That’d be easy to teach. I can teach you that in 10 minutes. This is again, a robust course to take so it’s about 6 months or more to get through. I’ve had people do it in less but they must’ve had nothing else to do. It’s all that. Then, of course, it’s going to be case studies and interpretation. Working with individuals and yourself. You’re going to run those labs on yourself. I pay for two of them and as part of the course, I’m paying your way some of that internal investigation on you. You could take it just for your own health if you want to. That alone would be worth the price of admission. I’ll teach you all that and then I teach you all the protocols. The D-R-E-S-S program. We just ran into diet a fraction of what you might want to know. It’s how to get the right diet for each individual and the rest program and I teach a lot about sleep that’s really important and about the exercise. You just said some people are like drag racers others were like Volkswagens. The same there is no one exercise program that works perfect for everybody. You’ve got to know some things. You might not be a personal trainer actually put them through these things. You actually teach your client or yourself the right way to figure it out. The diet, the rest, the exercise, the stress reductions is one of the biggest modules because there’s so much varieties and the types of stressors were affected by. Some of then I go back to my early days of the environmental work I used to do and what’s in the environment, other parts where food sensitivities other part that showed the things around your house. As a matter of fact, for people who just want to taste of how to deal with that area in their life, go to environmentalworkinggroup.com. It might be .org, environmentalworkinggroup. We get a lot of stuff about the environmental toxins and pollutants for them. So it’s diet, rest, exercise, stress, reduction. How to asses an individual in various stressors and there of course supplements. I don’t own my own line which I think is to my credit because I know I’m leaving a lot of money on the table not having my own line but I just have avoided that but in all about supplements I teach you what you need to know to support the body, to stimulate the immune system, to substitute what’s missing from food. For god’s sake. These antioxidants and essential fatty acids that we talked about the vitamins and minerals. That’s really important stuff. It’s now all the lab work and assessment and how to work with individuals and yourself. It all the DRESS protocol. What fixes everything? How do you fix every cell tissue system in the body at once? That’s the DRESS modules and then, of course, there’s the business modules like how to do this for a living. How to work with people? How to intake? How to make sure you’re working with a client is going to be successful? Guess what? Don’t let them hire you. I teach you actually how to select people who are going to be successful and make a good living doing this, doing the good in the world that all of us want to do. \xa0 [02:07:03] Ashley James:\xa0I love it. It sounds amazing. I took the IIN course. I really appreciate it because its focus is on the emotional mental health of doing health coaching. Of course, you learn the dietary theories of a hundred different diets but you don’t learn labs you don’t learn supplements you don’t learn nutrition. I’ve been mentored by Naturopaths for the last 8 years. so I’ve learned a great big deal about nutrition and supplements but what I loved about IIN’s course is a lot of it is the emotional mental work. I see that someone who’s graduated from IIN as a health coach would love to take your program because like you said there’s no fluff it’s a hundred percent everything you want to learn to then go out and work with clients. People who have never worked with clients could take your course and do a great job and people who do currently work with clients like IIN graduates. It would complement their continued education so well. I think it’s a wonderful complement. I’m very excited to take your program. Thinking about the cost of your program and thinking about the cost of seeing a functional medicine practitioner, for example, it’s about the same. To see someone for six months or a year to work on a problem I could pay someone else. I could find local practitioner maybe graduate for your course and I could pay them and do the testing and pay them to look at it and asses me and help me figure out what I want to do. Or I could pay to take your course to learn it myself to do the work on me and be about the same amount of money but I would have that skill set for the rest of myself to continue helping myself for the rest of my life. You know some people are just at a point where maybe they don’t have mental clarity. I remember when I was very sick with chronic adrenal fatigue. I did not have the capacity to take a course. I was just at that point, where I just wanted someone to help me and maybe people they just want to find a practitioner that’s taking your course and go and work with them. For those who want to sort of be taught how to fish instead of just be given a fish, they have that skill set for the rest of their life then taking your courses is absolutely amazing because in the long run it’s going to save them so much money years to come they can apply these lessons then their selves and their family and loved ones. Then have that background potentially doing that as a career and adding that to their repertoire. Wonderful. I love it. Is it audio? Video? Tell us a little bit about the format of experiencing your course? \xa0 [02:09:55] Reed Davis:\xa0Well, it’s online for the most part but here are quite a number of head to heads, one on ones with mentors. Some of my best students that’s how I’m grown by the way from the original two-day workshop at 19 people, we now have close to 3,000 that we’ve trained. The course reiterated over and over again. The latest in relation is quite remarkable if I do say so myself. So you’re going to watch the lessons, you can download them to your computer though so you don’t have to be online. You could watch them on a bus or on a plane as long as you’re on your computer. There’s turnouts I have a I think a 180 different forms I give you including the legal documents and onboarding things. Ways to complete the assessment, develop the DRESS program and apply it to a person. The coaching method. You mentioned IIN which is a good school and just every other health coaching program or institute whatever it might be out there. There’s tons of now. I remember there was two or three so we’re one of the earliest been around the longest but there’s some good ones out there but I would consider them to be if they were a bachelor’s program, we would be the master’s program. We are the next level but I break it down in such a way and again I said there’s such a thorough for those who did know a few things it will be a great review for others who hadn’t been exposed you’d be good for everybody. The only prerequisites are that you want to help yourself and others. You’re willing to walk the talk. If you want to help people and you want to walk the talk set an example, it’s an amazing opportunity to learn. If you only work for yourself and your family, it’ll be worth the price of admission. The fact that you could turn around and recoup your investment in a very, very short period of time if you follow my business model, it’s pretty remarkable and last but not the least, it’s a community now. It took on a life of its own years ago. Even the first-class there’s some alumni that still are they’re still doing things. The alumni group which I formed, officially we have an official alumni group we started two and half years ago. There’s hundreds of members. These are people who do this seriously for a living. Like we have convention every year now where we hang out and share. It’s really remarkable. I’ve been told by some of my mastermind people don’t start a tribe and not lead it. I’m here for the rest of my life to lead the charge. In my way just like Ashley is in her way, we all know what the goal is. It’s for health and wellness and happiness of the planet. If you go back to that quote from Thomas Edison, doctors aren’t getting there. They’re not evolving. As a matter of fact, many are getting more interested than just diagnose treat model. We have to present something to go side by side with that. The people really want that really get somewhere they want to go. \xa0 [02:13:10]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0I love it. I’m so excited. My listeners love reaching out to me and telling me how it goes for them especially when they become a health coach. Several have become health coaches as a result of listening to my show and hearing my journey through IIN. I’ve had three people email me saying that they were going to become MDs and they quit med school and they became Naturopaths instead. Because of my shows, they found their true calling. Which is so cool that people are finding their true calling through listening. I’m really looking forward to hearing in the coming weeks and months from my listeners who take your program. Go to\xa0learntruehealth.com/FDN\xa0and take your program and then have an amazing experience and then they’ll reach out to me and say, “This is how it affect my life. Thank you.” I love that they let me know how it went for them. I’m really looking forward to hearing the stories because your program is results-based and it’s all about results. It’s why you do all the labs. So that you could move the needle. So you can get results. It’s not just so you can prescribe a drug. Right? \xa0 [02:14:25] Reed Davis:\xa0Exactly. Yes, and the community is amazing it is what made us what we would call today group sourced. If your feedback from people is, “Well, that was great. What if you do this, what if you do that.” You actually have people listening including me. Where else can we take this? There’s new technology come on board all the time too. There’re new labs, new parts, new things that we can play with like the big thing today is wearables. The wrist bands and the rings and different things. There’s always something new that fits right in that I can’t be the eyes and the all-seeing. It takes a group to do something like this. To make it a true movement. I hope we get some great feedback even great ideas. That’s even better. \xa0 [02:15:16] Ashley James:\xa0I love it. Wonderful. My listeners have always been so impressed by them that they are a people that take action. They’re action-oriented people so I’m looking forward to you hearing the wonderful feedback as am I. definitely listeners go to learntruehealth.com/FDN to look into it. See more information and see if it’s right for you. I’m really excited to take your course as well and you know, wouldn’t it be wonderful if a hundred percent of the population knew this information? Could you imagine a world where everyone knew the labs that they could take to better themselves? If everyone knew like, “Wow. I have this symptom maybe I need to look at this direction” How self-sufficient would we be? It’s a big threat to the companies that don’t want us to be self-sufficient. \xa0 [02:16:17] Reed Davis:\xa0Yes, I think it’s called empowerment but it comes with self-awareness first and having a space in your own head or being to be at peace. You’ve got to know what that looks like and set goals for yourself. That’s what health coaches supported to do but it has to being with us. Again, the pre-requisites are you want to help others and you be willing to walk the talk. We are pretty self regroup, pretty high level of consciousness among most. We make money but we’re not in it for the money. It’s just so rewarding. \xa0 [02:16:58] Ashley James:\xa0Wonderful. Excellent. Thank you so much for coming into the show. Please come back. I’d love to dive deeper. There’s so many topics that you have to teach and I’d love to dive deeper. It’s been wonderful having you on the show. \xa0 [02:17:09] Reed Davis:\xa0Perfect. Thanks, Ashley.

He is a spiritual healer. And when I set out to start the podcast Learn True Health I knew that health was not just physical, that it was emotional, mental, spiritual, and energetic. So we have to address all aspects of life. Now, I thought when I first started interviewing Eric, that it might be too out there, like I might turn people off because it was, you know, we’re talking about stuff that’s not in the mainstream. We’re talking about spirituality and energy healing and stuff that some people might… I don’t know, I was afraid that it wouldn’t land well, and boy, did I have nothing to worry about. I have had a flood of listeners tell me that their favorite interviews of all 300 plus interviews has been the ones with Eric Thorton. I’ve had listeners right in our Facebook group, the Learn True Health Facebook group to tell me that Eric Thorton’s interviews change their life, completely shifted their entire world, has helped them to understand their life and the problems that they’re facing in a whole new way. So as I kept getting this wonderful feedback from you, I was encouraged to keep having Eric on the show. And I’m really glad that he’s being well received. Because what I’ve learned from him has made a big difference in my life. And today in this interview, you’re going to hear my experience of my first session working with him in which he helped me to resolve a major life issue that I had since I was nine that it was running my life. And so you get to hear about my session. \xa0 \xa0 [2:16] Ashley James:\xa0I am very thankful that I have this platform.

This is Episode 375. \xa0 We’re back here with Eric Thorton and not much time has passed for the listeners. Because I just recently published our last interview. But for me, a lot of things have happened because I had my session with you. \xa0 \xa0 [7:37] Eric Thorton:\xa0It was good. \xa0 \xa0 [7:39 ] Ashley James:\xa0And we’re going to talk a bit about that. And we’re going to talk about a few other really interesting topics. So for those who’ve never heard Eric, I definitely encourage you to go back and listen to the other episodes where we were discussing karma and spiritual health and how that all of this cultivating spiritual health cascades into developing physical health and mental health and emotional health. And so we’ve covered that over a period of several interviews. And I’ve gotten great feedback from a lot of listeners saying they love learning from you. I’ve had a few listeners say it’s been a life changing, hearing what you’ve said, really helped make their lives make sense. And so we’re just going to continue to have Eric on as we dive deeper into the spiritual topics. And hopefully everyone can find more clarity and the answers that they’re looking for. Because as we go to heal our body physically, many listeners have physical ailments, we need to look at emotional health, mental health, spiritual health, energetic health, and how every aspect of our life contributes to either physically being ill, or physically being well, and building ourselves back up. And so that’s what we do with Eric, when we come and learn more about the spiritual realm. So welcome back. \xa0 \xa0 [9:03] Eric Thorton:\xa0Thank you. The spiritual realm, well I’m happy to do this, because my purpose in life is to teach people about the soul and how it affects us energetically, mentally, physically, etc. And that’s my goal in life. So whatever people can gain from it maybe can offer a little bit of non biased, maybe a little bit of non bias because I’m not against religion, but I don’t promote it. I’m not against the New Age, but I don’t promote it. I’m stuck and I’m caught in a bridge between the two. And it’s very grounding. And we try to make it logic, we try to make it understandable instead of a mystery in the work we do. And that’s why people, it often change their life, because it’s like, “Oh, that’s what that means.” So if you’re a religious person, we can actually help you, if you love that, help you have a better walk with your religion. And if you’re not, we hope you have a better life, a better walk has non religious. So there’s no judgment here in that respect. So everything we do, everything I say to people is to help explain who they are, what they are, why they’re here, how it’s affecting their body, what that’s all for. And we look at everything that happens to the body, to the soul, everything to look as the learning experience. Because the education of the soul is the purpose of life, the soul bears repeating, the soul can’t taste a strawberry, it can’t be male or female. Yeah, those are animal things. And it comes here to experience, it comes to the human – ours type sold us to a human body to experience these things. And to gain that compassion from having to have to go through the processes that we as our animal goes through, over time it gives you a god like compassion and love for all species. It’s like you got an older soul person, they’re going to love animals, they may not own a half a lot of them, they still love them, or someone who’s younger, so they can eat them, you know, and abuse them on the way. Someone that’s in between maybe wants them taken care of better before they eat them. It’s not wrong to eat them. It’s just how we deal with it, that’s wrong. But anyway, the purpose why I’m doing this is just to help people get a different perspective, that maybe make sense for them. And then the healing sessions are to help people heal such as yourself, of things that drive us in a way that we don’t understand, because the medicine men and women are not part of our lives anymore. So like with your healing session, you know, things changed for you. And they of course let you talk about that. But this is common. Things change at this different level and it relieves stress. And just by relieving stress changes how the body deals with life. And if a person is being compelled by something, causing them a tremendous amount of stress, their body can’t cleanse itself. Their body can’t repair itself well, it changes your immune system, it changes your biochemical function. And if you can just relieve the stressor, things start to change all on their own. So as you’ll see my website it says I’m an exorcist. I am. Exorcist means energy removal. It implies all these drama from TV and movies. But there can be a little drama. But most the time it’s not, if you do it with full sight, full hearing and full knowledge. Because then there’s no argument, there’s no guessing. It’s just there you see it, you experience it, you can remove it. So anyway, that’s why I like doing this, is to help get that out. So tell me about your experience. \xa0 \xa0 [13:16] Ashley James:\xa0Well, yeah. Before I do, I want clarification for you. You said newer souls will just eat meat and might abuse animals, medium souls start to think what is humane treatment for animals and then old souls, souls that have had more experience in incarnations – they want to become vegetarian or vegan, they want animals treated properly, and they don’t want to kill them for sustenance. But then you said it’s not wrong to eat animals. Can you elaborate on that? I know we talked about this in a different context, but this idea of creating that wrongness or that guilt, right? To have people feel a sense of wrongness or guilt. Can you just explain why and I know you’re a vegetarian yourself, but can you explain why it isn’t negative to eat animals as you were pointing out? \xa0 \xa0 [14:21] Eric Thorton:\xa0Well, energetically, it’s not negative to eat the animal, if everything has a proper balance. So if we’re going out, and let’s say a hunter wants to get some meat. If he goes out, and he or she goes out and kills an animal properly, doesn’t use a bow and arrow where they run around for 10 hours or two or three days dying, they shoot them, they’d shoot them properly. The animal is biochemically in better condition for eating because it doesn’t have all that adrenaline and all that other stuff going on. But you’ve honored the animal by taking its life swiftly. And animals are a lower species and all lower species on every planet in the universe are subject to being used by the higher species in many different ways. You know, we unfortunately use elephants for example for many different purposes. I don’t know if people eat them or not. But I would expect if they were desperate enough. So we use them in many ways. And it’s fine if you’re honoring the animal. If you’re abusing the animal in any way shape or form, it changes them biochemically. But it also changes the way you digest them, the way you use them. Now meat itself, as we get older, our bodies can’t tolerate it because it acidifies the body. Not going to go into that whole thing right now. But it does as everybody knows, when your body gets acid, you can grow things that you don’t want to grow, called cancer. And if you keep your pH higher, you will not grow as many cancers. And I’m sure you’ve had people on talking about pH because that’s a very important part of physical health. And so as we age, we can’t tolerate meat well because of that factor takes a long time to digest, and it puts acid in our system. That being said, if you have an abused animal, it tastes different. It digests completely different. My family are a bunch of sensitive. So I mentioned in this episode we had with chicken that we got that was organic from Whole Foods. I bought two chickens. And we were eating meat then. And some of my kids telling me and I don’t have a problem with it. It’s just not okay for me anymore because of my age. But these chickens were organic, free range, everything you can possibly do to be the most natural it can be from a supermarket. And I just cooked it up their favorite way and served it. And literally, the kids were pushing it around the plate. And they always love to eat it before. They were just kind of pushing it around the plate. And then I took a leg and the leg was broken. So I looked at the other leg, the leg was broken. So that my kids were picking up on that abuse. And I had not blessed the animal for giving it life. Its life for our sustenance, I hadn’t taken away in the prayer is supposed to, in your intention with an animal in your intention or prayer, you thank it, by thanking it you’re removing the drama, the drama and the trauma. And so it comes in more neutrally. Most people don’t even think of doing that. And so I thought well, this is a good experiment, because I had another chicken from the same batch. So we literally threw away the chicken, we couldn’t eat it. One bite my stomach’s turned because we’re sensitive to that type of abuse. And so in the garbage it went two weeks later, I took out the other chicken that had been frozen, so it wasn’t as good. As far as you know, when you freeze me it’s not as good as when it’s fresh. And I cooked it up the exact same way. Blessed it remove the trauma and the drama. They ate it like they didn’t even think about it and both legs were still broken. So the circumstance of the death of the animal is huge in the way we process it and digest it. Whether we’re sensitive to it or not, it still is happening. It’s all energy. So if you have all that negativity, you know, you watch the Cowspiracy, why do they even do this to the animals? You know, I’m watching them lock the tail off of an animal before it goes in to get shot. It has to stand there while they lock the tail off and it screams, you’re getting in all of that from the food. And plants, don’t get me wrong plants have life. But they don’t have suffering. That’s a mammal, an animal thing. Plants – they die, yes, but they don’t have suffering. So people say, well I eat plants because well there’s no soul. No, there are souls in plants, but they don’t have the nerves and the suffering. And so when you pick a plant, the soul leaves. It’s like if I cut down a tree, I asked the soul to leave before we cut down the tree and it goes okay, and it goes into seedling or something, the energy of that life force. It doesn’t have a problem. And so when you’re eating a plant, you don’t have the drama and the trauma period. It’s not there. And while you eat the animal it can. And that is a problem for the human body. So it damaged me. So now I don’t eat it. But I’m not a vegan extremist. It’s what a body needs. And ultimately, as we age, we all need to alkaline our bodies, period. And that’s the best way to do it, is to eliminate your meat. \xa0 [20:45] Ashley James:\xa0Can you see souls like when you said you cut down a tree or you pick the plants, can you see the soul leave or if you’ve watched an animal die, or a human dies, you see souls leave? \xa0 \xa0 [20:57 ] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yes, I do. For example, when you talk to trees, you hear people talking to trees, you’re talking to their monad – the sum total of all their knowledge, of all of that species of knowledge. So when it leaves it’s quite dramatic. When that soul leaves I see it, there’s a tint change. And the tree will sit there and start to look unhealthy immediately. And like when you pick a flower, it takes so long for it to wither. Well, trees are the same thing. And it still has the evaporation happening pulling water from the earth, evaporation happening in the leaves. So you get the, I forgot what it’s called. \xa0 \xa0 [21:45] Ashley James:\xa0The photosynthesis? \xa0 \xa0 [21:49] Eric Thorton:\xa0No. Photosynthesis is the end result. But there’s a pull, the water evaporates from the leaf, it pulls the water from the ground. So that’s still going on. But there’s no life force to create photosynthesis. So it immediately gets a slightly dull look to it, to me, because I see that that life force is gone. The spark is gone. And then within a few weeks, it starts looking\xa0[Inaudible 22:12]\xa0anybody can see. Yeah, we see the souls of trees and everything else. So it’s like I have fish tanks in my office with the fish tank. And when the fish die, if I’m around, I see the soul from the fish go running around my house, I go up to the fish dead zone and one of the tanks, I have to go fish it out. \xa0 \xa0 [22:37] Ashley James:\xa0You’ve seen a soul of one of your fish swimming around your house. And that’s what prompts you to go find the floating fish in one of your tanks? \xa0 \xa0 [22:46] Eric Thorton:\xa0If I was home when it died, I would see that before it left. You know a fish soul isn’t to come back and visit like a dog, but a fish it’ll just whirl around the house for a while and off it goes. So if I’m home, I will see it, a little light that I see floating around the house. And it’s like, oh, when I go which tank is it to the guides and this one now sure enough, I go find the dead fish. But if I’m not home, because it’s not a soul that repeats that visit, I don’t know. And then I have to find the dead fish like anybody else. There it is. There it is. There it is floating. You know. \xa0 \xa0 [23:27] Ashley James:\xa0I think conceptually always believes in a soul until I held my mother’s hand when she died. And then I got to actually experience her soul move through me and fill the room. And that was like, that was just there’s no there’s no question in my mind. Because I felt it. It was very real. \xa0 \xa0 [23:53] Eric Thorton:\xa0It is very real. It’s like they proved there’s the whole song about it and the stuff that there’s actually weight to a soul. They proved it back in the 30s or 20s or something like that. But it’s amazing how science doesn’t want to repeat that experiment. \xa0 \xa0 [24:09] Ashley James:\xa0It could be someone while they die. \xa0 \xa0 [24:12] Eric Thorton:\xa0Well, it’s easy to do. But now we got better skills than they have in 1920. So they could actually get that it’s 1/200th of an ounce or something like that to change and you think they would get heavier when you die. Because the centrifugal force of the blood being pushed around your body would give a little bit lighter lift with each heartbeat. But they don’t. And it’s so much of a percent of an ounce or whatever it is to get lighter. They get wider. Yeah because it’s measurable. And nobody wants to do the experiment now. Because, well, I don’t know why. I actually don’t. I think it’d be very interesting to prove that there is something that leaves, but science doesn’t believe that. I guess that’s why they don’t do it. \xa0 \xa0 [24:57] Ashley James:\xa0Well, they can’t make a drug, so why would they be putting all that money into that kind of research? There’s not there’s not a drug they can patent. \xa0 \xa0 [25:04] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yeah, but not a lot of money in that. But science eventually, always proves out spiritual healing and spirituality. It’s like Einstein, he theorized that the earth is in a time wave. I forget the exact words right now. Well, they proved it two years ago. You know, they have such sensitive experiences now that they put this little box that picks up, I read about it, you can read about it online, in the NASA journals, but I forget what it’s all called. But there’s this box that can measure magnetic pole. And they put it up on one of the satellites and it measured magnetic pole around the earth in all these different places. And they showed that we were in a time warp. That’s what Einstein call it. And it proved that we’re in a time warp. And that’s what time does, science proves out these things. You can’t see it, but it’s still there. So science needs to go on, in my opinion. Well, there is a soul there, it keeps us alive. Well, let’s learn to work with that. But no, they go, “Nope, don’t want to go there.” And they have to go eventually. Because that’s what science is. \xa0 \xa0 [26:24] Ashley James:\xa0You reminded me of a study that I read recently that blew my mind; the power of prayer, and those who are atheists or not. I mean everyone who listens to the show all come from different backgrounds. So for some people the idea of prayer is very foreign. Our four year old the other day I talked to him about prayer. And he goes, “I don’t know how.” Well, it’s something we learn how to do. But prayer doesn’t have to be religious, it can be spiritual. But they did these experiments where they had a group of people praying for and, again not a religious, one specific religion, but just the idea of closing your eyes and sending an intention and asking for goodness to happen to someone. And they did this for people in a hospital. And they found that those who were prayed for got better faster, and had a higher survival rate than those who weren’t prayed for. And that’s like you said. \xa0 \xa0 [27:26] Eric Thorton:\xa0And it is very consistent. It’s absolutely consistent. I mean it’s 100% of the people that would be experimented with, they may not build a measure at all on every person, but something will be changing them. Biblically, if you’re using the Bible, it’s called the gift of petition. And some people have a little more of it than others. But that means when you ask, it will be considered. It’s not the gift of command, but the gift of petition, it’s called. It’s amazing what our intentions do. It slips right into one of the subjects we’re talking about today – ashes. \xa0 \xa0 [28:13] Ashley James:\xa0I definitely want to get into that. Do you want to talk about that first, then we’ll talk about my experience working with you? \xa0 \xa0 [28:19] Eric Thorton:\xa0Okay. So the intention, when the power of petition works all the way to the point of death, and after death. It’s not just when you’re alive. So you have someone who’s, let’s just talk about death for a moment. It’s kind of the first starting of that. When you die, the soul that can be weighed leaves the body, it’s a freeing that occurs. People, if they’re aware of spiritual growth, they actually celebrate when they leave the body. Because it’s like a huge relief of pressure on the soul. That being said, when you’re dying, people can hold you back. You hear all these stories about people dying in the hospital when everyone goes and gets a cup of coffee? Because their intention, “Oh, poor. Oh, no. We don’t want him to die. No, and we have to be here for them.” You’re holding on to that soul with that intention. And so everybody leaves, gets distracted by the sniff of coffee and then they escape. Well, it doesn’t end there. We have these things, we have to dispose of the body. And throughout history, if you look at all the cultures, the cultures cremate, bury, things like that. They all have developed celebrations of death at some point to let them go. Well, today we have the technology to keep them. We keep the ashes, we want to do the right thing with them, we want this, that and the other. But when you leave the body correctly, the soul doesn’t care anymore, what happens with the ashes. It’s our ego that wants to hang on to them because we love our loved ones, we we adore them, we don’t want to let their memory go. But when you hold on to the ashes, you’re actually preventing – what I have noticed it’s been my experience, is you’re preventing the astral body, which is partly ego from fading, and the etheric body moving on between the into the life between lives. So when I touch somebody’s ashes, someone brings them to me. It’s as if the person that has died is standing right in front of me. And they’re still based on their thought process, if you will, is still based on ego. So they’re still concerned about family and the specifics. And like money, health, on and on and on where if we move forward correctly and the astral body has died, or faded, and the etheric bodies in the life between lives, we call those the ancestors. And they’re here to wish you good will, love, all the experience possible so you can grow spiritually, little care about your body’s pain and suffering anymore. But the astral body still does. And so when someone I’ve noticed, and it’s happened hundreds of times, to me, is it’s not just a one time incident, when I touch the ashes or the container, it’s like there they are as if they’d never died. And they know they’re dead, but they’re still hooked on the ego, because they haven’t been able to be let go of yet. So the act of burying the ashes, scattering the ashes, you are mentally letting go of that contract with your loved ones. And that includes pets. And when you do that, it is the end of that connection to the physicalness of that person. And it enhances the connection to the soul of that person. The etheric body is a much more delightful thing to have around us. Our ancestors are grand, and have the best intention for us. But they can’t get there unless we let go. And so I’ve shared that with a lot of people. And when they have let go of them, they feel better. They feel it’s complete. And that’s why throughout the world, we have all societies who never talk to each other at all do these burial rites, some like this, some bury, some mummify, but they put it in another place and they let go of it. Because that’s a universal knowing of all people feel that. It’s like when your mom died, you felt her soul leaving. Well, if you’re holding on to it, that still can’t leave all the way. So then when you finally do it, let go and it’s like you feel clean. So I don’t agree with saving ashes for any length of time. You know, if you take a month, or two, or three or five, or whatever to do what you want to do with the ashes to fulfill the person last wishes, terrific. And then we’ve got to move on. And then it helps the whole family because they become ancestors position to everybody in the family. And that includes people we don’t even know, part of the extended family that we don’t even know that they get to help. So it helps heal. You might look at it in a small way, it helps heal the planet when we bury people or dispersed them and let go of them correctly. But I highly recommend it to everybody. \xa0 \xa0 [33:43] Ashley James:\xa0Well, the reason why we bring this up is that I have my parents’ ashes and the ashes of my second cat who lived to be 20. So we have those. Yeah, Muffins was awesome. And then we talked a little bit about that before I read your article on your website,\xa0www.ericthorton.com. And I thought it’d be really interesting to talk about this, because so many people save the ashes, their loved ones ashes as I have. And also now they do things like make jewelry out of them, there’s companies that turn ashes into diamonds, you know, like a diamond looking objects, turn them into jewelry to wear, put the ashes in some kind of glass and you can wear the ashes. And so by holding on, you’re saying there’s something going on with your physical energy that’s being affected, and your loved ones soul can’t go move on completely, because you’re holding them here. \xa0 \xa0 [34:54] Eric Thorton:\xa0Right. \xa0 \xa0 [34:55] Ashley James:\xa0So what kind of physical ailments had your clients resolve by letting go of ashes? \xa0 \xa0 [35:05] Eric Thorton:\xa0It’s stress and freedom. When someone passes properly, we are sad that they’ve passed. But there’s also if they’ve passed properly and moved over, there’s a freedom now that exists that people almost feel guilty about. We don’t have mom’s requirements anymore, or grandpa’s requirements anymore. When you hold on to that, you’re actually holding on to those requirements energetically. And so you can’t develop who you were supposed to be after they have passed. There’s that we become orphans, it’s normal. And then the rules aren’t there anymore. We get to fully develop our own. So that alone changes your life. And it relieves stress, because you don’t have their requirements. Everybody, we all have narcissism. So we set these requirements up for our children to learn how to be adults. And they feel that all the way through adulthood just like I do I hear my inner parental voice and when they die, that changes. When my father died, my father wasn’t a good man. He was a bully, not going to get into all that. But when he died it was a relief. When his father died, who was a very good man, lovely father to me, it was also a relief. different type of relief, but it still occurred. Because again, the requirements that I had to have for those people, related to those people is now gone. But you hang on to those ashes, you’re going to keep mourning those requirements. You’re going to keep thinking about it. You’re going to keep engaging those requirements. And yes, when we let go, we miss a part of them. But it also frees us physically and energetically. I have a kind of an anecdotal about this, it was an animal. I was working with another practitioner, we were doubling up on clients for a couple years. And her name was Laura Smith, I think she’s in Montana now. This lady comes in and she is completely distraught. Her animals have been dying, and her life was just miserable. And we both got into her energy, started doing the energy work. We kept hearing, it’s cold, it’s dark, and I can’t get out. And we’re like going… We both hearing this second hearing. It’s cold, it’s dark, I can’t get out, it’s cold, it’s dark, I can’t get out, and it kept repeating to us. And we’re looking at each other because we’re know we’re reading the same thing. And we’re like, what is cold and dark and can’t get out. And the lady goes, “Oh, I put my dog in the freezer, I want you to bring them back to life.” The soul was stuck in the freezer. \xa0 \xa0 [38:26] Ashley James:\xa0I’m gobsmacked right now. \xa0 \xa0 [38:29] Eric Thorton:\xa0We were totally like, you know, just totally use your word gobsmacked. It took us a minute to recover. It was like, she put… But that’s the truth. She was hanging on to that. And because she was in a very abusive situation, etc. Many extenuating circumstances so she really clung to our animals for support. And that soul was not going anywhere. And it was this. It’s cold, it’s dark, I can’t get out. You know, it had no idea what a freezer was, because it was an animal. But it was cold and dark and couldn’t get out. So we encouraged her to bury the animal that we assured her we couldn’t bring her back to life because we were trying to appeal to herself and she was having psychotic problems. We said because you had frostbite. It’s like, “Okay, so we need to bury this, and we need to let this animal go.” And when she went through that she felt better. \xa0 \xa0 [39:34] Ashley James:\xa0I can see that. \xa0 \xa0 [39:35] Eric Thorton:\xa0That was a poignant moment for me in understanding about hanging on, and about ashes hanging on to any of these things. And that’s why all these rituals have been created throughout the planet independently. Because we’ve got to let go to let the soul go. \xa0 \xa0 [39:56] Ashley James:\xa0One thing, I can’t remember whether you said it while we were recording, but you said it to me earlier about, because you’ve touched vessels that are holding ashes about many times, and you’ve never met a soul who was like, “I’m totally content and happy here. And I want to stay attached to the plane.” You’re saying, every time you touch a vessel, like an urn that’s holding someone’s ashes, the soul pops right in front of you and they’re agitated about their situation, because they’re being held here. \xa0 \xa0 [40:31] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yes. And that includes anything made out of them. I was watching on Antiques Roadshow, Queen Victoria gave special gifts of little boxes with bits of her hair in it while she was alive. Well, they’re floating around you know, it’s a prize to have something like this from Queen Victoria. It’s like, well, I could connect to her instantly, if I touch that hair, or touch the locket that it was in. And it’s because energetically, you have the most familiar object in the last life that person live. You have the molecules of that, which is burnt or pieces of the body. And so it’s a direct connection to that soul. And if you’re hanging on, which is for holding on to the ashes and things like that, that soul is stuck, it can’t move on. That’s been my experience, and it’s been consistent for all the years of my whole life doing this. And I mean I don’t know everything, but it is consistent and it is current information. There was one guy who brought me the ashes of his wife. He had a little vials of them and he did give them to people. \xa0 \xa0 [41:53] Ashley James:\xa0Oh my gosh. \xa0 \xa0 [41:54] Eric Thorton:\xa0And I’m like going, “Can you get those back?” Because he put it in my hand and it’s like, she’s right there going, “Well, you need to date people. You need to do this, you need to get you know, you’re not bouncing your bank account, right.” And he had to do this and this and this. And she’s telling me about his day to day routine of his life. And I’m like, “Well, that’s true.” He’s like, explained to me that everything she’s saying is exactly right. And he hasn’t moved on, he haven’t start dating. He had married her when she had cancer, and took care of her until she died, which is nice and honorable. And she lived for quite a while. But there was a full awareness that she was gonna probably pass before him. And she wanted him to have a get married again and have a girlfriend and things like that. And so she knew he wasn’t. So I’m sitting and he’s looking at me like, “Okay.” But he brought the ashes in several times, because he wanted to get more information and before we finally let her go. But it was always one time it was about her dad. I mean, his dad, the information he had about some medical issues that were going on with him. And of course, she was absolutely correct. But which is convenient, except you’re holding the ashes back. And I could have tapped into the ancestor and maybe found out the dad was having a medical problem, or the ancestor could have come forward during the session. And they do that and tell us there’s something going on, they’re not supposed to have this happening. And we can intervene or prolong the life because of the information they’re giving us. But it needs to come from the ancestral place, not from the place of them being stuck on the earthly planes. So the motivation is very different when we have passed over correctly. So anyway, so yeah, we gotta write that. \xa0 \xa0 [43:55] Ashley James:\xa0Well, my experience working with you, everyone I’ve told my friends that I’ve been told I start with this was life changing. But that is so cliche to say that, and I even had a friend go, “Isn’t every healing session that you ever get, like, life changing until you get the next one?” Right? And I’m like, okay, it’s so it doesn’t describe what I went through with you. In our very first interview we were talking about, it was probably in our first. It was either a first or second interview after you told your story. And for listeners who haven’t heard it, you gotta go back to the first interview, because your story is amazing. During one of our first two interviews, you talk about and teach about possessions, and you start describing them. And it’s really funny, because you know what, it was our second interview because I was sitting here, our first interview was over Skype. And I was sitting here and you were describing the possessions. And I just laughed that I said, I think I have that. And you know half jokingly, but the more I learned for you, the more I started examining my motivations and behaviors. And I started diving in deeper and questioning myself where things come from. Because I’ve been on a lifelong healing journey around my relationship with food and my body, and my self confidence and working on myself for many years, I feel like I’ve done a lot of personal growth, and I’ve still have stuff I’m working on. And what I really got in the last few months, is that I would set a goal, let’s say, a new health thing I’m doing is not eating after 6pm. You know, sort of like intermittent fasting, I have a good dinner at six, and I don’t have to eat the next day till like 10. And then I go to bed on an empty stomach. Definitely, there’s lots of benefits to it. And I was excited. So I started doing that. And at 6:01 a little voice in my head would start arguing with me and would not shut up until my head hit the pillow, and my head hit the pillow and it would still try to get me to go to the kitchen. And I’m like going to sleep at you know, 10 at night. And that little voice in my head would be trying every which way to get me to break this goal, right? And I’ve had it for as long as I could remember. And so I really thought that that’s just part of me, or in some spiritual circles they call it the devil archetype where it’s like we always test our own resolve? Right? And so there’s this inner conflict that I was dealing with thinking it’s just me, but also I started to get kind of pissed off. Why? You know, I understand the science behind it. I believe in it. I want to do this one thing, right? Like this intermittent fasting. Why would there be another part of me fighting it? What’s going on? What’s the payoff? Right? And the more and more I listened and argued with this voice that would get more and more persistent, I realized, and it took me a while but I realized it wasn’t my voice. And I’m like, okay, who am I arguing with? \xa0 \xa0 [47:17] Eric Thorton:\xa0It can be a big problem. \xa0 \xa0 [47:19] Ashley James:\xa0Right. And then I hadn’t gotten too far into, but I started to see this voice in other areas of my life. Because I’d have to distinguish this voice from and I’ve actually had experts on the show talk about sort of like, the different aspects of self talk, right? You know, some self talk can be really positive. And then there’s the self talk that is really negative. And where does that come from? And what’s that designed to do? And I had one expert on the show, talk about how this negative self talk comes from wanting us to learn, but it’s kind of like so negative, you know, so if you’re near a hot stove, it’ll it might say something like, “Oh, you’re such an idiot? Why would you burn yourself?” You know it’s like that very, very negative, almost like a bully, right? \xa0 \xa0 [48:08] Eric Thorton:\xa0It’s a form of self preservation. Right, but in a very negative way. I mean it could have said it very positively like, “Oh, good job not burning yourself near the stove.” Or whatever, right? But I would notice that the voice or voices, or just these aspects of myself talk, my inner dialogue would be negative, and I would catch myself going, okay, Is this true? Wait a second, this isn’t true. Like, I’d be with a friend and all of a sudden, that voice would say, you know, “She doesn’t really like you, do notice that she just rolled her eyes?” And it would start to corrupt my thinking. Right? So now now I’m doubting myself feeling very negative about myself. And always the inner dialogue would at every which way have me questioning myself. So there’s a lot of inner conflict because I use a lot of tools from NLP, neuro linguistic programming, and hypnotherapy and all the personal growth I’ve done, I’ve taken all the landmark classes and all the personal growth work, I’d have to very consciously catch myself, and redirect, but I would always be fighting these other belief systems that were inside me. And so I’m like, okay, so I was very conscious of the fact that I was having to catch myself and redirect and stay positive and not give in to the thoughts. Because I saw you recently was it two weeks ago? \xa0 \xa0 [49:47] Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. Very, very recently. The weekend before I saw you, I had our son, my husband’s the one holding the microphone. So I’m looking at him. So my husband stayed at home and I took our son out, we were going to the park or something. And the voice in my head said, “Let’s go to McDonald’s.” And everyone that listens knows how healthy I eat. Right? And so that little voice was just really audacious to say that, because I haven’t had McDonald’s in eight years or nine years, nine years. And then it started to say, “Well, you know, you can have the fries.” And I’m like, I know I’m not gonna eat those fries. And I started arguing with that voice and I realized this voice is not me. There’s not one part, there’s not one molecule in my body that wants McDonald’s, like ever. I am very congruent about the fact that I do not want to eat that garbage. And this little voice goes, Well, let’s have the chicken McNuggets. They’re so good.” And it starts describing them and giving me images in my mind. And I’m like, no. And so I had to physically drive around to Monroe and around because I was going to go up Highway 9 where there’s McDonalds, I’m like, I am driving around this McDonald’s, I was going to Everett to meet up with a friend and go to a park. And so I had to drive make sure I wasn’t near a McDonald’s because this voice was hell bent on us having McDonald’s and it was really cool how it happened. In the past I might have given in, and I have often given into this voice thinking it’s just a part of me or, “Oh, it must be what my body needs because this is what a craving is.” And no, a craving does not have a voice, it does not have a consciousness. A craving is just a sensation in your body. If there’s an argument in my in my head, if there’s words that come with the craving, that’s not a craving that’s actually like an entity or consciousness, but a craving is just a physical feeling. But my entire life’s always been a craving followed by a thought process trying to talk me into it. \xa0 \xa0 [49:47] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yeah. Right. The craving for McDonald’s, you’re not thinking about, you’re driving along. You go by McDonald’s, because you’ve been conditioned by commerciality, your mouth starts to water and you get a craving. You’re not thinking you have to go to McDonalds, this chicken, it’s a good one. Chicken Nuggets look special. It’s not telling you describing the objects and etc. You’re driving along thinking about nothing you drive to McDonald’s, oh, yeah, you know, Golden Arches to all beef base special sauce, etc. And then you get a craving. That’s a different thing. \xa0 \xa0 [52:35] Ashley James:\xa0Right. And for me, I’d have maybe a craving for something, and I tried to resist it. But then I’d have this voice talking me into it. Or something little would happen in my life and this voice would start talking to me and I always thought it was just part of myself talk that I had to fight. And so when you describe possessions, and I burst out, it was interview number two, and I burst out and said, I think I have those right. And I think your reply was, well, those are kind of nasty. So hopefully, you know, but what was great was right before our session, I became very clear that there’s something that\xa0[Inaudible 53:14]\xa0my efforts that I feel like I’m always fighting, like Sisyphus, I feel like I’m always pushing the rock up the hill only to have it roll down again. I get so far with my health regimen and then I felt like I couldn’t fight the inner conflict anymore. It would just keep fighting. And so you know, I would take great measures like we don’t bring any junk food into the house. And we’ve been sugar free we eat as vegetarians. \xa0 \xa0 [53:10] Eric Thorton:\xa0We put a lock on the inside so we can’t escape to go to McDonald’s? \xa0 \xa0 [53:49] Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, we live out in the middle of nowhere. So it’s not like we can go to a 7/11 down the street or anything like that. My body has even gone so far thank goodness to have developed allergies to things like dairy. So it makes it really easy to not eat junk food when I’m allergic to it and I had violent reactions. But still, I’ve taken a lot of measures and yet that voice would always be driving me crazy having to fight it. So it became clear that it wasn’t a part of me. Well, if it isn’t a part of me, what is it? I’m not schizophrenic right? And I don’t have these kind of mental health issues. I know that about myself. So what is it? What’s going on? I arrived at our session, and we sit and talk for about 90 minutes, and I explained. \xa0 \xa0 [54:35] Eric Thorton:\xa0It’s all about the dream. \xa0 \xa0 [54:36] Ashley James:\xa0Okay, I’ll get there. I explained to Eric this is what I want to work on – this voice, I really feel like I have an inner conflict. And it isn’t me and I really get that it’s not in alignment with my values, my beliefs, my goals, anything. So let’s get rid of it. And Eric’s like, okay, well, let’s have you lay down on a table and see what your guides and angel’s saying, right? And the table, by the way, is very comfortable. Because I spent like five hours on it. But what happened a few weeks before, I had a very vivid dream that Eric was trying to kill me in my dream. And I woke up telling my husband, I’m like, “I don’t know if I can trust him.” I mean, that’s such a vivid dream. And I tried to analyze it over a few days. And I realized that it wasn’t true that you weren’t going to actually try to kill me, but it kind of it stuck in my mind. It’s like there’s this little threat. And then when I was here with you, you told me about how some people, I think because you were you were happy to see that I found your house okay, and I had no problems getting here. And you said a lot of people, if they have possessions, will try to prevent them from actually coming to the house. And I imagine that happens with other healers as well. Sort of like a parasite, when you start doing a parasite cleanse, if you don’t do it correctly, the parasites become agitated, and it makes the person even sicker. And so it’s like an energetic parasite is going to feel threatened. And you’ve had people not been able to find your house, even though it’s very easy to find. The car breaks down, they get injured right before coming. And you had one man, as you described, heard a voice in his head saying… \xa0 \xa0 [56:24] Eric Thorton:\xa0Continually saying, “Eric Thorton is going to kill you, Eric Thorton is going to kill you. You can’t go there, and he’s going to kill you.” And it repeated all the way here and the weeks before. So some people get this even before they meet me. They get my name in dreams saying, “Don’t go to Eric Thorton, he’s gonna kill you.” And I just sit there and crack up. Because I’m like going, I don’t want dead bodies hanging around my house. They start to stink after a while, you know. But our job is to bring life. But their job is to bring grist. So you look at all this that’s happened to you, which you’ll finish your story in a few minutes. But it’s also helped you. So I’ll let you finish your story. \xa0 \xa0 [57:10] Ashley James:\xa0What happened when the guy who was having this repeating in your head? Is that what you described to me as he got up to your front door and shook your hand and the moment he shook your hand the voice disappeared? And he’s like, “Okay, this is real.” Like, yeah, Eric’s the real deal. But that was his possession. trying to prevent him from coming to see you. And so I wonder how many people have had that experience where they’ve wanted to go see a healer and their possession has prevented them from getting that work? \xa0 \xa0 [57:47] Eric Thorton:\xa0Well, it can prevent them. But most healers aren’t exorcist. So sometimes, not every time. But sometimes the healer can actually promote the possession being stuck there longer. Because they’re not able to see that it’s a possession. And they teach the individual how to compensate or teach their body how to compensate. So this thing can work even better in the background. Because now this person has learned to compensate. So the compensation is with the education. So all these years you’ve had this. It taught you to search. It taught you to be inquisitive. Why? Why am I feeling this way? Why is this happening to me? You had no context because the medicine men women aren’t around. But it literally got you to think beyond the box, subconsciously, at first, and then consciously, and then when you connected to someone that could help, It went “No.” But the other people, it didn’t do that, you didn’t have the realization because the practitioner wasn’t a threat to it. So I would say if 60% of the people coming to me have big enough possessions that they hear that voice. It also makes them doubt themselves and anything that can happen. Because it’s compelling them in ways subconsciously and consciously. Yours was compelling you both, some people’s is only subconscious. And it all is to teach us to grow into search. So anyone has done that and we have to find the value with it. You’re here today, because of that possession. You’re inquisitive, you’re doing the blogs, you’ve been involved in health, for how many years? I don’t even know. Because of that possession. What was it? Did it make you feel comfortable? No. Did it make you feel better? No. Did it caused medical problems? Yes. But it also stretched your brain, so that you could bring goodness to the planet, which is the motivation that it had to stop you from doing it, to provide that opposite – pull back, make her sick, make your unable to do this, that or the other, and she’ll have less effect, you’re an old soul, you’ll have less effect on the planet. So that’s its motivation. And for you, it actually backfires for it because it teaches you to search, and you’ve become who you are because of that possession. So it’s not wrong, is it uncomfortable for the body? You bet. But when we actually find someone that can remove it, it’s going to resist, because it’s been there for so long. And it’s worked well. If you hadn’t had the possession ever, you may not have been inquisitive, you may have just become very depressed with the problems that it gave you. I’ve had people in a similar situation, who it hasn’t compelled yet to make them, so they were younger. And they were just depressed and miserable. Because they couldn’t get out from under its oppression, they hadn’t turned it into something positive yet, the threat to it, I mean, the purpose of it is to turn it into positivity, which you’ve done. And now because that is gone, your reach will even be farther, it’ll just simply grow. And that’s consistent with everybody. \xa0 [1:01:35] Ashley James:\xa0I like how you’ve you’ve talked a bit deeper in the past interviews, you’ve described how these possessions, although are very negative experiences when they can help us grow because they give us a set of circumstances that can find us, that has us look for solutions like I have, right? And so if I hadn’t had any of this turmoil in my life, it wouldn’t have forged me or at least I chose to forge myself. And you say some people just stay miserable, and they don’t go look to better themselves, but some do. And so the hope is that we can use this negative thing to create growth and experience. \xa0 \xa0 [1:02:24] Eric Thorton:\xa0To find God in your own way. The very thing that resists God, whatever that is, is the thing that compels us to find it. That’s the purpose of what we call dark energy. It’s not dark, but we call it dark because our bodies don’t like it. And but that is the purpose of that energy, is to project you into searching and growing, or it’s the underlying purpose of it. The Godly purpose of it. Its purpose is to prevent you. So you resist the prevention and you sling forward. It’s like a slingshot, you pull back, pull back, pull back, pull back, you finally let go and that rock slings forward. Well, the possession would be the slingshot, giving you the resistance from launching. But then it actually propels when it is removed properly, remove fully, and the person learns what it is. So when we work with people, we tell people, this is your first time session, there’s going to be more if you want to continue this, because like yourself, this was influencing your physical brain the whole time. So we remove the extra impetus, you might call it, you still have all the constructs in the brain, the neural pathways, so we have to start working on softening those. So giving them more neural plasticity, so that you can change it. By now you’re not being compelled, I should let you finish telling your story, which you should go do that. \xa0 \xa0 [1:04:07] Ashley James:\xa0Well, so that’s one thing I did notice right away after our session is that that voice was gone. And I think it was more than one voice. But it was basically the inner conflict that wasn’t me, is no longer here. And it’s been a week since our appointment. The experience for me is like you said, the neural pathways, the habits are still there, but they’re empty. Like, I’m like a craving for food late at night, when I’m not really hungry and it’s more about just wanting to eat out of boredom like that voice would really, you know, “Let’s have this, let’s go, let’s eat that. Come on.” You know, “It doesn’t matter.” “You don’t need to be hungry to eat. It’s fun, let’s go.” Like that constant consciousness pushing me is gone. And the habit is there, but it’s empty. So I can just say, “No, I’m not going to do them. I’m not gonna do this, or I’m going to do this instead.” And then there’s no one arguing with me in my head. \xa0 \xa0 [1:05:09] Eric Thorton:\xa0You can distract it. Duffy can give you back rub, and you’re not thinking about anymore. Or you drive by McDonalds, and pretty soon you’re paying attention to this headlight ahead of you, instead of thinking about McDonald’s. You drove by spurned all the commercial stuff, you’re done with it, you’re on to the next thing, instead of that consciousness as you put it, because it is. It’s alive. And the compelling and telling you what it needs. Possessions work on the brain. And it controls your body, they control your body through your brain. They can put voices in your head, they can lift your arm, they can make you, you know, you get shocked like if you get shocked by AC, you jump. Well possession can do the same thing, it can pull your legs to throw you across the room. Some of the bigger possessions can actually physically throw someone across the room. But most the time it’s activating your nerves in all parts of your brain. So it’s like drugs, you can hallucinate having drugs. Well, they stimulates the same part of the brain that causes hallucinations. And they can make you think someone’s saying something, someone’s talking to you, someone’s moving your body. Because it’s stimulating the nerves in your brain, you can feel pushed. And it’s actually your body giving you the motion, but it’s stimulating your brain so that you feel pushed. So they work through that brain mostly, like some can physically move you but most of it stimulating your brain to move you. But it’s in every form. It is the same part of the brain that you’re processing, sight, sound, thinking processes, etc. So the possessions can make you feel like it did with you that you’re hearing somebody or something intelligent is telling you, you gotta have it, it’s going to legitimize it, it’s gonna do everything it can to keep you down, keep you suffering, so that you can’t fulfill your role as your soul role. Because it’s a threat to possessions, by you interviewing me, it’s a threat to possessions all over the world. And it didn’t want that. So it’s going to try to stop you. So it can give you dreams, the one guy we described all the way up to the front door. The only reason he came in was because a priest recommended him to come in. So, “Father’s correct. Okay, gotta go see this guy.” So he just stayed with it. And then the voice was gone. And you know, it left neural pathways in his brain for certain behaviors. And he’s been working on that over the years, and they’ve gotten less. But while it was there, it was literally telling him how to do what to act, and it gets people to kill people. You know, you hear about people going insane. Sometimes they’re not insane. Someone’s got a possession. And it’s compelling them telling them, “God said to kill this person.” Well, they’re really feeling it. They’re really getting that information for years at times. And in our brain, how do you brainwash somebody? Repeat it. So possessions have a very powerful tool to use our brains. \xa0 \xa0 [1:08:42] Ashley James:\xa0I was lying on the table. And that was actually a lot of fun. You were standing up by my head. And it was like listening to a one sided conversation, but you’re talking like you talk to someone on the phone. And you were talking to my angel, my guide. And it was it was very casual. It was intention. It was like you guys were at work kind of having a safety meeting. And you were just like, “Okay, do you want to work on this first? No, this how you want me to over here? Okay. Alright. Okay, you’re going to come in here and do that.” And it was just neat hearing this one sided conversation as you’re talking to them. And then you’d come over and you’d ask me a question. It’s like, “How do you know that?” You know, like you’d say something and it was so cool. Because I didn’t really give you a lot to run with. And you’d be like, “Okay, when you were this age, this happened.” And you describe the house? I’m like, “Yep. Yes. That happened. Yes. Okay.” And so then you were ready to remove one of three different possessions and you explain their energy and their purpose, you describe the three possessions. And at the very beginning, you did a prayer of protection over me from head to toe and you don’t ever touch me, your hands are sort of above me and you’re about to kind of come in and work around my heart chakra and then you pull your hands back because I could tell they told you something. I could see in your face you’re about to do something then you got interrupted, like someone grabbed your arm, I pulled you back and you’re like, “Okay, okay, do you feel that?” And I could tell that my guides or angels were saying, “Hold on a minute, slow down Eric, she’s got to feel this.” \xa0 \xa0 [1:10:32] Eric Thorton:\xa0They wanted you to feel it because you’re an old enough so that you could feel these things. And it offers you legitimacy, if you can feel something that you know is not coming from me. \xa0 \xa0 [1:10:43]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Right. But you never said that the entire time, it’s like five hours. You never said that. But I could tell. I could tell right away. And so what it felt like was like a sandworm from dune crawling under my chest, it was circling under my skin. And that’s what it felt like and because you’d brought your hand close to me like maybe a foot away from my chest. And then you pulled your hand back. And that’s when I started to feel it circling under my skin. And that’s what it felt like. The best way I could describe is kind of like a sand dune. And then and then you said, “Okay, do you feel that?” I’m like, “Yes.” My heart was racing at that point. And yes, I do feel that, okay, let’s get rid of this very uncomfortable feeling. And you pulled it or my angels pulled it or whatever it was. It was pulled by the angels and guides. It was pulled out of me and had it hovering over my body. But now it’s out. So it has no more threat. And you’re like, “Okay, take your hand and move your hand through it.” And it was really funny because it was like putting my hand in two liters of water that was floating above me in a bowl. I put my hand in it. And it felt like cold water. And it was a warm day, up to 70 something degrees, the windows were open, there’s no fan moving through. It was a good… \xa0 \xa0 [1:12:14] Eric Thorton:\xa0I had you feel the ambient hair too. Because so many people will do this trick. Well, they have the ambient air moving, which I like movement anyway. But when they have me do this, I said okay, feel the movement, basically feel the ambient air. So you feel what’s going on around you. Now put your hand over here then compare. \xa0 \xa0 [1:12:37] Ashley James:\xa0Right. And you didn’t tell me what to feel. You were just like, “Okay, put your hand here.” So I put my hand out away from my body, like towards the window. “Okay, now move your hand inwards, what do you feel?” And and I did it repeatedly. And every time I did it, I felt like this ball of water basically over me. And so that was the first one. So then you put it off to the side and you pull it the second one. And you say, “Okay, move your hand around and say what you feel.” And it felt like moving my fingers through really thick fur. I felt just totally different. And then the third one felt like static electricity. And then you describe their personalities. And it’s exactly what I felt with each one. I thought that was really interesting. And then there was some other stuff you pulled out. And you didn’t tell me much about it. But you’re like, “Okay, just move your arm to your side, off to your side.” And as I did, I felt four columns of hot air that\xa0 hadn’t been there before. And you said, “They actually like that it kind of tickles them.” And so I move my hands back and forth. And I felt them and then you had them go. And then I put my hand there again, it wasn’t there. But each time you didn’t tell me what to feel, you didn’t implant sort of hypnotic suggestion, and you just said feel what you feel. And there was one point that you had me put my hand somewhere to feel something. And I screamed, I think I did twice because I was so freaked out because it was so clear to me that I was feeling something. I mean, not a scream, I was more surprised, not afraid, I was more like, “Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I can’t believe it, oh my gosh.” I could really feel the things because I think you\xa0 worked on 12 different things with me. I tried to count and it was a lot, it was not just like one or two. I mean there’s a lot of different things. \xa0 \xa0 [1:14:28] Eric Thorton:\xa0When the energy system breaks down because of the the main possessions, you get one and it opens the door for others. They aren’t the main one. But they still open the door and bring in different things to control you in different ways to again render you less effective than if they hadn’t been there. For that whole projection thing because your soul knows what it has to do. So it’s gonna struggle towards it. So but yeah, there were a number of things that came out. I call them ramifications of the original possession. So then we had to remove them from your house, the cars every place you’ve been, your son, any possible residue with people you’ve worked with over the years, etc. Because it opens the door for all of these people. It can damage the energy system of anyone that comes in contact with. So that’s why we have to take care of all these little details. Even biblically, it says when you’re an exorcist, you have to do it right. Otherwise, you pull back many hundreds more. So you have to go through it to be able to see here and be a part of with the guides and the angels be the part that’s in our space. That’s why they use people, because they use healers in our space, because this is where we operate the best. They’re in another space, you might call it, so they’re in the other room. So it’s be like them, using the surgeon’s hands to do the operation while you were getting instructions from the other room while the surgeon was giving instructions, because the surgeon’s actually there with the physicalness that you and I have, that there are more effective tool. They can do it without us, but it’s not as effective. And there’s not the lessons involved. So they don’t do it. People ask, “Well, why don’t my guides just remove it?” Well, there’s no lesson involved then. They’ve removed the purpose of all this pain and suffering you’ve had, with you not having those realizations, that this is real, that it’s life changing, and that you can then feel it. It’s not letting you off the hook, you still have responsibility for getting your health better so it is more effective. And every practitioner that helps you is more effective. That’s why our work is so inclusive. When you remove that energy or you remove constructs from people at these levels, everyone else’s work works including Western medicine and Naturopathic medicines, all the practitioners; Reiki works better, acupuncture. If you remove that, no one could help you. All these years, you’ve had all these people trying to help you. And you’ve learned a lot and it’s helped you with your work. That’s the possession that provided that, the platform. But they haven’t been able to get down to the bottom line of that conscious compelling that we get inside of us. That’s not our consciousness. So I love that you use that word consciousness, because that’s what I described to people. These things are alive. These are not thought forms from people, these are alive. And they have a job to do, to provide resistance. So that it compels you forward. And some people, it breaks. \xa0 [1:18:06] Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, we talked about my cousin who had received the same possessions at the same time when we were nine. And she now has schizophrenia. She developed it much later in life. Normally schizophrenia shows up when hormones kind of kick in during teenagers. And hers showed up in her… she was almost 30. I’m just thinking of it now. And it really kicked in when she was almost 30. But she had received the same possessions at the same time. And it makes total sense now looking at her life and seeing the turmoil that she went through are the same conflict, but because we’re different, obviously different people, and I can see how someone who’s maybe not I don’t know, as stubborn as I am. You know, I’m just saying. But someone who’s not as stubborn as I am, would have given into the voices and been driven insane. \xa0 \xa0 [1:19:09] Eric Thorton:\xa0Exactly. Now, the driving insane isn’t wrong, we are all going to have a life like that, or several lives, because there is experience and learning and compassion develops for people who have those problems. So I’ve been through life like that. And so I have a tremendous compassion for people that have mental problems, because I also know what compels them. Now with your cousin, the mental problems were second, they weren’t first. So it was caused by a possession. So then your cousin, if she was so compelled, which he may not be the type that can, we could remove the possession, and then any medications and stuff that she’s taking to control it will work far more effectively, perfectly usually. And then the brain can rest. And they slowly back out of schizophrenia. If the possession I mean, if the schizophrenia comes first, you still have to remove the possession so that the medicine can work better. And then they’ll require much more therapy to get it under control. Where like your cousin, it could probably come under control fairly quickly, over several months. And were someone who had it beginning, it would take much longer, we’d have to do much more healing with them to get their brain to stabilize. We have success with both ways. \xa0 \xa0 [1:20:32] Ashley James:\xa0So a friend of ours went through a pretty nasty divorce and the wife’s side of the family… And he loves his wife, by the way. It was really messed up, what took place and he wanted to be with her but she wanted to change him to the point that he wouldn’t have been himself anymore. And there was no resolving it, it was two totally opposing forces. Her whole side of the family is Orthodox Russian Catholic. And there’s about 200 of her family members sending him hate energy, hate thought forms wanting him to suffer because they’re all angry that he was the one that initiated the divorce. He just sent the papers. She’s the one that basically did everything to say we’re done. And he’s just the one that helped complete it. So there’s 200 people every day praying for his demise. And he feels, he told me he’s been dealing with health issues that don’t make any sense. He’s had tachycardia where his heart is racing so bad. He’s basically having a heart attack. He’s been in the hospital for the last few years. And he’s even had cardiologist open his heart up to try to find what’s causing tachycardia, they say you have the healthiest heart have ever seen. We cannot explain it. Now he goes to all kinds of healers, chiropractors and acupuncture and he takes herbs and eats healthy and everything under the sun. And he still has these issues, he’ll just breakout, he’ll have these attacks where his entire body will be inflamed, and he’ll be covered head to toe in inflammation and scales and hives and I’ve told him like, “Okay, we need to eat anti inflammatory diet, and you need to rest.” And he’s tried everything and when it comes down to it, he really feels like the thought form of these people or this energy from these people are harming him. The reason why I’m telling the story is that you’ve talked about sort of possessions and thought forms and that they are different. Is this an example of a thought form where it’s many people sending a negative thought to him, or can you maybe just go into, the reason why I’m illustrating all this is that my husband wants to know, and that was one of his questions, is how can we protect ourselves from these negative energies? And I know it’s a little difficult to protect yourself from a possession but thought form is something else. So can you teach us what are ways that we can protect ourselves from either negative energies, thought forms, that kind of thing? \xa0 \xa0 [1:23:28] Eric Thorton:\xa0Well, this was a friend, okay. With him, he’s got these people giving prayers of petition for his ill health and demise. Well, what’s compelling those people? So they’re sending these thought forms. But what’s compelling these people? Those thought forms are like opening a road to these people’s possessions. If people didn’t have the possession, and they were Christian people, they would never think of doing something like that. You’re not supposed to judge if you’re Christian. You’re not supposed to, you’re supposed to be accepting. What’s complaint them not to be? So they have all these thought forms, they open up because they’re throwing it all to this guy, he starts to feel ill from the thought forms, then he’s opened up to all of their possessions. And any ones that might be in his energy field, it just opens him right up. So the best defense is positivity, the best defense is not finding those vibrations. So some people say, well, you know, the best defense to not have voodoo happen is you don’t believe in it. Well, there’s some truth to that, like energy comes together. So if you fall prey to someone’s opinion, you are now vibrating at their level. So their energy can then or energy like whatever they’re having, can come to you. So it’s like if you accept someone’s opinion or not. If you accept their opinion, their beliefs, you are now having their frequency. So anything that affects them can easily similar or the same can affect you. So people ask me all the time, how do you protect yourself by becoming a vibration that’s so foreign to these lower frequencies, you might call them, that they can’t even find you. So my frequency if I’m in a bad mood, or if I’m in a place that you may call it, you know, depression or pity or just a human emotion thing going on hormonal, or whatever, I’ll call and cancel appointments. Because I could get damaged. I’m having that frequency because of my hormones, or my life going on. And I’m not able to separate at that moment. So then if the client comes in with something similar, I am vulnerable. So then I’m doing damage to them too. So it’s completely out of integrity. So the way I stay clear is by not by being what some people would call enlightened, and conscious. So that I’m just simply not that frequency. It’s not science. You know, when we sit here, there’s thoughts out there that you have to surround yourself with purple light or white light, and have this defense system against all this stuff. Well, fine, you know, that works, until someone throws your curveball. And it makes it right by your defense system. Or guess what you thinking about, you know, the possession in you got you thinking about McDonald’s, instead of holding up that white light. Well, the white light goes away, because the intention goes away, because you’re now thinking about McDonald’s, and you’re thinking that waiting can pop right in at that moment. Where if you are in your soul’s personality, and realize life is human life, and it’s okay, and all of its foibles, and everything else, and yes problems are going to come to you, but you don’t. You learn to move through them quickly. You’re not entertaining those frequencies. So you’re not vulnerable. Remember, the purpose of a possession is to get you basically to find God. If you found that, truly, there’s no more reason for the possession. It’s done. It can’t be in your energy field. And so that’s what we use – frequency. The word frequency for that, we call the things that bother us a lower frequency, and the things that help us is a higher frequency. That’s an opinion. They all have similar, not similar, they all have different frequencies, equally different. And there’s not lower or higher ones, there’s just the ones that are drawn to this type of energy, a magnet that is for this versus a magnet that’s for this. So how do you stay clear? Realizing that human life is really good in all of its problems. And realizing that after you’ve gotten there, truly gotten to that enlightened place where you accept the problems of your life, and you don’t dwell on them, you move through them, then you start becoming what we call conscious. You’re conscious, no one really explains what that is, you got to get consciousness, Deepak got to have consciousness. What is that? Consciousness is awareness of who you are on a soul level. You are aware of the soul’s personality. And when you’re in that personality, when you’re operating from those frequencies, versus when you’re operating from your animal personality. Those are based on fear, because we’re we’re all going to die. The soul’s personalities based on beautiful, everything’s fine, it’s all good. And when you are in that, when I’m working, I’m in that, and then I am able to pick up on all those frequencies really well. When I’m having my human drama, you know, people go, “Well, how do you turn it off?” I go, “Well, I’m not in that frequency anymore.” I’m having my human drama with my wife, or my kids or the lawn or whatever it is. And so then I am in my human, this. And when the second I’m clicking into helping people or meditating or the guides are calling on me for something, I’m aware that I can’t reach that from the human body, I have to reach that from the soul. And so here, I get the same problems in the human body, I get the same problems you do. I can get a possession. I’m very aware of it, though. Really quickly. Sometimes it’s a little too quick. The guys go calm down. I go, okay. One time I come into the house, and we went to dinner or something as a family. I come to the house and I was going, “What the heck did say that?” I said something else. And everyone goes, “What?” And I go, “Something’s up.” And I just started to expand to look at my space. And the guides go, “No, bam! And they throw me back into my body.” And they go, “Just let it be.” And I go, “We’re invaded. I gotta work on people. This can’t happen.” They go, “Let it be will take care of it.” And I’m going, “Okay, I guess.” So I’m looking for this change. And it was down in our washroom. And what we call a negative vortex was sitting in my washroom. And it was causing this negative feeling in the house and drawing in all these ghosts and poltergeists into my home. So I came in, and it was like, “What the heck is going on?” I’m seeing all this stuff, and smelling the classic things, cologne, cigarettes, cigars, all this stuff, the second I got in here, and then I’m looking around, and the house is full of all these energies. And you know, something’s broke here. Found it, they said, leave it alone. Because what happened was, there was a process they were showing me that took took a two week period that they had to mitigate. Remember, these possessions are beings, they have a job to do, but they’re alive, and they affect all kinds of things. And without spending two hours explaining all that, it had affected because of a client coming in, in a few weeks, certain things had to happen here to make it, so we could get rid of this major possession that this guy had. He was one of the people that caused problems in my house when we removed the possession. But if we hadn’t gone through the process, my house probably would have burned down. \xa0 [1:32:27] Ashley James:\xa0What happened when you removed the possession from him? \xa0 \xa0 [1:32:30] Eric Thorton:\xa0This was the one where I told the story last time. When the possession came out, the guides were getting rid of it. And it was a very powerful possession. And it was one when the person experienced… I’m trying to remember their experience, but the whole house got frost on the walls. And I told you a little bit about it. That came out and when the frost disappeared, because the whole house temperature dropped like 50 degrees instantly. And then it came upstairs on the way out is stamped on the ceiling of the rec room and caused the screws actually to back out. And my son was watching TV in the rec room at the time. And I just hear him go, because he was downstairs working obviously with clients. And I just hear him go, “Dad.” And we left those screws are still out. We left them there, only to remind them that this is real stuff. But it was one of those possessions that it had to be dealt with over a period of a couple weeks to get it to make it so when that person came in, they could do it because they knew it was going to be a struggle. And they had to make it easy for me. So they did and then they taught my son a lesson too. \xa0 \xa0 [1:33:52] Ashley James:\xa0You told me about how one woman who came to see you, the possession had to do with her mother and as it left blew out circuits in your house and did like $1200 in damages? \xa0 \xa0 [1:34:06] Eric Thorton:\xa0It blew out, it came out she could feel it released like you’ve kind of felt it released. And it the guides were bringing out and it was pissed. It was middle of winter, so my heater was running. So its frequency made electronics burn out. So when it came out, it just ran by my heater, and the heater was running. And Forster, he could hear it running. And also there was a pop and the heater goes… Looks like I just went damn. The person goes, “Was that my mom?” I said, “Well, no. But it was with your mom.” And she goes, “Thank God. I’ll pay for that.” And I go, “Thank God.” Because it was 1200 bucks for a new circuit board for my heater. So I had to run around and plug in heaters, electric heaters, and then order the parts for that and have it put in. But yeah, they are different frequencies and can cause different problems. Prior to that, which I didn’t get into, this possession was at her house too. And they had problems with their cars,\xa0 it’s too hot at their sink. You know, you turn the water and you got boiling water? They kept burning out every week, they have someone come and put a new one in, burn out. Put another one, all under warranty. They were doing this work for free and it was a possession. And they think they went through five Insta Hots before we got rid of the possession completely. So its frequency was just one that blew electronics. I run into all kinds of interesting processes with possessions. With yours, you were able to able to feel it and etc. and all the things that guides wanted you to do, which is perfect. And it shows your gifts. Most people cannot feel that energy. And your guides want to do it that’s why they stopped me. And they go, “No, this is part of her process. She needs to feel this.” \xa0 \xa0 [1:36:11] Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 [1:36:12] Eric Thorton:\xa0In her body and outside of her body. You know, I can’t ask people that aren’t gifted to do that. That’s why wait for guidance from the guides, because they know if the person can feel it or not. And I don’t want to make them feel bad if they can’t. \xa0 \xa0 [1:36:26] Ashley James:\xa0Right. \xa0 \xa0 [1:36:26] Eric Thorton:\xa0Because then they also doubt themselves more too. So I wait for guidance. \xa0 [1:36:33] Ashley James:\xa0At the end of Duffy’s session, we talked about that in the last interview, you gave him a whole list of, I guess his guides gave you to give to him a whole list of foods to stop eating currently, one of them being broccoli. Because his gut dysbiosis needed to be corrected. And you were given clear instructions for Duffy; do this, don’t do that, we got to heal your gut, it was very physical. And then at the end of my session with you, like you say something like your guides told me don’t tell her what to eat. Yeah, my guides would say that don’t tell her what to eat, she knows what to eat, you don’t need to tell her what to eat \xa0 \xa0 [1:37:15] Eric Thorton:\xa0Your system removing those, because they’ve specifically worked with that. Your system needs to resettle and recalculate. The guides are big on letting the body find its new setting. Once you remove some influence, the body’s got to find that and everything with your health or anybody else’s that has it at these levels that are affecting your health. Every single one of them, they say back off, let the body settle, because what affects your health before that possession is removed, and after are very different things. So you’re allergic reactions, your cravings, all those things that are happening, including all these other physical ailments that are happening in there, they’re irrelevant, because they were caused by a possession. So the body goes through all this stuff, settles out, four to six weeks, then we start to look at, okay, then we can look at your Flora prior that the Flora is not going to be right, because the possession is going to control that. And you can put all the right stuff in there, eat all the right things, to get that Flora back or not eat some things to get it back. It won’t work. So we have to respect the body’s process. Now, that frustrates people, because we all want it now. You know, I was telling you earlier I have this client who was in their second visit. And she’s a little disappointed. She emails me and she goes, “Well, I feel different. Basically, my life’s different. But I this and this and this and this and this, and this practitioner said this and this and this.” Tearing apart the work we have already done. So my response to her was, let it work, stop listening to other practitioners that you’ve listened to before our sessions, because they didn’t realize this was a problem. And I said just let it be for a while longer, then we’ll take another look. And that’s what another session would be about. \xa0 \xa0 [1:39:27] Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 [1:39:27] Eric Thorton:\xa0So we have to allow the body, the brain, everything to settle out. \xa0 \xa0 [1:39:34] Ashley James:\xa0And you and I had been talking about that story. Because so many people will come to you in their second session and go, “Well, this is better. And this is better. But what about this, and I want this and I want this.” And I think that’s what we often do in life, is look for the next carrot instead of spending some time in the now with gratitude and acknowledging what has healed, what has changed, like spend some time and let the body catch up, let the neurology catch up. And honor your body by going well, this worked, this is different, this is good. Like after having a cold, you don’t start running marathons and pulling all nighters like you need to give your body, even though you don’t have the symptoms anymore of a cold, you need to give your body two to three weeks to come back and to gain its strength back. And so we can be happy that we have discovered a new level of health. And we need to stand in that gratitude. And then work on our sort of list of complaints, right? But what I’m getting from you is that when we come from the list of complaints that’s kind of coming from that drama, that ends up attracting more thought forms and more negative energy. When we’re in drama, we become susceptible to negative energy, into possessions. \xa0 \xa0 [1:40:56] Eric Thorton:\xa0Exactly. That’s what I’m talking about of enlightenment. If this lady was in enlightenment, she would be appreciating what had been done, and letting her body revel in that and get all those positive hormones correcting a whole lot of these ailments she’s already wanting fix right now. And it’s like no, backup. It took her 50 years to get where she was at. Yes, she’s seen a lot of practitioners that couldn’t help her prior to it that maybe could now because her possessions were gone. But she spent a lot of money, I get all that. But this is a new day. With each person I work with, they’ve never worked with someone like this. And you’ve got to give it that time. And as you put it, the carrot, throw it away. Learn to be in the moment. Yes, like your health issues, they have the possibility of switching now. You realizing all this was there, and you give yourself the body time and honor this amazing thing we have, these bodies to survive this stuff are phenomenal. These bodies have these chemical reactions, these RDA, the DNA, the RNA. All these things, processes going on that’s phenomenal, that is energetic, that gets disrupted by these other influences. You got the body, give it a few weeks, been 50 years or 30 years or whatever doing the other thing. Give it a few weeks. It’s amazing what will happen. But humans aren’t innately dissatisfied. And when you’re not enlightened, you don’t learn to roll and love the positive. The things to be in gratitude for, the grace that is giving you every day of your life. We bypass it. And I understand it, because I’m the same way. I want my peanut butter and jam sandwich when I would, and not when someone was to give it to me. And so I get it. I try to explain this to people, to give it the time. But of course, people hear what they want to hear, their filters. It’s amazing how I tell people, very similar things, different conversations, of course, but there’s a certain process like discussing this with the client. And they don’t even hear it. Because they’re so involved with their negative dialogue. So that’s one of the things that over time, we change, we provide the platform, real platform for them to really start taking a look at that, and finding that place of enlightenment. So it’s kind of a challenge to me, when people come in with that agenda. I look at it as, I kind of smile when they write to me, I don’t take it as negative, I take it as, “Well, they’re in their learning process.” And it’s like, “Okay, so we got lots to teach them. I wonder if they’ll stick with it? We’ll see.” But it’s also used to bother me. Because it’s like, well, does it reflect on me and my work? You see, that was ego. And the guides go, “Think about that, Eric.” and I go, “Oh, yeah, right.” And the New Age calls it onion skins. Well, it’s not really onion skins, but it’s just how fast our body can do this. And our bodies can’t change overnight, it will kill us. And so they have to honor that. Yeah, they can provide miracles, you know, cancer can disappear. Well, that’s not going to kill you when the cancer disappears. But if they release all the toxins in your body, so they can get out of your body at the same time, that can kill you. So they have to provide the platform for your body to start functioning correctly, and start getting rid of these toxins or things like that, or parasites and such, so that it starts happening, then they can work with it a little faster. Because the body’s already doing it. So it’s not going to go into shock. So I can say over the years, I’ve learned to take it as kind of a giggle, instead of a criticism. Well, they’ll get it, because I’ve watched people get it. And all of a sudden, their life just changes, that little bit of grace offered. And all of a sudden they become quite positive. And they get the twinkle in their eye, you know. And it’s just, it’s lovely to watch that,\xa0 that’s why I keep doing this, even though it’s very difficult to see the depravity of the human condition. But it’s why I forget sessions, and then we call the gift of forgiving, because if I remembered all that stuff, I would be haunted by it. And I’d start manifesting it. So I forget sessions, I even forget a lot of your session, and that was just a couple of weeks ago. What’s important for me is to remain in that enlightened place, and to be aware of my soul’s personality and that keeps me protected, and helping people. \xa0 [1:46:14] Ashley James: There’s this medical intuitive who’s become quite famous for telling the entire population of the world that everyone would benefit from drinking celery juice, he has single-handedly doubled the price of celery in the last year. You cannot find really nice the organic celery. Really nice. I mean, it’s all bear pickens now because there’s a whole New Age movement of people juicing celery in the morning, and I’ve heard some really interesting results. It helps the body to create better stomach acid and alkalizes the body at the same time. So it’s the building blocks for helping make good strong stomach acid which of course corrects the digestive tract, and also is going to help, any kind of juice really helps the body to become alkaline. But his thing is 100% of the population should drink celery juice in his opinion. So what I’d like to know, have you ever received advice from the guides or angels, that is like a blanket, 100% of the population would benefit from X? \xa0 \xa0 [1:47:32] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yes. Often, but it ain’t going to happen. It’s like the guy recommending celery juice. Well, if we all drink tons of celery juice, one, there’d be no celery left. But two, if you have too much celery juice, there’s problems from that too. A certain amount of It’s good. It’s like eating papaya, amazing for your flora in your intestine, phenomenal. But people don’t like papaya, they get sick of celery juice. Celery juice is an energy. You can also bring in that same energy. My doctor knows me, he goes, “Eric, you can either do this, you can take this pill, or you can touch the pill. Or you can hold on to the bottle. Or you can just think about it if you want.” Because he knows that that medicine is a frequency that might help me. And I can actually refine that frequency. That’s how Homeopaths work. That’s how the placebo effects work. Because you think it’s the sugar pill is a certain frequency. You pull it in, you get better. Because the pill would actually, if it was a real pill, it would be a certain frequency. So the celery juice, yeah, it’s providing a certain frequency. It’s like in Japan, they go through this thing where everyone goes walking through the forests, it’s the frequency of the forest, we can do it here too. It makes you feel better, it can make everything work better. It does, so does celery juice. Only, do you need to drink celery juice every day? Wouldn’t hurt you if you didn’t drink too much. And for those whose bodies are not clear, whose bodies are having problems with the digestion, if they get cleared, like you’ve got cleared, that thing was bothering your digestion, celery juice might help for a while. But after a while, your body figured it out and can grow its own thing that was influenced the celery juice influenced. So your body can literally start doing it by itself. So that’s why these fads come and go. Celery juice is something that went through, it went through about 10 years ago. And then I remember when I was a teen, it was all about celery. And they come and go because the next generation hasn’t heard it yet. So the previous generation that heard it needs to be reminded. And so yeah, I’ve heard the celery juice story and it’s true. But do we need it all, all the time? No, we don’t. Would a lot of people benefit from it currently? You bet. \xa0 \xa0 [1:50:19] Ashley James:\xa0Is there anything similar to the celery juice that people would largely benefit from? \xa0 \xa0 [1:50:24] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yes. We recommend when the guide say too, the whole food plant based diet. That is the best. And it is the only scientifically proven diet with proponents as evidence. All the massive studies done at Harvard, Stanford, Oxford, paid for by nonprofits, not for profit; for a Center for Disease Control, World Health Organization. So there’s no commercial influence in the biases of the studies, we all have is cognitive bias. So if Bear is paying for a study on sugar, they’re going to want certain information from that study. So the study isn’t neutral on sugar, they’re only going to look at what they want. \xa0 \xa0 [1:51:12 ] Ashley James:\xa0Like, there are companies that make food like Nestle or Kellogg or, you know, these major food companies that pay for studies, health studies on sugar, and diet. And you’ve got to imagine that there’s definitely an influence there. They want to prove that there’s a certain amount of sugar that’s safe. \xa0 \xa0 [1:51:35] Eric Thorton:\xa0Right. And the World Health Organization has determined there’s no amount of sugar that is safe. And sugar does give you benefit. It raises your blood sugar really quickly. And so the Nestle’s will go on that, how did it do that? So emphasize that, but we’ll forget that when your blood sugar goes up really fast, it causes terrible growth in your body, causes insulin resistance, etc, etc. and changes your pH so cancer can grow and things like that. They’ll ignore that part of the study, because all their studies are based on the studies from whole food plant base, from that group. And that is ultimately what is best for every human being. Does every human being have to eat that way to live a long life? No. There are 10% in their studies that show that eating a non whole food plant based diet, those 10% of the people will not get heart disease from eating the standard American diet, we call it. But they will still develop all the other problems, bad knees, bad hips, you know, diabetes, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome issues, and then all the hundred and 80 different diseases, including various cancers that eating this standard American causes. So like sometimes they say, well, this person isn’t going to change. So let’s see if we can say okay, you can eat meat, but just a smaller amount, and up the antioxidants by eating vegetables and fruits. And then see if we can get them to reduce their sugar and things like that. And they will get healthier, and they might live to be 94 and 95 with a good heart. But they’ll have all these other problems too. But it keeps them going. But ultimately, when I ran into that, years ago, the guides went, that is what the human body needs. Period. With that said, People don’t follow it. Oreo cookies, they’re not whole food plant based but they are vegan. And they are vegetarian, and they will kill you. Or they’ll develop their diet with “Well, this person said this is okay. And this one said this is okay.” And they’re back to the commercialism. And they slowly change it back to and they say see my diet failed. \xa0 \xa0 [1:54:08] Ashley James:\xa0Right. Oh, I have even done that before. But I’ve seen people do that where we can justify. Like Dr. Mark Hyman who I’ve had on the show, says meat is fine as long as we use like a condiment, and even Joel Fuhrman who himself does not eat meat, but he says if you could at least make less than 10% of your caloric intake be meat. And that really does help and so, Joel Fuhrman chooses not to eat meat, Dr. Mark Hyman, both of them have been on the show before. Mark says, you know, yeah, okay, just sprinkle a little bit of meat on something, like sprinkle it on a vegetarian taco or whatever. And his thing is, just don’t make a whole meal around the meat like most people do. And so if you pick and choose, you’re like, Okay, over here is the Mediterranean diet. So I’m going to eat some fish, then overhears the Atkins Oh, well, so I’m going to avoid some bread, and then over here, and you just kind of pick and choose. And then you’re messing everything up, you need to find something that is grounded in science. And they’re saying that the whole food plant based diet is healthy for 100% of the population. They need to make sure they’re actually doing it. \xa0 \xa0 [1:55:19] Eric Thorton:\xa0Right. They sit here, it’s like the lady who called, she was doing this because she had heart problems. And she’s going, you know, I’m talking to her six weeks later, nothing’s happening. She’s doing oil pulling. So she’s putting oil in her mouth for an hour a day, to pull toxins out of our system. Well, it’s going down her throat. And oil is one of the things you can’t eat, nobody should eating oil. The pseudoscience say you get all these benefits from the oil. Well, it’s what’s in the oil that’s giving you the benefit. It’s like your omegas, those are chemicals. They’re not oil, you need the Omegas, but they’re chemicals, they happen to come out of the plants, or some animal has a few omegas in them, in the oil easiest. So then they sell you the oil. \xa0 \xa0 [1:56:07] Ashley James: Well like EFAs or just basically juiced fish, right? \xa0 \xa0 [1:56:13] Eric Thorton:\xa0They’re in broccoli. \xa0 \xa0 [1:56:14] Ashley James:\xa0Right. Well and that’s how sardines and how salmon get to have so many Omegas in their flesh. They eat algae. So we can skip the middleman and just… \xa0 \xa0 [1:56:26 ] Ashley James:\xa0Or they eat fish that had eaten algae. Exactly, or other green. Algae is generally green or brown, and it has the Omegas in it. So we can get all the you know, EFAs, DHAS, CoQ10, all these oils – I mean all these chemicals, without the oil. That’s what’s good for us. But because it’s easier for commercialism to get it in the oil, it takes a whole huge step process to pull it out of the oil. So it’s far cheaper. So feed them the oil, and keep telling them to have the oil because it’s easiest to get it into. But the oil scientifically shows its mother’s the bacteria in your intestine. And then you can’t digest grains, or the meat very well. The oil smothers the probiotics in your intestines that need air in order to live. It coats them so they can’t pull the air in. That’s the reason you can’t have oil. Because how many billion dollar industry is the probiotic industry and the vitamin industry? If you can’t get the nutrition because you don’t have the probiotics to get it, just take another pill, just buy this from us. No, you can’t get it from those things, you have to get it, you got to get the probiotics right by not eating the darn oil. And one of the reasons meat is so bad because even boneless skinless chicken is 30% fat, which is oil. That’s one of the reasons you can’t eat meat, it’s so bad for us. Sprinkled on things, like the way Asians used to eat, for the whole family, they use six ounces of meat. If you do that from birth, you don’t develop the problems as much, you still will develop a little bit, but not nearly as much. They call those the Blue Zones, the areas where people eat more primitive. When you get more affluent, you start wanting the things that are richer. So the diets of people that are poor, are actually better than the diets of the rich people, because the rich people want the creams, the things that put on fat, because our body wants to have a big bank account. And it’s like you put on that oil and you hold the oil in these oil cells. There are several things that go on with this. The fat cells, you can read about this in the book China Study, this is all scientifically shown. The fat cells, our bodies produce the fat cell, but it cannot fill it up. So this hasn’t been on Good Morning America talking about this. When you cut into a person, you’re cutting those fat cells. And it’s rancid oil, and they stink. \xa0 \xa0 [1:59:42] Ashley James:\xa0That’s what surgeons say. \xa0 \xa0 [1:59:42] Eric Thorton:\xa0Right. That’s what surgeons say, it’s this rancid oil. So your body once it gets it in there, it gets rancid and the body doesn’t wanna let go of it. Because it’s actually rancid, it’s poisonous. That’s why we have such a hard time losing weight and easy time gaining it. So if you eliminate the oil from your diet, it will use the oil slowly in your system so that you will have enough oil. Our bodies cannot fill those fat cells up with something that is human. And so eating all this oil also literally fills up those cells. And if you stop eating it, your cells deflate. And eventually the cell itself will go away. Or you have liposuction and get them removed or whatever. But it is a problem. Now the other thing that happens is we are also the only mammal on the planet that doesn’t produce our own antioxidants. Antioxidants are what kill the major part of your immune system. They kill viruses, bacteria, they keep systemic diseases under control. And when you don’t eat those fruits and veggies, you are susceptible to major diseases and illness. \xa0 [2:01:01] Ashley James:\xa0You’re talking about vitamin C. Animals produce their own vitamin C, but humans can’t. \xa0 \xa0 [2:01:05] Eric Thorton:\xa0Correct. That’s exactly right. And so we have to eat them. And that’s the premise and let me backup a little bit. When you eat the food as a whole product, your body can use the whole thing and use everything, we talked about it a little bit, last time we talked about how an apple, you get 50 milligrams of vitamin C out of an average apple. And if you extract that, you get a 50 milligram raise in your vitamin C level in your blood. But if you eat the whole apple, you get a 1500 milligram raise of vitamin C levels in your blood, because your body uses the whole apple just like photosynthesis does. It’s photosynthesis taking place. And it’s growing all these chemicals inside the apple making the apple. Where your body will utilize all that produce till the right digestive enzymes to put in to get the body to make more vitamin C out of the chemicals in an apple. Just like the photosynthesis did, or similar. Can’t say just like, we don’t have light shining on us like that. And we’re not green, unless we’re really sick. But it does a similar thing. And that’s why it’s called whole food. They don’t want you taking supplements unless there’s a major reason for it. Because it’s away from the whole food. That’s why this diet is the one that is good for every human being. Yes, you can throw in a little if you’re not sick. In other words, if you’re young. So my daughter has chosen to do this on her own, no parental influence. And then we can prove it because our son still eat some meat and she decided to do this. And it changed the way she feels, the speed of which she runs, the way she can build muscle and everything because she’s getting enough antioxidants. Her body’s alkaline now, and so it can function properly. And she can have because she’s young, she doesn’t have any illnesses. So like when she went to Ireland, she tried their sausages. You know, when she’s out, she doesn’t have to panic about oil. She try to order things without oil. But if there’s oil, if that’s all there is, she’ll eat it. But she’s young and doesn’t have heart disease, or deteriorated joints yet, metabolic syndrome yet. So she’s continuous like that. She will probably never get any of these major diseases until she’s 95. That’s terrific. And that’s what Fuhrman’s talking about, if you can do it from early on, didn’t hurt you so much. \xa0 \xa0 [2:03:52] Ashley James:\xa0I had Dr. Esselstyn on the show, really great interview. He is great. I’ve had three cardiologists on the show, all have sort of very different different takes on how to heal the hurt, all of them get results, but Dr. Esselstyn gets the most results. Anyone listening who has any problems with a heart health or any friends with heart health or family, definitely share, listen to and share the Dr. Esselstyn interview that I did. And by the way, if you don’t know how to find it, you can go to\xa0www.learntruehealth.com\xa0and type in cardiologist and use the search bar or type in Dr. Esselstyn, use the search bar to find the episode. He did the world’s longest study. I believe it was over 12 years old or it’s still going on. I think he wrote it up after 12 years. But yeah, he took a bunch of people who had end stage heart disease four clogs in their heart, you know, absolutely end stage. And he got them on this diet, whole foods plant based, no salt, sugar, oil. And by whole food, I mean, you can make really delicious food out of it, it’s just whole ingredient. Here’s a whole broccoli, here’s a whole asparagus, you know, and you’re not cooking with oil or fat, you’re cooking with broth that\xa0 doesn’t have salt in it or water. And you can actually saute something as though it had butter or oil in it using a little bit of water. And so he has these cooking techniques. But in his diet, he has been able to reverse clogs in the arteries and completely reverse hardening of the arteries, the narrowing of the arteries, he’s been able to get people off of the heart transplant list and off of medications using this diet. And they follow people for years to prove that, that it sustains the results. \xa0 \xa0 [2:05:52] Eric Thorton:\xa0Right. Exactly. I’m one of those patients. I don’t know if he took down the statistics because this was six years ago. Now that was when I talked to him was four years ago. And I’ve talked to him number of times since. I was what he called the walking dead. I was scheduled for literally two days when I talked to him for open heart surgery, I already had a massive heart attack. And the guides corrected it. I had no signs of the heart attack, but I still developed the coronary artery disease. I was vegetarian. I still had coconut oil, little bit, one teaspoon. I had egg whites in the morning for breakfast, when I put the coconut oil in the pan. And I had an occasional piece of cheese like once every two weeks, and maybe a little bit of lunch meat once a week. That was it. As far as anything else. Everything else was healthy vegetarian. Not crap vegetarian, I still developed more coronary artery disease. So on the way to see a whole food plant based cardiologist, we had called, and my wife had called, and he called back right literally in the lobby going to the cardiologist place. And he goes, “I know that guy, he’s good.” And he goes, “What are you doing?” I said, “Well, we switched to whole food plant base, because of pump head because of all the problems of this open heart surgery.” And I was ready for it. And he goes, “Okay, he goes, you’re doing that. Now I want you to add to it.” So he says, “My latest book is going to have this in it. It’s out now, I don’t know the name of it. But it has this part in it too.” He had me ate six cups of green steamed vegetables packed after they were steamed a day on top of my regular vegan diet or whole food plant based diet. \xa0 \xa0 [2:07:47] Ashley James: And did he have you sprinkle balsamic on it? \xa0 \xa0 [2:07:50] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yes, yeah. He explains that in our interview. He has people eat every two hours as they made a whole bowl of steamed greens. He has like 12 greens choose from and you rotate them. And every T is basically a full time job, every two hours, you get to eat this big bowl of greens, and then you sprinkle it with balsamic. And I never liked balsamic until he explained why that there’s an acid in balsamic that heals the inner lining of our circulatory system is healed by this acid from the balsamic. And he’s found that, that is even more effective for immediately helping to clear up the arteries. Right. So I did exactly that, and within three days the angina went away. Within three months, 90 days, 90 days, right? I was off of five medications that were serious medication for heart disease. I was completely off off of them. The doctor goes, “Stop.” I’d cut reduce my blood pressure medication, and reduce and cut in half and cut because the blood pressure was getting too low. And finally I go in, I’m taking a quarter of the dose and he goes, “Stop it, you’re killing yourself.” The veins had opened up that fast. \xa0 \xa0 [2:09:12] Ashley James: The doctor wanted to stop the drugs or stop the diet? \xa0 \xa0 [2:09:14] Eric Thorton:\xa0The doctors stopped the drugs. They told me stop taking them. You’re getting too healthy. I’m sitting there going, “Yes!” But that’s, you know, for me, that is a big thing for me. So I can stick to the diet or stick to the lifestyle quite easily. Because I think, well if I eat that oil, is it going to give me a heart attack? Now I know it won’t, at this point because my arteries are cleared up. And I’ve now proven had gone through the tests. The arteries are cleared up. But I’m susceptible to it. I have those genes. So and I know it and I know the effect. I’ve experienced the effect. It’s hard for people who haven’t experienced a major illness to define the motivation to do this. I get it. That’s not a problem for me. But if you can do it like even Dr. Esselstyn says Dr. Lyle and Dr. McDougall, if you can do it 70% of the time, you’re 70% better off. If you can do it 80, 80%, 90, 90%. You know Dr. Esselstyn, and it was hilarious. He goes, “My only draw, my only real weakness is every New Year’s Eve I ate peanut butter cups.” I just cracked, I go, “Really it’s peanut butter cups? He goes, “Yes. I just love peanut butter cups.” “Are they Trader Joe’s peanut butter cups? Because those are the ones that I like.” And he goes, “No, they’re Reese’s.” And I go, “Good for Reese’s.” But he even admits it, basically. It’s hard. And his family, his parents died really young from a dairy farm they used to have, you know, and it’s like, “Aw.” You know? And so, you know, he’s terrific. \xa0 \xa0 [2:11:00] Ashley James:\xa0Yeah. \xa0 \xa0 [2:11:01] Eric Thorton:\xa0And he does return phone calls. \xa0 \xa0 [2:11:03] Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, he does. Actually, I’ve heard that from a few people. I met Rip, his son. Rip Esselstyn, who has a whole line of food at Whole Foods. \xa0 \xa0 [2:11:14] Eric Thorton:\xa0Engine 2. \xa0 \xa0 [2:11:14] Ashley James:\xa0Engine 2, that’s right.\xa0 A book, a very interesting book. And I met him at a talk he gave in Redmond at Whole Foods. The first thing you said is and there’s maybe about 50 people, “Who here has talked on the phone with my dad?” And like half of them put up their hand and he goes, “Yeah, you call him, he’ll talk to anyone.” And he still works as a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, teaching people and he’s in his late 90s, or in his 80s. \xa0 \xa0 [2:11:42] Eric Thorton:\xa0I think he’s 84 or 86 now. \xa0 \xa0 [2:11:44] Ashley James:\xa0He talks about going skiing in the Alps or something. I mean that’s the diet, it keeps you healthy. So I have a listener, and if he’s listening, hello! I have a listener who is a career military man and he was going to be honorably discharged because his cardiac numbers were so bad. I mean, he looks physically fit, like a marine or Green Beret or something. But his cholesterol was so high that they were going to dismiss him and other numbers were so high, unresponsive to medication so high, and he would have lost his career in the military. And he heard my interview with Dr. Esselstyn, he got on the diet one month later, his numbers were normal. \xa0 \xa0 [2:12:30] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yes, exactly. That’s what happens. They do the 21 day challenge. In 21 days, if you eat strict, they actually take people and they feed them, house them and everything for 21 days, take their blood before and after 21 days, it has dropped so dramatically. All these numbers, that they just sit there and go, “Oh, my God.” And guess what? They weren’t hungry, and they had great food. So, you know, it’s you do have to learn a new way of cooking. People go, “I can’t do it. I said, “Baloney. You learn these recipes. So you’re just learning more recipes.” You just stop cooking these recipes and you cook these ones. That’s all it is. It’s not hard. The hard part is like even Esselstyn will say or Fuhrman is the addiction to the oil and the meat. \xa0 \xa0 [2:13:23] Ashley James:\xa0And if your addiction has a voice behind it, then come see Eric. \xa0 \xa0 [2:13:27] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yes, because it is. It affects that. Because again, the predatory energy was to prevent you from continuing with your process. Well, it had me two feet in the grave, fortunately, I was still standing. Because it wanted to stop me from bringing my knowledge to the world. And I almost didn’t make it. \xa0 \xa0 [2:13:57] Ashley James:\xa0But now looking back, I mean, you could either and this is the lesson for all of us, we can either give into the drama of what was me, this thing happened to me or is happening to, or has happened to me and my family, which creates an energy that brings in like energy, right? So it brings in thought forms and entities of other energy to kind of compound and exacerbate that drama. Or you can do what you’re doing and say that you’re grateful for the experience that you went through. Because now I mean, if you hadn’t had those heart issues, would you have found this diet? Would you have, you know, been this way that you’ve now helped your family and now you help your clients this way. So it’s a ripple effect. But you’re looking at the ripple effect with gratitude and seeing that. What’s the positive outcome? Tony Robbins, and I love him for this. He says what’s good about this? When things start to have drama, ask what’s good about this? And keep asking yourself, what’s good about this until you find the positive meaning behind that experience. \xa0 \xa0 [2:15:05] Eric Thorton:\xa0Well, that was a major thing that happened to me when I had the heart attack. And I’m standing there and I went pale as a piece of paper. Because I have a connection to the guides, because I went totally pale. I mean, literally, all life drained right out of me. And I go, “Am I having a heart attack?” And they go, “Yup.” And I literally go, “Damn.” And then I called my daughter to get me some aspirin and I wasn’t upset about it. I didn’t allow myself to get upset. I knew what happened. I have the privilege. And I know it’s a privilege. I fully acknowledge it. I know, it’s okay, when you don’t have a body. And I know this is a tool. And I’m very grateful for this tool. But it’s not a problem for me not having that tool anymore. And so I’m laying there in the hospital room, and I could go to anxiety and worry and raise my blood pressure and raise my heart rate when I’m down to a 7% ejection rate on the left side of my heart. And that would just simply kill me. So I decided to honor the body and its process and what I knew I was going to be learning. And I was lying there in bed dying. I got congestive heart failure and double pneumonia, called the nurse and to give me some oxygen because I didn’t have enough oxygen anymore. I’m lying there dying, I’m whistling. And my wife goes, “That was arrogant.” I go, “Well, no. It wasn’t.” That wasn’t arrogant at all. That’s who I am. And I really felt that way. I didn’t even think about it. It was just like, “Oh, this is what I’m going through now. I wonder what I’m going to be learning later, this is going to be interesting.” And I thought you know, it’s a better attitude for the body. So I don’t stress it. And like, well, it all works good. And I lived. And then the guides had a chance to correct the heart. And which they did,\xa0 fortunately. We have great success with heart disease in the work we do. But anyway, I have learned so much from that is unbelievable to help my clients. I have learned things I would never have learned if I wasn’t forced into it from the heart attack. And they protected me during the whole process. And that’s what we have to turn these negativity immediately into the positivity. Like you were taught in that class with Tony and probably other people too, what’s the benefit. And that keeps you in, keeps you out of the drama, the human drama, and into the moment. You know, I wasn’t thinking about, I thought you know, I really don’t want to die yet. But I told everybody, I’ll be back to haunt you. And you’ll notice me because there’ll be a sense of humor. And they go, “Okay.” You know my daughter goes, “Oh, when you die? It’s gonna be hilarious.” I go, “You betcha.” Because I will make darn sure every painting is tipped, the TV flips out, the doors open and close. I’ll make sure that when you, because one of my favorite things is strawberries and blueberries. I’ll make sure you dump them on the floor. Just to let you know give some to dad. Because it is, it’s a natural thing for us to do. We do it all, we do it with every life. It’s just we’re taught not to. And we’re talking about Esselstyn and how the gift he’s giving the world in realizing that our cardiological system is designed to keep ill. \xa0 [2:19:02] Ashley James:\xa0Oh, you mean the mainstream medical system? \xa0 \xa0 [2:19:04] Eric Thorton:\xa0Correct. It’s designed to keep us patients. And it’s not bad doctors. It’s what the system is teaching. You know, my cardiologist I had before, after the heart attack, before the whole food plant based, he had knowledge. But he had to operate to keep his license within the rules of the American Medical Association as a cardiologist. So he couldn’t tell me certain things. So when I did show up needing bypass surgery, he was the one doing the work. He was my cardiologist. And we come out of surgery. He goes, you need to have bypass surgery. Here’s the doctor to do it. He’s the best in the State. He’s blah, blah, blah. He couldn’t, and he was the best doctor in the state. And so he connected me up really well. My wife said to him, “But couldn’t we change that with diet?” And he said, “Yes, but it would take three years.” It had been three years since the heart attack. \xa0 \xa0 [2:20:06] Ashley James: And he could have told you three years ago, but he didn’t. \xa0 \xa0 [2:20:09] Eric Thorton: He didn’t. He didn’t. Because if he did, I could sue him. Because the American Medical Association had not recommended yet whole food plant based. He knew it. But he couldn’t recommend it. They can now, American Medical Association now recommends whole food plant based for heart disease. So he can say it now, but he couldn’t then. And I never went back to him. Because he was a good man. He really was. I don’t have a problem with him. But he left that little things slip that he should have let slip three years before because he knew me. He knew I was willing to do anything. And I could stick with things. But he didn’t. \xa0 \xa0 [2:21:01] Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, I want all my doctors to be renegades just enough to be okay with telling me the truth. Right and they damn the potential consequences. Tell me the truth. \xa0 \xa0 [2:21:13] Eric Thorton:\xa0Right. Or at least look for it themselves. So these doctors are now exposed, like the rest of us are to the various ideas of food and nutrition. And yet they’ve only had 20 minutes of nutrition in their becoming doctors, according to Esselstyn is 20 minutes. And it may be a whole class. Okay, great. But it’s like, okay, but this is out there. So why the resistance to study in this? They sit there and they go with the whole food plant based. Well, Dr… What’s the name? Who started The China Study? Dr… I forgot his name right now, he’s a PhD. He’s not an MD. So all the research is flawed. That’s literally what they say. But he brought in, he was a PhD at Stanford, he brought in the doctors to do the studies. He was just the orchestrator. He did a magnificent job. And it’s the only sound science on nutrition on the planet. And it’s evidence based nutrition. And the evidence was gathered by long term scientific studies. And that the guides have gone. That’s what the human bodies need. They were very specific about it, though. We used to live short lives, it didn’t matter. Now, we’re trying to live these long lives for humans. We’re trying to live past 50. In 1900, the average American, the statistics show, lived to be 47 years old. You couldn’t get year round fruits and vegetables then, now you can. And that’s actually doing that. And sanitation is why we live longer, because we’re getting the antioxidants year round now. So don’t mess with Mexico. Sorry, that was an editorial. \xa0 \xa0 [2:23:13] Ashley James:\xa0No. I just thought when the tariffs were being threatened, I was like, “You know what, all these people with their avocado obsession, what’s gonna happen?” Like, don’t take away my avocados. \xa0 \xa0 [2:23:26] Eric Thorton:\xa0You know, you gotta have the strawberry, but it is, those are antioxidants. And avocados are very good for you. You take them away, you’re eliminating some of what we need for year round food. And that is what increased our longevity. People have recently in the last 15 years, started doing all these other diets. And now, the average lifespan has dropped three years, literally, because of all these other diets. \xa0 \xa0 [2:23:52] Ashley James:\xa0Like Atkins and keto. \xa0 \xa0 [2:23:54] Eric Thorton:\xa0Right. High meat diets. If you go online, and you look at a vial of blood, someone that’s on the high fat, high protein diet – half the blood, it separates out, half of it is the fat they ate. That is like taking sandpaper to the inside of your arteries. But we don’t care about that. I do. And people that are doing that much, their bodies care about it. They’re just not aware of it until they have an event. Not fully aware of it. Constipation does develop to be a problem on those diets. And they do, they shock your body into losing weight. There’s no question about that for a while. And then it starts, the antioxidants go down, the vitamins and minerals go down. And then you start getting unhealthy. So anyway, it’s a sad process. And I have learned tremendously from the gift of my heart attack and it was a gift. There’s no question about it. \xa0 \xa0 [2:24:59] Ashley James:\xa0Today, we got to learn from the gift of your heart attack as well. So thank you, thank you for sitting with us and sharing so much wonderful information and stories. The takeaway being that, if we have loved ones ashes, let them go so that we become healthier and that the soul of our ancestors can move on into a better place for our benefit, for their benefit. All the way around. Good for everyone, that we need to focus on gaining the positive learnings and being grateful in the now so that we can vibrate at that frequency that attracts like. So the more evolved, less coming from ego, coming from a more soul stance or our soul’s purpose, right? So we need to focus on gaining all the positive learnings and not attaching to the drama. \xa0 \xa0 [2:26:01] Eric Thorton:\xa0Focus on the grace of every event like these public speakers talk about, you focus on positivity, there’s a real truth to that. You can’t be there all the time. So don’t punish yourself for not being able to do it. But the more you stay in that, the more your frequency is that and you’re going to draw less predatory or lower frequency energy. That’s how you stay safe. \xa0 \xa0 [2:26:28] Ashley James:\xa0And then the final message would be, do a 21 day challenge and try the whole food plant based diet, no salt, sugar or oil. I interviewed chef AJ on the show and she’s a delight. Definitely, listeners can go back and search Chef AJ in the search box at\xa0www.learntruehealth.com\xa0to find that episode. And then Dr. Goldhamer who I remember the number of that one, it’s Episode 230. I remember that because my husband’s joke is when’s the best time to go to the dentist? 230 your tooth 30 you know. My husband’s full of dad jokes. But yeah, so Episode 230 is Dr. Goldhamer and he teaches this but Chef AJ and there’s some great YouTube videos of the two of them Chef AJ and Dr. Goldhamer together, Chef AJ teaches, I think she says over 100 or more videos where she teaches from start to finish how to cook delicious lunches and snacks and breakfasts and dinners using this whole foods plant based diet, no salt, sugar, or oil, and she also adds no alcohol as well. Which is literally a poison. So while you do your 21 day challenge, cut out alcohol as well, because it is considered sugar and a toxin to the liver. But that together in 21 days, creates like a whole new body, a whole new experience. \xa0 \xa0 [2:28:00] Eric Thorton: It’s phenomenal. I’ve met them both personally, because I went to True North and went through the process down there. So that’s where all these doctors congregate, share information, they have labs there, they have rooms, I did 21 day fast with a 14 day refeed. So I spent a lot of time and I got all those lectures and saw Chef AJ and listen to her and all the other things. And they’re fascinating people, and they have the best intentions. They do have the intention, that’s a good intention. If people don’t want to hear it, they’re not going to hear it. So why bother? And that’s the way the guides are too, you know, I told you if they’re not going to do it, let’s see if we can modify it a little bit and get a little bit healthier. But the people aren’t going to listen. That’s it. \xa0 \xa0 [2:28:14] Ashley James:\xa0Right. \xa0 \xa0 [2:28:53] Eric Thorton:\xa0And Goldhamer is big on that. And Chef AJ went through the 21 day fast, and she has to remain very strict in order to keep weight off. She was like, very, very heavy at one time. And her body cannot tolerate even oils in avocados and nuts and things like that. Otherwise, she’ll balloon up again and she does it right away. And I don’t know why because I’ve never worked on her. So she has to be very strict. So actually, her recipes are actually really good. Only because she can’t cheat. And so they are they’re very good recipes. I have one of her cookbooks. I think I have two. She did one with Ramsey, Chef Ramsay and her and then I have one of hers too. And they’re very good. So I’m a cook too. So I always spice things up and things like that. But I use all these recipe books for their basic recipe. And then I’ll fine tune it. But her recipes are good and sound the way they are. So, but again, I like to mess with things a little. \xa0 \xa0 [2:30:07] Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, you got a gorgeous kitchen for that. \xa0 \xa0 [2:30:09] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yeah, I do. We have a commercial kitchen that allows us to do that and get those flavors and things like that. So, but it is. She does the demonstrations on hot plates. She doesn’t do it on a big fancy stove. She’s got it right there and she’s got your coils that you plug into the wall, you know, and just regular electric hot plate. So anyone can do it. You can go buy a hot plate if you need to. \xa0 \xa0 [2:30:37] Ashley James:\xa0She gives some great advice. She says make all your seasonings in advance like, she buys all her seasoning, let’s say sage and garlic and ground onion and all the different kinds of spices. And she will get them in bulk for example. And then take these containers and make her blends for the next week. Sort of like someone would take their 20 supplement bottles or their 10 prescription bottles and make up a little holder. You know, she does that with her seasoning. So she knows she’s going to make chili on Thursday, she just grabs her bottle of pre made chili seasoning and just throws it in. And I thought that was really smart to kind of make her make her own blends. So there’s no salt in it, there’s no sugar in it, there’s no oil in it, I can’t believe how many spices out there are filled with crap. So she makes her own. And then she doesn’t have to… it takes less time for her to cook because she just grabs one thing and pours, dumps the whole pile of spice right there on the food while she’s cooking it. \xa0 [2:31:43] Eric Thorton:\xa0She’s a professional cook. So she has that all worked out for a certain flavor. Most people can’t do that. They don’t plan ahead that far. And they can’t think of what they’re doing, until they actually do it. She happens to be able to do that which is really nice where she buys a lot of her spices, give them a plug it’s called Savory Spice. And they do have a lot of blends that have salt or sugar in or something but they also have a lot to do not. And they have some very, very interesting spices. And they recommend you at True North Health to go to Savory Spice, that’s about 10 blocks from that facility. And they have their own blend that Savory Spice makes for True Health. And that you have on your table to just put spice on your food, herbal blend, and it’s a nice one that doesn’t have to be cooked to flavor your food. And they have several of those and Savory Spice is the place that they get all these and they’re organic and they’re you know the whole works and so you go in and you say I want whole food plant based, no sugar, oil or salt like, “Okay, we got this this this this and this.” And there’s some really amazing blends, they have Japanese blends, they got Korean, they got Middle Eastern, and you know they got all kinds from all over the world that have no sugar, oil or salt. \xa0 \xa0 [2:33:04] Ashley James:\xa0Oh I have to check them out. They probably sell them online. \xa0 \xa0 [2:33:10] Eric Thorton:\xa0I was thinking they were in Santa Rosa where True North Health is. And so it’s like, I lost their phone number so look it up online there’s one at Alderwood Mall. \xa0 \xa0 2:33:22] Ashley James:\xa0So they are a chain. \xa0 \xa0 [2:33:23] Eric Thorton:\xa0They’re a chain. I’ve been sitting here ordering. It’s like I get the privilege of now walking in. Because you go in it’s like this place smells good. So anyway, I found that out I go, “Okay, why can’t you tell me that sooner, guys?” \xa0 \xa0 [2:33:45] Ashley James:\xa0You give talks in Redmond. So local people are listening can check out your website and get on your newsletter at\xa0www.ericthorton.com\xa0and come to your free lectures. I know the next one’s coming up in a few weeks. \xa0 \xa0 [2:33:58] Eric Thorton:\xa0And I think you said you were going to record it, maybe? \xa0 \xa0 [2:34:00] Ashley James:\xa0We’re going to do our best. \xa0 \xa0 [2:34:01] Eric Thorton:\xa0Okay. So we might be able to put the whole lecture or discussion, I have a more open discussion. So it’s more interesting. I think lectures can get a little boring. \xa0 \xa0 [2:34:14] Ashley James:\xa0Well, not you. I can’t imagine you being boring. But we’ll do our best to record it. Thank you so much for sitting with us. \xa0 \xa0 [2:34:21] Eric Thorton:\xa0Thank you. \xa0 \xa0 [2:34:21] Ashley James:\xa0And teaching, this has been a lot of fun.

Like I told you earlier had a guy today, the call from Saudi Arabia that’s doesn’t wanna get in trouble in Saudi Arabia. So he’s going to either the UK in August, so he wants an appointment in August and he listened to you. That was the latest podcast. So that was Sunday. So I think he listened Monday and he called yesterday. So I get quite a bit of that and it’s really fun to help your clients. \xa0 \xa0 [2:35:04] Ashley James:\xa0Yeah, that’s what I’m all about. Let’s help all the listeners to get true health. \xa0 \xa0 [2:35:10] Eric Thorton:\xa0Yeah.

Free radicals and oxidative damage to the brain is by no means the only cause of cognitive problems and functional decline in your brain With the help of certain nootropics or supplements, you can increase your chances. Whole foods plant-based diets with healthy fats support brain health. Taking the right nootropic supplements can optimize your brain health and protect you from cognitive decline well into the future. It is never too late to start taking supplements.  \xa0 Do you find yourself at times challenged at remembering the things you used to know and even used to really master at life? Memory loss? You would be shocked to discover that it is not a normal part of aging. Today’s podcast will help you understand why and how the decline in brain function starts and basically what to do when realizing that you’re not a sharp as you once were. \xa0 [00:00] Ashley James:\xa0Hello, True Health seeker and welcome to another exciting episode of Learn True Health podcast. Today, wow you are going to love today’s interview. David Tomen comes back on the show to teach us how to reverse and prevent aging of the brain. Science has shown it actually starts in your 20’s and really starts to take hold in our 40’s. You’ve noticed that you don’t think as clearly as you used to or maybe math which is my thing isn’t coming as naturally or as quickly to you as it used to. You want to hear today’s interview with David Tomen because he teaches us exactly how to help heal the brain and to anti-aging on the brain. Also, how to prevent and reverse big issues like Parkinson’s, Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. I know you’re going to love hearing what he has to say. It’s very technical. There’s a lot of science in it and I know you’re probably going to want to take notes. But here’s the thing, we now transcribe all of our interviews. So you can go ahead and go to\xa0learntruehealth.com\xa0and read the transcript for this interview. It’s going to take us a little bit of time between posting it to all of the podcast directories and then getting up on our website but once it’s on our website you’ll be able to read this entire interview which is really exciting. Remember to go to\xa0learntruehealth.com\xa0and check that out because all of the recent episodes have been transcribed for you, which is so great. I know several listeners have told me that they listened to episodes two or three times to take notes. This has been very helpful for them. I want to let you know about two resources because we discussed supplements in this interview specifically magnesium and vitamins. I want to let you know about two of my favorite resources. David mentions in this interview that magnesium is very important for brain health. My favorite source of magnesium is not oral magnesium. It is soaking in magnesium. If you’re a new listener you may have not heard this but if you’ve been around for a while you’ve heard me talk about Kristen Bowen’s magnesium soak which has really been transformative for my life and for my family. Over 2,000 listeners have enjoyed soaking in Kristen’s magnesium and actually come back and told me about it. There’s several threads in our Facebook group, the Learn True Health Facebook group where listeners have shared their positive experience with soaking in the magnesium soak. If you’d like to increase the magnesium in your body because most people are deficient. You’d like to do it without having to take an oral supplement that gives you diarrhea. Let’s be honest, most magnesium supplements do that. You can soak in the magnesium and your body will absorb grams of magnesium every time you soak in it. It’s very concentrated, it’s all-natural, it’s from the Zechstein Sea. You can listen to my interview with Kristen Bowen to learn more about that. You can go to\xa0learntruehealth.com\xa0and type in Kristen Bowen or type in magnesium in the search box and you’ll find those interviews. Go to livingthegoodlifenaturally.com\xa0and use coupon code LTH. That’s the listener coupon code to get your discount and buy a jug of her magnesium soak. It is really transformative. After we introduced it into the bath for our 4-year-old son, he was 3 at that time. He would always fight us every time it was bedtime. After we started adding it to his bath, he would be more relaxed and calm and want to go to sleep. That’s how we felt too. It just relaxes you, it calms you, and it increases sleep. It also increases energy because your body needs it for hundreds of enzymatic processes in the body. Since most people are deficient in magnesium and so many symptoms of magnesium deficiency that could mimic other diseases if you’re experiencing symptoms of anything, you should really try magnesium and try soaking in it. Kristen recommends you do a 30-day challenge. You’d buy one of the jugs and you soak in it every evening for 30 days. I soak in it while I’m in my sauna. You could soak in it while watching TV or when you’re sitting at your desk. Sometimes I do that. I soak while I’m sitting at my desk recording interviews. Just try it and see how you feel and come to the Facebook group. Learn True Health Facebook group and share your experience with soaking in the magnesium. Of course, everything that I’m talking right now is going to be on the show notes of today’s podcast of the\xa0learntruehealth.com. So go to\xa0livingthegoodlifenaturally.com\xa0and use coupon code LTH to try the magnesium soak, which I highly recommend. My second resource for you is where I buy all my vitamins and minerals from, especially my minerals is\xa0takeyoursupplements.com. Go to\xa0takeyoursupplements.com\xa0and fill out the form for a free consultation with a health coach that’ll help you buy the right supplements for you. They specialize in minerals. If you’re looking for a really good trace mineral if you’re looking for a really good selenium complex that is where I’d go. I absolutely highly recommend checking out\xa0takeyoursupplements.com\xa0for those supplements. Excellent. Enjoy today’s interview. I know you will and please share this interview with all of your friends and family who want to have a healthy brain. \xa0 [05:44] Ashley James:\xa0Welcome to the Learn True Health podcast. I’m your host, Ashley James. This is episode 374. I’m very excited for today’s guest. We have back on the show with us Nootropics Expert David Tomen. He was here first in episode 362 where he taught us about how to heal the brain and balance dopamine and serotonin. Very fascinating story that you have David, where you were able to completely reverse your ADHD using natural substances and that it drove you to want to learn how to balance the brain, heal the brain and support the brain using herbs and supplements and food and just understanding more about the chemistry and science about the brain. Which is something that is not explored enough and you just think that we would just focus on the brain more since that is where we live. Right? I’m very excited to have you back in the show today. We’re going to cover some really interesting information that everyone can benefit from. Welcome back, David. \xa0 [06:57] David Tomen:\xa0Hi, Ashley. Thanks for having me back. \xa0 [07:00] Ashley James:\xa0Now, are you sipping your chai tea? We are talking about tea. I’ve got my green tea here I’m sipping. Do you have your organic chai tea you’re sipping right now? \xa0 [07:10]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0 I’ve got another kind of Tazo tea. I think it’s oolong. \xa0 [07:14] Ashley James:\xa0Nice. Okay, there’s oolong in mine too. So, cheers. \xa0 [07:16]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0 Excellent. Cheers. \xa0 [07:17] Ashley James:\xa0And we know that these teas have nice phytonutrients in it for the brain. \xa0 [07:23] David Tomen:\xa0 I think they do. [Laughter] They’ll keep us calm during the podcast and we’ll be able to think quicker and live longer. \xa0 [07:34] Ashley James:\xa0Hold on while I chug mine. [Laughter] \xa0 [07:38]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0 There, you just added two minutes to your life. [Laughter] \xa0 [07:41] Ashley James:\xa0Excellent. David, we were discussing a few days ago what we discussed today and you said, you mentioned, you rattled off some amazing topics all of which I want you to keep coming back on the show to teach but one of them really struck a chord for me and it was the aging brain and how to prevent. How to foresee the signs of it and how to prevent it. How to reverse it. You mentioned things like becoming forgetful or possibly like losing certain skills you used to have and that really struck a chord with me because in my 20s, I was a math whiz. You could throw math at me all day long. I was like a human calculator and now, I can barely add single digits. It’s just I have to like count on my fingers and it’s like, “What happened?” I feel like a part of my brain just shut down and I don’t have access to the same skills that I used to have and I’m approaching 40. I’m not a candidate for dementia hopefully. What’s going on? You have a great explanation so for those who might notice that they’re less sharp than they used to be or they have a bit more brain fog or possibly they’re concerned that they might end up with dementia. You’re here to teach us today how to take care of your brain so that we can reverse its age and become even healthier brain-wise. \xa0 [09:09] David Tomen:\xa0With a little bit of work you can get your math skills back. The thing is that we all know some people that have lived past 90 years old, right? They’ve enjoyed a really well functional brain until the very end so we know it’s possible to maintain a fully optimized brain right throughout our life. Most of us also know that people that have got Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s or Dementia, I’ve got people of my own family. My father-in-law’s’ got Parkinson’s. But neurodegenerative disease affects not just one person either like close family members and your friends impact as well. It’s not just you if your brain feeling is effective it’s everybody in the circle around you. The thing is that the memory loss that you just described is not a normal part of aging. It really isn’t. Recent research in aging and brain function found that as we get older, individual brain molecule cells and cellular circulation and even the physical shape of your brain are affected in some way. Some of these changes are right around your 21stbirthday. If you’re young biohacker listening to this podcast, this podcast is just as much for you as it is for the aging baby boomer or the senior citizen. We know that the brain responds to the same types of insults that we throw at it with as the rest of your body. It gets attacked by stress, nutritional deficiency, poor diet, toxins, not enough exercise and sleep. These things all affect cognition but the human brain has an amazing ability to repair and maintain itself even up to old age. All we have to do is give it what it needs to survive and thrive. That’s kind of like our start. We can all just go through, when I was researching this, I divided it into segments so that it was easier to comprehend and understand. There’s five different segments and we’ll talk about each one of these in plain English so that anybody can understand what we’re talking about and some tips about how to take care of the particular thing. \xa0 [11:35] Ashley James:\xa0Sounds great. \xa0 [11:36]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0 Yes. The first thing that we have to deal with our free radicals and brain aging. Now we’ve got extensive research that shows oxidation of DNA proteins and lipids by free radicals are responsible for functional decline in your brain. As estimated, that 10,000-oxidated interaction between DNA and free radicals in each one of your brain cells occurs every day. But as you get older at least one out of every three proteins per cell is dysfunctional because of oxidative damage. \xa0 [12:14] Ashley James:\xa0Wow. \xa0 [12:16]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0 So free radicals and oxidative damage to the brain is by no means the only cause of cognitive problems but their rule of free radicals and [Inaudible 12:26] dysfunction is a really major issue and it’s fairly simple to take care of it. \xa0 [12:36] Ashley James:\xa0In terms of the free radical damage that happens to the brain. It’s kind of approaching it in all fronts because free radical damage harms the circulation to the brain and also the circulation away from the brain so bringing fresh nutrients to the brain and removing the waste away from the brain. The free radical damage would cause inflammation to all the vasculature that’s sort of one insult to the brain that’s happening every day but then you’re saying it’s also affecting the protein synthesis in the brain and it’s also affecting the DNA itself. \xa0 [13:15]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0 Yes, right down to the DNA. When you think about it, free radicals and oxidation are a normal part of how our brain works because when you are sending oxygen and nutrients into brain cells, into the mitochondria to use the skill, there’s a burning process that takes place. We’re talking about energy production but whenever there’s energy production there’s also waste because once the fatty acids, for example, are used up they’re oxidized fatty acids and we have a built-in immune system that helps flush the stuff out but it gets out of hand as we get older. Our body cannot cope with the free radical, the normal free radical process that’s going on in our system, we can’t cope with the onslaught and if you don’t do something about it, you just don’t catch up cells get damaged and they die. Let’s talk about a couple of things that you can do to help stop this and reverse it. Yes? \xa0 [14:23] Ashley James:\xa0Awesome. Let’s do it. Let’s jump in. \xa0 [14:25] David Tomen:\xa0 All right. Alpha lipoic acid is a naturally-occurring, sulfur-containing fatty acid that is very unique among\xa0antioxidants.\xa0Because it is both water and\xa0fat-soluble. It’s got a unique ability to neutralize free radicals in all cellular environments. This antioxidant can even\xa0reduce brain damage\xa0after a stroke. \xa0 [14:51] Ashley James:\xa0Wow. Very cool. Where does it come from? Alpha lipoic acid? \xa0 [14:54] David Tomen:\xa0 Well, lipoic acid is a naturally occurring fatty acid in your body and what we do know is that lipoic acid helps boost the synthesis of acetylcholine that increases glucose uptake in brain cells. Lipoic acid is actually part of the synthesis of acetylcholine. If you don’t have lipoic acid you cannot synthesize acetylcholine so it’s part of that process. Lipoic acid regenerates other depleted anti-oxidants that are already in your system like vitamins C and E, glutathione and it recycles CoQ10. It reduces inflammation, it gets rid of heavy metals and boosts cellular energy and memory \xa0 [15:40] Ashley James:\xa0Very cool. I just pulled up Alpha lipoic acid is a vitamin-like chemical called an antioxidant. You can get it from yeast, liver, kidney, spinach, broccoli, and potatoes. They are all very good sources of it. You can have it also use it as a supplement. Even though if you eat lots of broccoli and spinach, I’d still, if you’re looking to heal the brain I would still use it as a supplement. \xa0 [16:05] David Tomen:\xa0Absolutely. 50 – 600 mg a day depending on what you’re trying to cure. \xa0 [16:13] Ashley James:\xa0Would you divide that up if someone decided to do the full dose like the full 600 mg a day? Would they divide that up? \xa0 [16:22] David Tomen:\xa0I would divide that up into three. For example, for diabetic neuropathy, it’s recommended to use 800 mg a day so you divide that into two doses. You’ll need 400 mg in the morning and 400 mg early afternoon. \xa0 [16:34] Ashley James:\xa0Is it best to take on an empty stomach or with food? \xa0 [16:37]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0This one on an empty stomach but it’s like it doesn’t really matter with lipoic acid because it’s both water and fat-soluble. I did make some notes when I was researching this that eating it with amino decreases its bioavailability. So taking it on an empty stomach is better but it’s not going to kill you if you happen to make a mistake and you eat it right after a meal. \xa0 [17:11] Ashley James:\xa0The benefits of supplements is you’re not going to have these large reactions if you took a drug the wrong way. \xa0 [17:19] David Tomen:\xa0Yes. It’s just going to work better if you take it on an empty stomach. The thing about alpha lipoic acid supplements they contain a mixture of RLA and SLA. RLA is the natural kind of lipoic acid that’s found in our system. S lipoic acid is the synthetic kind. The thing is that R lipoic acid is pretty unstable. They combine it 50-50 with synthetic lipoic acid just to maintain it’s stability so that they could put in the capsule so you could take it as a supplement. \xa0 [18:03] Ashley James:\xa0Do you find that even though half of it is synthetic, people still gain benefit from taking it? \xa0 [18:09] David Tomen:\xa0 Absolutely. There are a couple of R Lipoic acid versions that have been produced that are patented that would improve the stability of that particular as RSLA is a little bit more expensive but it’s possible to get plain RLA. You’re just going to pay more for it. \xa0 [18:26] Ashley James:\xa0I know one from Japan that was they claim it to be all-natural and stable. \xa0 [18:43]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0 Yes. That’s the one that they used in Performance Lab Energy’s got that and that’s the one that I use. Anyway, that is lipoic acid. Another one that you can do is CoQ10. This is a natural\xa0antioxidant\xa0synthesized in every single cell in your body and brain and it helps produce\xa0adenosine triphosphate\xa0which is your mitochondria source of energy. There’s two types of CoQ10. There’s one ubiquinone. It gets converted to ubiquinol your cells and then once ubiquinol gets converted back to ubiquinone. We find that people that are over 40, there’s some research that shows that if you supplement with ubiquinol you get more benefit. Then some other people say ubiquinone is better for them. They get as much benefit from ubiquinone as they do from ubiquinol. One is more expensive than the other. \xa0 [19:41]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0I know that you have some supplements brands that you specifically recommend. We’ll make sure that we include that in the information on the show notes because after we had you on the first time, several listeners have reached out to me and said, “What brand do I get? David didn’t tell us what brand.” I know you’ve looked into the quality and the – \xa0 [20:11] David Tomen:\xa0 I look deeply into the quality. \xa0 [20:11]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Yes and I really want to make sure that we protect the listener that they make sure that they have access to the best quality. \xa0 [20:20] David Tomen:\xa0Okay. I know that alpha lipoic acid, the R lipoic acid that we’re talking about and Coenzyme Q10 are both available in Performance Lab Energy which is the one that I use. \xa0 [20:30] Ashley James:\xa0 Okay. Great. \xa0 [20:32] David Tomen:\xa0Creatine. Creatine is a non-essential amino acid that synthesized in your liver and your brain uses it to recharge adenosine triphosphate that fuels mitochondria. ATP is directly involved in producing packaging and secreting neurotransmitters, which obviously affects intelligence, improves memory, faster thinking, improves mood. Creatine fuels ATP, which boosts cellular metabolism. This is another way that you can energize your cells. Another natural one is Gingko Biloba. Gingko is one of the oldest species of trees on earth. Gingko increases nitric oxide levels, which dilate blood vessels which increases cerebral circulation which improves oxygen and glucose availability to neurons which improve memory recall, cognition, and learning. There was one interesting study with 31 stroke patients that look at the effects of gingko in stroke recovery. The patients were given with 1,500 mg of gingko per day and the researchers found that the stroke patients using gingko had lower oxidative stress, inflammation, and better anti-oxidant levels. Along with the greater decrease in C-reactive proteins and an increase in circulating antioxidants. \xa0 [22:05] Ashely James:\xa0I love it. This is where it’s buyer beware. There was a group decided to test how much gingko Biloba was on the shelf at Walmart or Target or whatever pharmacy you could just buy capsules of Gingko Biloba and they discovered that many of the over the counter gingko Biloba supplements contain 100% filler and zero gingko Biloba. \xa0 [22:37] David Tomen:\xa0That happened in New York. That was when New York attorney general sued and went after Target, CBS, Walmart, and Walgreens I think and a couple of other big retailers that are white labeling these supplements and that’s what exactly what happened. I actually spent quite a bit of time and I wrote a couple of posts on this on how to choose the best supplement. We can do a whole podcast on just this but generally what you’re looking for is stay away from department store brands and drugstore brands of supplements because they sell drugs. That’s not their business. Look for a company that that’s all they do is produces and sells supplements. The Vitamin Shoppe is a good example although they were guilty of putting out some crap in years past but have lightly changed the way they’re doing things and they test everything now but other big brands like Now foods, Doctor’s Best, Nature’s Way. These companies all test their stuff before it goes into production, during production then after encapsulation before they ship it and will actually send you a certificate of analysis proving that what’s in that batch of capsules is actually in there on request. They usually indicate this to their website. A company like the Bulk Supplements for example. I believe you can pull download a certificate of analysis right from their website.\xa0 A couple of companies do that but most of them you have to ask for it. \xa0 [24:31] Ashely James:\xa0Got it. I love it. \xa0 [24:34] David Tomen:\xa0Gingko, 40 mg three times a day. \xa0 [24:37] Ashely James:\xa0How much Creatine should we take? \xa0 [24:40] David Tomen:\xa0Creatine is kind of like up in the air grams. Creatine is a funny one because it’s sold as to the athletic world. There’s a bunch of different kinds of Creatine and from my research what I found is just that Creatine modified by a reputable supplement manufacturer works just as well as the other fancy ones. Up to five grams a day. \xa0 [25:19] Ashely James:\xa0Is that on empty stomach? \xa0 [25:22] David Tomen:\xa0Creatine probably better on an empty stomach otherwise it’s going to compete with stuff that’s going on because when you eat protein, for example, you’ve got transporters in your gut that help transport it to place in your body like your brain. When you take a supplement that is competing for the same transports one is going to win over the other one. Right? So it may work, it may not. It’s kind of like you’re not sure who’s going to win. Some things better to take on an empty stomach so it’s not competing with anything else. \xa0 [26:02] Ashely James:\xa0The CoQ10, I find it fascinating that those who are on Statin drugs need to take CoQ10 because statin drugs inhibit the body’s ability to produce CoQ10. We need CoQ10 for the heart to beat. It’s very, very important. Those on statin drugs will feel fatigued and exhausted as one of the side effects because the statin drugs are inhibiting the body’s ability to produce CoQ10 so their bodies just ran out of fuel so they have to supplement. But they’re told to supplement a very small amount. How much CoQ10 is optimal to take daily? \xa0 [26:41] David Tomen:\xa02 – 400 mg. \xa0 [26:44] Ashely James:\xa0Would you say that would be on empty stomach or with food? \xa0 [26:51] David Tomen:\xa0I’m not so sure that it makes a difference with CoQ10. \xa0 [26:56] Ashely James:\xa0There’s one thing about CoQ10 is we can take too much. Back when we lived in Las Vegas, I was supplementing with CoQ10 and a few other things. My husband had to go to work at 4 in the morning. I’d wake up and make him lunch and see him off. Sometimes I’d go back to bed. Sometimes I’d stay up. I woke up, I made him his lunch. I took my supplements, my 400 mg of CoQ10 and then I fell asleep on the couch. Woke up again, forgot I took my supplements, took another 400mg and I might have done it again later in the day forgetting I had taken my supplements but I ended up having a negative reaction. I thought I was going to die. My heart was just beating like crazy. No matter how much I breathe, I couldn’t get oxygen into my lungs. I felt like I was drowning. And I was lying there in the couch going, “That’s it. My husband’s going to come home and he’s going to find his wife dead.” Later upon looking this up and talking to a naturopath, I discovered that you can take if you take too much CoQ10 it can cause an adrenal dump. I was experiencing basically my adrenal is completely dumping and me going through that stress response not knowing what I was stressed about lying on the couch thinking I was going to die. It’s not lethal but it can be very uncomfortable to take too much CoQ10 which you have to really, really overdose but if you stay under the 400 mg a day you’re not going to experience what I experienced. \xa0 [28:46] David Tomen:\xa0I’ve got even more specific dosage recommendations than that on my CoQ10 dosage notes on the Nootropics Expert. For example, if you’re using it as an anti-oxidant, 60 – 150 mg per day, for muscle control problems 300 – 3,000 mg. For Alzheimer’s disease 400 mg. For heart attack recovery, 30 – 600 mg. Even I’ve got other ones too, male infertility and Peyronie’s disease, 30 – 300 mg. Diabetic nerve pain, 400 mg. Weight loss, 100 mg. The dosage recommendations were pretty specific on what you’re trying to do. If you’re just using it if you’re a reasonably healthy person and you just want to use it as help boost your anti-oxidant defenses 60 – 150 mg. \xa0 \xa0 [29:40] Ashley James:\xa0Got it. Awesome. We’ve got the Alpha lipoic acid, the CoQ10, Creatine, Gingko Biloba. What’s next? \xa0 [29:51] David Tomen:\xa0N-acetyl L-Cysteine. This is naturally occurring amino acid. Well, it’s L-cysteine. There’s just an acetyl group added to it to increase its bioavailability and it works primarily by restoring glutathione. \xa0 [30:11] Ashley James:\xa0I’ve got some right here. NAC right? \xa0 [30:16] David Tomen:\xa0Yup. NAC. I think NAC is an amazing supplement because it not only does it helps glutathione I find that when I’m using NAC, when everybody else around me has got the flu or a cold, I don’t get it but it also helps restore dopamine receptors which is really important for me being adult ADD and using Ritalin. Right? 600 mg three times a day. \xa0 [30:43]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0 Oh, man. I’m taking 500 mg twice a day so you’re saying 600 mg three times a day? \xa0 [30:51] David Tomen:\xa0 500 mg twice a day is good. But you can take another one. \xa0 [30:58] Ashley James:\xa0 Did you say 600 three times a day? \xa0 [31:00] David Tomen:\xa0Yes. \xa0 [31:01] Ashley James:\xa0Okay, three times a day. What introduced me to NAC, my son before we figured out why he was having this constant runny nose, stuffy nose then occasional asthma and he’s so healthy, eats so clean, “What’s going on?” and we finally found our naturopathic pediatrician that he has allergies. To dust mites then he has about seven food allergies just odd foods like garlic which is in everything. It’s really hard to avoid garlic obviously he does a lot of meals at home of garlic, oats, dairy, and fish. Just pretty much all the fish he’s allergic to. If he’s exposed to garlic for example. He’ll have stuffy nose. If it’s garlic and then he goes and plays at a friend’s house and he’s exposed to more dust mites, it’s kind of a one-two punch his histamine goes through the roof and he can get into a bit of asthma or his nose becomes completely clogged and so our naturopath said for him to take NAC every day. That NAC in large doses causes mucus to become more fluid and so if you have a stuffy nose, then by taking it, it’ll drain the nose. At one point I had a head cold and I just took NAC all day long. I couldn’t believe it. It was so wonderful. It just drained the area and also the added benefit that it’s a wonderful support for our anti-oxidant system in the body. I have seen positive results from this supplement. \xa0 [32:43] David Tomen:\xa0It’s one of my favorite supplements. Anti-inflammatory as a free radical scavenger. It’s just NAC is good stuff. Get some. \xa0 [32:56]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0On your website, do you sell it? Do you have links to your favorite brand? \xa0 [33:03] David Tomen:\xa0For some, I started to do that. I don’t think that I did it for NAC. I use Doctor’s Best. \xa0 [33:15] Ashley James:\xa0 Okay, great. I just buy it straight from my naturopath. They branded themselves so I don’t know who makes it but I trust my naturopath but Doctor’s Best is a good brand. \xa0 [33:30] David Tomen:\xa0You’ll know that if it’s working if you’re getting results from it you know that it’s a good supplement. \xa0 [33:34] Ashley James:\xa0Yes, we’re getting results so I’m happy with it. If you don’t get any results from NAC then change brands. \xa0 [33:41] David Tomen:\xa0Exactly. [Laughter] \xa0 [33:34] Ashley James:\xa0Awesome. \xa0 [33:46] David Tomen:\xa0The next thing that we should talk about is synapses and brain aging. \xa0 [33:51] Ashley James:\xa0 Before we do, can you explain for those who don’t know the synapses? Can you give people the basic understating of why the synapses is important? [34:03] David Tomen:\xa0I call it an empty space but it’s not really an empty space between neurons. When neurons fire they send electrical signals across the synaptic cleft to the neuron next door. It’s like the joint between neurons. The communication junction between neurons. [34:28] Ashley James:\xa0 It’s like the cell tower between the two cellphones. \xa0 [34:32] David Tomen:\xa0Kind of like that, yes. Synapses they wear out. For example, when they did autopsies on Alzheimer’s patients, they found that there was a profound decrease in synapse numbers in brain regions involving learning and memory. Same thing with Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease.\xa0 The reduction of number of synapses in your brain could be part of the cause for brain shrinkage as we get older as well. Now you seen these stories of how your brain shrinks as you get older. One of the reasons is you’re losing synapses. Our brain loses 5% of its weight per decade after the age 40, part of that is synapse loss. When you start losing synapses of they’re break and they don’t work, your brain signaling starts breaking down. That’s how our brain works. It’s by signaling between neurons and when it can’t signal anymore, you’re in big trouble. We know that we can increase the number of synapses it’s called synaptogenesis. The growth of new synapses by increasing brain-derived nootropic factor. I wrote a separate post on 13 different nootropics that I identified to boost BDNF or Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor. One neuroscientist called it miracle growth for the brain. \xa0 [36:15] Ashley James:\xa0[Laughter] Sign me up. \xa0 [36:19] David Tomen:\xa0Right? You can boost BDNF with Ashwagandha. Ashwagandha is been used before thousands of years but recent researches have shown that Ashwagandha helps regenerate axons and dendrites in synapses. \xa0 [36:39] Ashley James:\xa0Fascinating. I love Ashwagandha because it is so nice and tonifying for the adrenals. I know it from that angle. You know, from the brain angle. \xa0 [36:51] David Tomen:\xa0\xa0It’s a very, very powerful supplement. \xa0 [36:54] Ashley James:\xa0Would you recommend it someone just to drink it as a tea all day long? Take it in a capsule form? How much Ashwagandha would be beneficial? \xa0 [37:05] David Tomen:\xa0250 – 500 mg a day. Probably the easiest way to make sure that you’re getting the exact doses by taking capsules. But again, there is usually it’s typically Ashwagandha extract and the ayurvedic pharmacopeia of India recommends 3 – 6 g daily of standard ground Ashwagandha powder but we typically buy an extract that’s 45% with anilides. If it’s 45% with anilides, it depends what we want to do. For arthritis, 250 – 500 mg. For antioxidant production, 100 mg. For immunity, 100 – 200 mg. For sexual performance, 250 – 500 mg. It depends on what you want to use it for. If you’re going to take 500 mg you divide the dose up to 250 mg in the morning and then 250 mg in early afternoon. \xa0 [38:11] Ashley James:\xa0Is this something you take with food or without food? \xa0 [38:13] David Tomen:\xa0\xa0It doesn’t matter with Ashwagandha. \xa0 [38:17] Ashley James:\xa0So you can’t take it with your food? \xa0 [38:21]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0\xa0You can take it with your food. It’s better to find an extract from a reputable company because you know what’s on the labels is actually what’s on the capsule and preferably there’s no other ingredient listed on the label either and certified organic is even better. \xa0 [38:41] Ashley James:\xa0Right. Especially if it’s an extract since it’s like a concentrate you don’t want concentrated pesticides in your supplement. \xa0 [38:49] David Tomen:\xa0Or heavy metals or herbicides. Ashwagandha is good for restoring synapses. Artichoke extract is a natural PDE4 inhibitor that supports the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate or cAMP. cAMP helps stimulate the productions of CREB which stands for cAMP response element-binding protein. That CREB is a protein that’s needed for new neuron and synapse growth. I know that sounds a little complicated. \xa0 [39:29] Ashley James: No, like it. It sounds delicious. I love artichoke. Could I just eat artichokes all day or is this really strong concentrate? \xa0 [39:38] David Tomen:\xa0Artichoke extract is preferable. Artichoke extract because it increases CREB. It also enhances long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation is what’s behind the encoding of long term memory. Recommended dosage is 400 mg a day, I’m sorry 900 mg a day. \xa0 [40:06] Ashley James:\xa0Do we divide that up? Or just? \xa0 [40:08]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Preferably, yes. Most of these supplements, when you get into higher dosages like that it’s preferable to divide them up into two or three. Which is generally easy to do because you can get artichoke extract for example 300 mg taken three times a day. \xa0 [40:25] Ashley James:\xa0Right. I’ve never heard of artichoke extract. I’ve never considered an artichoke as an herb or medicinal plant. So it’s very cool. \xa0 [40:36] David Tomen:\xa0It is. The next one is a very, very powerful supplement and that’s Berberine. Berberine increases glucagon-like peptide or GLP-1. This is peptide hormone plays a critical role in controlling diabetes but it’s also involved in cognition, learning, and neuroprotection. Studies have shown that when you enhance GLP-1, it enhances synaptic plasticity. It also reduces the aggregation of\xa0amyloid-β protein\xa0and\xa0Tau.\xa0Berberine can help prevent Alzheimer’s. I actually use it for insulin resistance. \xa0 [41:27] Ashley James:\xa0How much Berberine is good to take and can we take it with food or without food? \xa0 [41:33] David Tomen:\xa0You can take it with food. How much do I take? I’m trying to remember what’s on the bottle. The recommended dose is between 900 – 1,500 mg a day. I think I might use 500 mg. I’m taking that three times a day. I found that once I started taking it when I got my labs back, they were normal. \xa0 [41:57] Ashley James:\xa0 Nice. You mentioned diabetes and I think that’s really important to touch on is that there seemed that even if you don’t diabetes, you have just pre-diabetes or your blood sugar is not optimal. Even just having not optimal blood sugars, so your blood sugars high sometimes but not enough to consider diabetes, even that is enough to do damage to the brain. They’re finding that they can do brain scans and see that your brain has significantly aged and lost vasculature significantly because of unregulated high blood sugar. It’s like when a disease is painful, like arthritis, it gets a softer buts to take action and do something about it but when it’s silent like high blood pressure or having unregulated blood sugar, sometimes we’re not aware of the symptoms, right? There’s no pain so we’re not motivated to do something about it. Here the motivator is if we don’t have really good blood sugar then it is destroying our brain and many other parts of our body that we don’t see but high blood sugar causes damage to the circulatory system across the board and inflammation, especially to the brain. They’re seeing that even just pre-diabetes is enough to do a lot of damage to the brain. People with full-blown diabetes especially if they’ve had periods of unregulated high blood sugar that the brain is very negatively affected and ages very quickly in that state. Berberine wonderful recommendation. \xa0 [44:05] David Tomen:\xa0One of the drugs that are the primary the most popular drug that most doctors prescribe for pre-diabetes is Metformin. Berberine in clinical trials has been found to be as good as Metformin for diabetes. \xa0 [44:27] Ashley James:\xa0They tried to put me on Metformin. I was type-2 diabetic and I reversed it with naturopathic medicine and that’s one of the reasons why I do this podcast. They tried to put me on metformin and it made me so sick. I’m so thankful that I experienced every single side effect that it has. One of my friends actually went on metformin and it caused her to be in and out of the hospital for a year with acute pancreatitis. She was only able to drink broth for an entire year and it made her so sick. It made me sick but I would not have to live in a hospital but I experienced all the symptoms and decided to get off of it and decided to look for the more natural route. A lot of times people are put on Metformin even preventively like, “You’re pre-diabetic. Let’s get you a Metformin now so we can prevent you from going further.” I love that you’re pointing out that Berberine can be more effective and also much less side effects. \xa0 [45:34] David Tomen:\xa0Far, far for your side effects. The only side effect that I came across was long-term use of Berberine can affect muscle protein synthesis and cause muscle atrophy. If you’re worried about muscle loss either don’t use Berberine or exercise a little bit. \xa0 [45:54] Ashley James:\xa0There you go, or use it short term. \xa0 [45:58] David Tomen:\xa0Use it short term but it is a very, very potent supplement. Moving on, Berberine, Forskolin. Forskolin is the only known nootropic supplement to naturally and directly boost\xa0cAMP which is Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate.\xa0 \xa0 [46:20]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Can you spell that? Forskolin? \xa0 [46:22] David Tomen:\xa0F-O-R-S-K-O-L-I-N. Forskolin. We already talked about this with artichoke extract. cAMP directly stimulates the production of\xa0CREB which is the\xa0protein needed for new neuron and synapse growth and CREB enhances\xa0long-term potentiation. Either from artichoke extract or forskolin. \xa0 [46:57]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0So they would do one or the other? \xa0 [47:00]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0One or the other. For Forskolin, 125 – 250 mg a day.\xa0 Another one that’s very effective for synapses is Vitamin B8, Inositol. Inositol which is naturally not really a vitamin they found out but Inositol acts as a\xa0“secondary messenger” that facilitates communication between brain cells.\xa0Lower than normal levels of Myo-inositol in middle-aged adults can signal the initial stages of cognitive decline such as Alzheimer’s and dementia.\xa0My wife uses inositol actually for lipido. Myo-inositol is pretty amazing supplements for whole bunch of different reasons but it will help you grow on your synapses. It helps boosts serotonin and dopamine in your brain, dopamine. And serotonin receptor sensitivity. It improves the effectiveness of serotonin glutamate and dopamine. Myo-inositol effects MRNA, which regulates cell volume. Phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways control signals inside and outside our brain cells. Inositol plays a role in DNA repair, long-term potentiation. It’s a component of brain cell membranes that regulates cell metabolism and cellular energy consumption. \xa0 [48:42]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Is this something that’s normally in just a multi B vitamin or should we take it separately? \xa0 [48:51] David Tomen:\xa0This one you need to take in separately because it’s not in most B supplements and you want to look specifically for Myo-inositol. It’s M-Y-O dash Inositol. \xa0 [49:07]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Is this something that we can take on an empty stomach or with food? \xa0 [49:12] David Tomen:\xa0You can take this on either one. Empty stomach or on food. This is a pretty amazing supplement actually. It’s one of those unsung supplements that most people don’t know about. It makes it easier for you to fall asleep but it doesn’t knock you out like sleep meds do. It increases serotonin, dopamine receptors densities so that you can think faster and your memory is better. \xa0 [49:42] Ashley James:\xa0Sign me up. \xa0 [49:44] David Tomen:\xa0Yes. Inositol is great for social occasions because anxiety levels decrease. Inositol outperformed Prozac at reducing panic attacks in one clinical study. \xa0 [49:59] Ashley James:\xa0Wow. \xa0 [50:00]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Wasn’t that amazing? \xa0 [50:01] Ashley James:\xa0It is amazing. Now, are there foods that we can increase to get this? \xa0 [50:08] David Tomen:\xa0 Not that on amounts that we need it. If we need it. \xa0 [50:17] Ashley James:\xa0We want the concentration if we want to prevent panic attacks for example? \xa0 [50:22] David Tomen:\xa0Yes. \xa0 [50:23] Ashley James:\xa0Right. \xa0 [50:24] David Tomen:\xa0If you want to avoid Prozac but you still need the help, try out Inositol. The nice thing about Inositol is that you can use it with an anti-depressant. A lot of supplements you can’t because you’ll get into big trouble but Myo-Inositol is not a problem. Actually it helps, it seems to improve, it helps make your anti-depressant meds work better. \xa0 [50:51] Ashley James:\xa0Now I know that you take on clients that you just coach people and a lot of people will come to you because they’re on anti-depressants or they’re are other ends and they want to take in supplements but they don’t know what’s going to negatively effects them. We talked about this a little bit in episode 362 that most doctors have no training around, I meant the doctors would prescribe you with an anti-depressant but they don’t really know about the supplements and the herbs and what would be good and not good to take. This is just not in the real house. Can a listener get an appointment with you if they are on medication and they want to know if these nootropics would be okay? Do you have that level of research under your belt? \xa0 [51:49]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Yes. I have been that. I have been doing consulting several times a week since I started about a year ago. It’s turning out to be pretty popular. If you’re using to this internationally, we’ll do it over Skype. If you’re in the United States or Canada we can do it over Skype or just over the phone but I do have power sessions or one hour sessions. Typically, the initial consultation is an hour because there’s so much to cover but if somebody’s dealing with depression for example and are on anti-depressants and want to get off or just want to start nootropics but don’t know where to start because it could be dangerous to combine some of this stuff, I’ll walk you through all that. \xa0 [52:30] Ashley James:\xa0Right because you’ve looked at all the studies so you’re basing it all on the science which I really appreciate. \xa0 [52:38]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Yes. You can get yourself into loads and loads of trouble using some of these supplements. \xa0 [52:43] Ashley James:\xa0Right. If you’re on medication. If a listener is is not on any medication, they’re free to take these supplements, you’ve given us the doses at very safe levels? \xa0 [52:55]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Yes. \xa0 [52:57] Ashley James:\xa0Excellent. I take it that none of these supplements would contradict the other ones. They will complement. \xa0 [53:06] David Tomen:\xa0You can take all of those at the same time for these particular thing for synapses then you’re fine. Included in this lesson, we still have more to go here so we’re going to have to move on but I also have to help synapse growth, magnesium,\xa0Pterostilbene,\xa0Uridine Monophosphate. Those all help restore synapse growth. The next thing I’d like to talk about Ashley is, Alzheimer’s and dementia and brain aging because it’s a growing problem. In the case of Alzheimer’s for example, they’re looking for drugs that inhibit amyloid b protein intel production. Nobody has been able to come up with the secret sauce yet with whatever drug that prevents Alzheimer’s but there are supplements you can take to help prevent it from happening. For example,\xa0Huperzine-A.\xa0Boosts neuron resistance to\xa0beta-amyloid–induced dysfunction that could lead to diseases like Alzheimer’s. Beta-amyloid affects\xa0ATP\xa0levels in\xa0mitochondria.\xa0Huperzine-A protects against this damage. Huperzine-A is 200 micrograms per day once every third day. You can’t use the supplements every day. Another great one for preventing B-Amyloid aggregation is Resveratrol because Resveratrol activates AMPK, which reduces levels of Amyloid-beta deposits in the cerebral cortex. It prevents\xa0β-amyloid\xa0aggregation by scavenging oxygen\xa0free radicals, which induces protective enzymes such as\xa0heme oxygenase. Which prevents the build-up of deposits causing Alzheimer’s. Resveratrol, depending on what you’re using it for 20 – 250 mg a day. Piracetam. We haven’t talked much about the Piracetams or the Racetams but Piracetam was the very first nootropic ever invented. It was invented back in 1962. I believe it was. It’s used as a prescription drug in many places around the world to treat things like brain aging, brain injuries, dementia and Alzheimer’s. Several studies show that Piracetam enhances ATP production. Mitochondria membranes and neuroid outgrow in neurons. One study the researches shows Piracetam is able to repair mitochondria in those with mild Alzheimer’s and return their cellular function back to normal. Which is a very big deal. Piracetam you have to know how to dose it. They don’t call it a dietary supplement in the United States but you can buy it as a supplement they call it a research compound. It’s not something that you can buy in like Amazon but there’s a few companies that sell it online like Nootropics Depot for example. Dosage is usually 4,000 mg a day divided into three doses but you have to take it with Alpha GPC or CBP choline because it boosts the use of acetylcholine in your brain and if you don’t take it with acetylcholine supplement, you’ll get a headache. \xa0 [56:51] Ashley James:\xa0Why don’t they just include it? \xa0 [56:57] David Tomen:\xa0That’s a very good question. [Laughter] I don’t know. \xa0 [57:00] Ashley James:\xa0They’re selling something that an uninformed person would get a headache every time they took the supplement. You think that they’d want to prevent that. \xa0 [57:08] David Tomen:\xa0The thing is that the uninformed person doesn’t buy something like Piracetam. Right? Because you have to search this out and find it. It’s actually called nootropil when it’s sold as a drug in some countries but here you just look for Piracetam. It was invented by Dr. Corneliu Giurgea. He was the one who coined the term nootropic in 1973. \xa0 [57:41] Ashley James:\xa0I’m going to put it out there. I think you should work with a really good company in private label supplement and just take all these wonderful nutrients and make some kind of multi-nootropic and you should sell that because I would buy that. \xa0 [58:02]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0You know it will probably be better to make individual stacks to treat depending on what you’re trying to treat. That’s a whole other conversation. Several people have suggested that I do it. It’s just starting a supplement company, it’s an undertaking. \xa0 [58:20] Ashley James:\xa0I bet. Yes. We’re all rooting for you. \xa0 [58:28]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Thank you. St. John’s Wort. Research shows that St. John’s Wort extract decreases oxidative stress. It prevents neurotoxicity. It controls inflammation. And maybe an effective treatment for oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. St John’s Wort is easy to get but you have to be very careful with St. John’s Wort because it’s not something you combine with SSRI or you can get yourself into a load of trouble. If you’re not taking any anti-depressants or anti-anxiety drugs, St. John’s Wort is a fantastic option. 900 – 1,800 mg a day. The research shows that it has effective for anxiety and depression as prescription drugs. But we have the side benefit that it could possibly prevent Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Turmeric. Curcumin, which is the most active compound in turmeric, may help macrophages clear the amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer’s disease. Curcumin is something that we can do an entire podcast on because it does so many different things but just to sum it up, studies show that curcumin binds to amyloid-beta proteins found in Alzheimer’s disease and\xa0blocks its self-assembly. Studies show that heavy metals can induce Amyloid-beta aggregation\xa0that is concentrated in Alzheimer’s disease. Curcumin, by interaction with heavy metals such as cadmium and lead, prevents the neurotoxicity caused by these metals. \xa0 [01:00:25] Ashley James:\xa0Really? Oh, that’s cool. Does it cross the blood-brain barrier? \xa0 [01:00:31] David Tomen:\xa0It does. It just needs a little help. They found that they could boost the bioavailability of curcumin or turmeric by 2,000% by using it with Piperine. \xa0 [01:00:45] Ashley James:\xa0Right. Adding the black pepper. That’s the only reason why I have black pepper at the house, it’s to boost my curry. [Laughter] \xa0 [01:00:58]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0I actually use Bioperine on it. I’ve got a separate Bioperine supplement that I use for certain supplements to boost their availability. Now, let’s talk about vascular dementia and cerebral circulation. Your chances of developing white matter lesions and strokes and dementia increases as you age. If your family has a history of these types of diseases, your chances are even higher for this happening. White matter lesions are damage to the white matter in your brain and the primary cause seems to be bad blood circulation. Blood vessel damages associated with high blood pressure and small vessel disease would put you at a greater risk for stroke and other problems. Dementia and vascular dementia seems to be related. Both types are associated with a host of brain problems including increased risk of Alzheimer’s, stroke, disorder of the blood-brain barrier and arterial sclerosis. Research shows that problems with cerebral blood follow and white matter lesions in other associated brain cellular changes begin in mid-life. So like around 40. It’s never too early to start using some of this stuff. How do we boost cerebral circulation? We can do that with cat’s claw. Cat’s claw is a South American vine. That’s a very potent anti-inflammatory, it’s antioxidant effects that support DNA repair, immune function and normal cell division. Cat’s Claw has been shown in clinical studies to protect the brain from damage from stroke. Recommended dosage of Cat’s Claw standardized extract is 250 – 350 mg a day. Forskolin, which we already talked about, also helps boost cerebral circulation. Gingko Biloba, which we already talked about, also increases cerebral blood flow because it increases nitric oxide.\xa0Oat straw\xa0increases blood flow through several different mechanisms of action. It contains the amino acid\xa0arginine, which\xa0synthesizes to create\xa0nitric oxide.\xa0Nitric oxide\xa0dilates blood vessels allowing blood to flow easier. There are also, they’re hard to pronounce but they’re certain bioactive compounds that are unique to oats that has been shown to enhance nitric oxide production in human smooth muscle cells. It suppresses the inflammatory cytokines that work in combination with increased nitric oxide, which increases blood flow.\xa0Recommended dosage for Oat Straw extract is 800 – 1,600 mg a day. Another good one that we haven’t talked about is Pine Bark Extract. Pine Bark Extract as a nootropic is used primarily to increase cerebral blood flow. It does it by increasing nitric oxide in your brain. Resveratrol. Did we talked about resveratrol, yes? \xa0 [01:04:28] Ashley James:\xa0You had mentioned it briefly. \xa0 [01:04:32]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Some speculate that resveratrol found in red wine accounts for the French paradox which you know how the French can dine on baguettes and cheese and pate and pastries and they still don’t put on weight and they live longer. They think it’s because part of the reason is that Resveratrol increases cerebral circulation. Recommended dosage is 20 – 250 mg a day. One of my favorite supplements is Vinpocetine, which they’re trying to make illegal in the United States. You can’t buy it on Amazon anymore. \xa0 [01:05:15]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Okay, explain what’s going on? What’s the controversy around it? \xa0 [01:05:19]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Because somebody claims that back in 1983, they put a patent on it, so they want to sell it as a drug. It’s actually sold as a drug in several countries around the world. It’s just that it’s available for the last three decades or so as a dietary supplement. You can still get it from Life Extension and Swanson still makes it and a couple of other supplement companies but Amazon refuses to sell it. \xa0 [01:05:47] Ashley James:\xa0What is it? \xa0 [01:05:48]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0It’s a semi-synthetic derivative of vincamine, an alkaloid derived from the lesser periwinkle plant. \xa0 [01:05:58] Ashley James:\xa0I remember you talking about this a little bit on our last interview. \xa0 [01:06:02]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Yes. It inhibits an enzyme called\xa0PDE1\xa0it also reduces calcium levels in brain cells. When both of these are elevated smooth muscle in blood vessels contract, narrowing the diameter of blood vessels. Vinpocetine helps turn this around. I can actually feel Vinpocetine when I use it and I miss it when I don’t have it. I feel better. You know what I did yesterday, I went to see the doctor and I have a little problem with my blood pressure. I need to keep it under control and I was afraid going to the doctor that I was going to be like 150 something over 80 something and she tested it, my blood pressure was 138/69, I think. \xa0 [01:06:57] Ashley James:\xa0Very cool. It’s the second number is more important. \xa0 [01:07:00]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Yes. You know how I did that? \xa0 [01:07:02] Ashley James:\xa0With the Vinpocetine? \xa0 [01:07:04]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Yes. Just before I went to the doctor. \xa0 [01:07:08] Ashley James:\xa0The first number which was definitely high but that could absolutely be just from the stress of being in the doctor’s office. \xa0 [01:07:16]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0They’ve actually shown that. That your blood pressure increases when you’re at the doctor’s office. Vinpocetine really works. I love it. All you need is 10 mg three times a day. 10 mg before you go to the doctor.\xa0Vitamin\xa0B3 or Niacin, which most people know about, helps increase nitric oxide and helps blood flow in your entire body and cerebral circulation. Niacin does a whole bunch of other stuff too but right now, we’re just talking about increasing cerebral circulation so niacin does that. Vitamin B6\xa0is needed to regulate\xa0homocysteine. High homocysteine levels are linked to inflammation that can lead to blood vessel damage and possible plaque buildup leading to heart attack or\xa0stroke.\xa0Vitamin B12\xa0or methylcobalamin\xa0is\xa0essential\xa0for the synthesis of DNA, RNA and neurotransmitters, the maintenance of\xa0myelin\xa0sheaths and red blood cell formation. You actually need vitamin B6\xa0and\xa0Vitamin B9\xa0(Folate)\xa0and\xa0Vitamin B12(methylcobalamin)\xa0to keep your homocysteine levels down. That’s my story on preventing Alzheimer’s. It’s not a sure thing but there are certain things that you can do to really increase your chances of it not happening. \xa0 [01:08:56]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0In terms of diet, what is a good diet for supporting brain health? \xa0 [01:09:04] David Tomen:\xa0I just did a video on that and I just published it this morning. In this video, there are 11 essential nutrients that we normally get from food and you need each one of these nutrients every single day for either two or three meals to maintain decent brain health and they include things like carbohydrates and potassium and sodium and check out that video on YouTube. I just published it. A normal brain-healthy diet is going to be healthy fats. You need carbohydrates but reducing the amount of or you want complex carbohydrates rather than simple carbohydrates. \xa0 [01:09:55]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0So don’t do flour-based foods. Eat the sweet potato. Don’t eat the bread. Don’t eat the pasta, go have some legumes. \xa0 [01:10:05] David Tomen:\xa0I actually stopped eating things like pasta and bread. I just feel better. A lot of things changed. Of course, fruits and vegetables.\xa0 \xa0 [01:10:18]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Excellent. So whole foods plant-based diet would definitely support brain health. \xa0 [01:10:22] David Tomen:\xa0And healthy fats. Like grass-fed red meat provides all kinds of vitamins and minerals that your body needs. The other thing that happens with aging is neurotransmitter starts to decline and this is the last we’re going to talk about when it comes to aging. Studies show that the\xa0dopamine\xa0and\xa0serotonin\xa0levels decline as we age.\xa0Dopamine\xa0levels begin to decline by around 10% per decade\xa0starting in your early 20’s. That leads to declines in cognitive and motor performance. In other words, you don’t think as fast as you once did and you don’t move as fast either because you got less dopamine.\xa0Serotonin\xa0and\xa0brain-derived neurotrophic factor\xa0also decline with age. The enzyme\xa0monoamine oxidase\xa0increases with age, which degrades serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. The more\xa0monoamine oxidase, the more\xa0increases, the more you experience the negative effects on memory, mood, and behavior. As a matter of fact\xa0Monoamine oxidase inhibitors\xa0have long been used to treat behavior disorders including depression. Now we have several natural nootropic options for increasing neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin and for reducing or inhibiting Monoamine oxidase.\xa0Aniracetam\xa0is a fat-soluble\xa0ampakine\xa0nootropic that is well known in the nootropics community, it’s one of my favorite nootropics. It’s a fantastic\xa0anxiolytic. \xa0 [01:12:10] Ashley James:\xa0What does that mean? \xa0 [01:12:11]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0It means it’s anti-anxiety. It helps reduce anxiety and depression and fear and increase sociability. Clinical studies show that Aniracetam affects dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin receptors in your brain. The\xa0recommended dosage is 1,500 mg per day. Taken in two 750 mg doses, which is what I do. You’ve got to take it with a healthy fat like coconut oil and you have to take it with a good choline supplement like\xa0Alpha GPC\xa0or\xa0CDP-Choline\xa0because it – \xa0 [01:12:49]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Why don’t they sell it in coconut oil with the choline? \xa0 [01:12:53]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Because the Racetams are still research compounds. They’re not really sold as dietary supplements so you’re kind of like on your own when you’re using more of these “experimental supplements”. \xa0 [01:13:13]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0What is it made from? \xa0 [01:13:16] David Tomen:\xa0Aniracetam is a derivative of Piracetam and Piracetam is a derivative of GABA. \xa0 [01:13:30]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0I know that there’s lots of GABA receptors in the brain but I don’t know much about it. Do you know how do they make the supplement? Is it synthetic or is it from – \xa0 [01:13:44]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA and that was first invented by Dr. Giurgea back in 1962 because he was looking for a drug to treat motion sickness. I think it was motion sickness in astronauts. But he found out that it worked better for improving cognitive performance. Since then there has been probably a dozen at least Racetams invented developed off the original Piracetam that are all built around this, it’s a chemical core so if you take a look at the chemical structure of these things and you compare them side by side there’s just one little branch that’s different from the next. It’s a cyclic derivative of GABA. Aniracetam is similar to Piracetam. They have found in there has been tons and tons of studies done. It was invented by Hoffmann-La Roche. I believe in Switzerland in 1978. And it’s sold as a prescription drug it’s called Ampamet, Draganon, Memodrin, Referan, Sarpul in Europe but you can buy it as a research compound here. You can actually buy Aniracetam on Amazon. \xa0 [01:15:25]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Just make sure you take it with coconut oil and choline. \xa0 [01:15:30]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Choline, yes because it releases 2 – 300% more acetylcholine in your brain. \xa0 [01:15:38]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0And you don’t want to end up with the headache? \xa0 [01:15:40]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Correct. You get a Racetam headache. DHEA which is also called the “youth hormone”. DHEA is the most abundant hormone\xa0precursor\xa0in your body and is the source of your sex hormones. DHEA levels start decline as you age\xa0starting at around your\xa025th\xa0birthday.\xa0This is for men and women it’s bigger problem for men than women but it’s still a problem. Higher levels of DHEA are directly related to optimal\xa0concentration,\xa0working memory, and\xa0executive function. And DHEA is a natural\xa0MAO inhibitor which improves mood and energy levels [01:16:26]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0How much is a good dose to take? \xa0 [01:16:27] David Tomen:\xa0 25 – 50 mg a day for anyone over 18. \xa0 [01:16:33]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0That’s the DHEA? \xa0 [01:16:35]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0 DHEA, yes. Now there’s controversy around this because this is a steroid hormone. See my full review in Nootropics Expert for DHEA but anybody over 18 can get away with 25 mg a day and stay out of trouble from my research. Mucuna Pruriens or L-DOPA is synthesized in your brain by the amino acid. Anyway, it makes dopamine in your brain. It’s the precursor to dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. It boosts growth hormone levels in your brain to increase the production of neurons and\xa0glia cells. L-DOPA also produces neuromelanin, which are similar to the melanin pigment in your skin. So you get a tan easier and in your brain they absorb toxic quinones, and chelate heavy metals like mercury and lead. \xa0 [01:17:43]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0What’s its name again? \xa0 [01:17:44] David Tomen:\xa0Mucuna Pruriens. \xa0 [01:17:47]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Can you spell that? \xa0 [01:17:48]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0 Yes. Mucuna is M-U-C-U-N-A new word P-R-U-R-I-E-N-S. Mucuna Pruriens is usually 98% extract. It is 250 – 500 mg a day. Very powerful to increase dopamine. \xa0 [01:18:11]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0It increases dopamine but it also helps you get a tan? \xa0 [01:18:16]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Yes. \xa0 [01:18:18]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0That is so cool. \xa0 [01:18:20] David Tomen:\xa0 They use synthetic L-DOPA to treat Parkinson’s disease. Some have found that you can naturally treat Parkinson’s using Mucuna Pruriens and not have that side effects you get from synthetic L-DOPA because synthetic L-DOPA causes problems in your periphery and all of your places other than where it’s supposed to be in your brain. You don’t have that problem with Mucun Pruriens. L-Theanine which we were talking about before we started doing this podcast. L-Theanine is an\xa0amino acid\xa0found in green tea. L-Theanine increases\xa0GABA,\xa0serotonin\xa0and\xa0dopamine\xa0levels in your brain. As well as increasing\xa0Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor\xa0and\xa0Nerve Growth Factor\xa0and L-Theanine is an antagonist of\xa0NMDA receptors,\xa0which can inhibit synaptic release of\xa0glutamate.\xa0Which protects your brain from over-stimulation caused by glutamate, and possible glutamate toxicity. Research has found that\xa0if L-Theanine ispresent in the body at the time stroke occurs, brain damage is significantly reduced.\xa0A study in China concluded there was a 40% decreased risk of stroke in those who drank green, black or jasmine teas. Isn’t that amazing? \xa0 [01:19:50]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Oh, my gosh. How much tea you just need to drink it every day or should someone take it as a supplement if they’re concerned they’re going to have a stroke? \xa0 [01:20:00] David Tomen:\xa0If you’re concerned for stroke, 2 – 4 mg twice a day as a supplement. \xa0 [01:20:07]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Because it’s an amino acid, you take it on an empty stomach? \xa0 [01:20:10] David Tomen:\xa0Yes, but I drink it as green tea so I drink it whether I’m eating a meal or not. It’s just I’m drinking green tea all the time. You can get pretty much as much L-Theanine as you need for a reasonable normal healthy person by drinking four or five cups of green tea per day. \xa0 [01:20:29]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Excellent and there’s no concerns about how much caffeine that is in the green tea of you’re drinking five cups a day? \xa0 [01:20:38] David Tomen:\xa0It depends on the green tea. Usually the caffeine amount is listed on the label so check the label but it’s by a third of the caffeine that you normally get from coffee. \xa0 [01:20:57]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Is there more L-Theanine in green tea that is like the new leaf versus the oolong which comes from the branches, right? There’s this idea that drinking the newer buds versus drinking a tea that’s made more from a plant has been around longer has different compounds in it. Does that matter? \xa0 [01:21:27] David Tomen:\xa0It’s more about how it is steeped. \xa0 [01:21:30]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0How do we steep it? \xa0 [01:21:33]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0I actually wrote about this. Research at the University of New Castle in Australia set out to determine the optimal conditions for water extraction of healthy from green tea and they examined four different extraction methods and they learned that temperature, extraction time and ratio of water to tea and tea particles size had impacts on the extraction yield of L-Theanine from green tea. They concluded that the optimal conditions for extracting L-Theanine from green tea using water were found to be, are you ready for this? Extraction at 80°C for 30 minutes with the water to tea ratio of 20 to 1 milliliters per gram and a tea particle size of .5 to 1 milliliters. \xa0 [01:22:27]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Okay, you’ve lost me at the water. [Laughter] 20 mg, so that’s 20 to 1 ratio of how much water? \xa0 [01:22:39] David Tomen:\xa0The water to tea ratio used to be 20 – 1 milliliters to grams. \xa0 [01:22:45] Ashley James:\xa0So milliliters to grams. Got it. \xa0 [01:22:48] David Tomen:\xa0 And the tea particle size a half to one millimeter. \xa0 [01:22:54] Ashley James:\xa0Okay. I’ve been grinding my tea in a spice grinder thinking that more surface area means more flavor I guess. \xa0 [01:23:03] David Tomen:\xa0That’s not what these guys found. \xa0 [01:23:08] Ashley James:\xa0Wonderful. So steep it and do keep it at 80°c for 30 minutes or you just bring it to 8°c and leave it for 30 minutes? \xa0 [01:23:18] David Tomen:\xa0 I’m thinking just bring it to 80°c then leave it for 30 minutes. \xa0 [01:23:23] Ashley James:\xa0Unless you’re cooking it. Cooking your tea. Like if you go to traditional Chinese medicine practitioner they will give you some stinky herbs to take home and cook on the stove. \xa0 [01:23:35] David Tomen:\xa0That’s water extraction. If you buy it as a supplement there is a patented version called Suntheanine. It’s L-Theanine extraction from green tea called Suntheanine so look for that. \xa0 [01:23:55] Ashley James:\xa0Right. Or you could just have fun drinking the green tea. \xa0 [01:23:57] David Tomen:\xa0Or you could just have fun drinking green tea because there’s so many different teas. You go to Wholefood’s and you look at the shelf of green teas. There’s just row after row after row to experiment. There’s got to be one in there some place that you like. If you’ve never drank tea before you don’t really care for tea there’s got to be one in there that you’ll like. \xa0 [01:24:19] Ashley James:\xa0So the supplement company that I buy all my supplements from sells a green tea blend and I’m in love with it. It tastes so good. I’ve actually got my husband loving it which is like a miracle because he does not like tea and this morning he goes, “Did you make me cup?” so he loves it. I discovered that he’s been brewing it on his own. I’m the only one who does anything in the kitchen. He’s been brewing it on his own. This is how much he likes it. I’m very happy that I found a great green tea blend. Now you give me the formula for proper L-Theanine extraction. \xa0 [01:25:02] David Tomen:\xa0My favorite is Tazo organic chai. \xa0 [01:25:34] Ashley James:\xa0You told me that right before we started and I’m going to have to get some the next time at Wholefoods. Yes, do you do anything to it or you just put it on hot water? \xa0 [01:25:16]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Just put it on hot water. I got myself and went to Walmart. 20 bucks got this glass kettle so I can boil water in about 2 minutes and I can make it really fast and put a little bit of honey in it. It’s amazing. Anyway moving on here, we’re talking about increasing neurotransmitters. If you don’t want to use Mucuna Pruriens to increase dopamine. You can use\xa0N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine\xa0or L-Tyrosine because\xa0the dopamine pathway goes like this. It’s\xa0Phenylalanine to L-Tyrosine to L-DOPA to dopamine to\xa0norepinephrine to epinephrine. You can do it. You typically start with L-Tyrosine. L-Tyrosine is a gentler way to boost dopamine that Mucuna Pruriens that is a more direct way. N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is just L-Tyrosine with an acetyl group added to it, which was supposed to increase the bioavailability because L-Tyrosine is amino acid. Some people find that L-Tyrosine works better for them and some find that N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine works better for them. There was actually one clinical study that showed that N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is mostly excreted in your urine rather than getting used. I don’t find that’s the case with this body but it could be true for you. You would have to find out. If you want to try L-Tyrosine, it pays to experiment with both of those one at a time and see which one works best for you. \xa0 [01:26:57] Ashley James:\xa0How would you know if it’s working? \xa0 [01:27:00] David Tomen:\xa0Your mood changes, you’re thinking faster, and your focus is better. Your concentration is better. Because L-Tyrosine directly affects executive function which is the decision making part of your brain. \xa0 [01:27:17] Ashley James:\xa0Oh, I’ve got to give some to my son. 4-year-old’s mind. \xa0 [01:27:21] David Tomen:\xa0That one I’m not so sure because it also boosts libido. Libido, memory, focus, concentration, mood, and improves executive function, all of these things are influenced by L-tyrosine. Recommended nootropic dosage for N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is 350 – 500 mg twice per day. I actually use 700 mg. 750 mg three times a day for managing adult ADD. It depends on if you use too much and you boost dopamine too much because it turns into norepinephrine and then epinephrine which is your fight or flight hormone. You can get irritable and jittery, that’s when you know you’ve got too much. Now we also talked about\xa0monoamine oxidase, which increases as you age. It suppresses dopamine levels in your brain so you’ve got a double whammy over here as you age. Your dopamine levels are increasing and\xa0monoamine oxidase\xa0is increasing which is further forcing down dopamine and serotonin. What we would want is we want an inhibitor of\xa0monoamine oxidase.\xa0Oat Straw is that inhibitor. There also a couple of other ones but Oat Straw works really well. So it inhibits\xa0monoamine oxidaseB which increases dopamine levels. One of the problems was\xa0monoamine oxidaseinhibitors is that if you inhibit both A and B you have the cheese effect. The cheese effect is if you take a\xa0monoamine oxidase\xa0that inhibits both A and B and you eat cheese, you have a severe reaction. But if you only inhibit B like with Oat Straw you don’t have a problem. \xa0 [01:29:23] Ashley James:\xa0Or just don’t eat cheese. \xa0 [01:29:26]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0Don’t eat cheese or anything with cheese like pasta has got a little bit of cheese on it. Anything with cheese is going to cause a problem. Oat straw extract suppresses inflammatory\xa0cytokines\xa0by inhibiting\xa0nuclear factor κB\xa0activation.These Cytokines\xa0are implicated in a number of brain disorders including major depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s Disease. Recommended dosage for Oat Straw extract is 800 – 1,600 mg a day. The final one that you really should be supplementing with this if they’re over 20, is a B complex vitamin because well, the B vitamins are arguably the most important anti-aging nootropic supplements that we’ve got available.\xa0Vitamin B1\xa0is involved in the\xa0citric acid\xa0cycle\xa0that is used to produced\xa0adenosine triphosphate\xa0energy for your\xa0mitochondria.\xa0Vitamin B3\xa0is a precursor to NAD and\xa0NADH\xa0which provides electrons for\xa0ATP\xa0synthesis to power your\xa0mitochondria. Niacin enhances\xa0BDNF\xa0which is involved in\xa0synaptic plasticity\xa0and\xa0axon\xa0growth for memory and overall brain health. And it stimulates the production of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin.\xa0Vitamin B5\xa0or Pantothenic Acid\xa0is essential for the synthesis of acetylcholine, epinephrine, and serotonin. And is at the very heart of the\xa0citric acid cycle\xa0and electron transport chain which converts nutrients from food into energy which is used to make\xa0adenosine triphosphate\xa0for\xa0mitochondria.\xa0Vitamin B6\xa0or Pyridoxine\xa0is a\xa0required for\xa0coenzyme\xa0for the synthesis of dopamine, epinephrine, GABA,\xa0melatonin, norepinephrine, and serotonin. In fact, more than 140 distinct enzyme activities in your brain and your body depend on the P-5-P version of Vitamin B6.\xa0Vitamin B9\xa0or folate is involved in gene expression, amino acid synthesis,\xa0myelin\xa0synthesis, and is required for the synthesis of dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine and serotonin.\xa0Vitamin B12\xa0(methylcobalamin)\xa0is essential for the synthesis of\xa0DNA, RNA and neurotransmitters all of them and the maintenance of myelin sheaths protecting neurons, and red blood cell formation. And vitamin B12 is also needed to regulate\xa0homocysteine.\xa0High homocysteine levels are linked to inflammation that leads to blood vessel damage and possible plaque buildup leading to heart attack or stroke. That’s why you need a good B complex. \xa0 [01:32:37] Ashley James:\xa0I totally agree with you. One of the naturopaths that trained me had a patient that the family was in the process of moving that patient into a senior care facility. They had dementia. The naturopath said, “Let’s get them on a B vitamin supplement.” because B12 deficiency can cause dementia. I think they did B12 injections at this point but totally bounced back from the dementia. The dementia was not permanent. It wasn’t chronic. It was a symptom of nutrient deficiency. Another naturopath I studied with, he mapped out 900 different diseases that cross species line all are linked to deficiencies of 90 different nutrients. 60 minerals, 12 amino acids, all the vitamins and the fatty acids that each one just missing. If you miss copper if you have too little copper. One of the diseases that people can develop is or it’s not a disease it a fatal condition if you don’t catch it in time, hernia, chronic hernia. How you know you have copper deficiency? The symptoms of it are premature gray hair because copper is also needed in the production of the pigment. It can also cause pigment lost in the skin. People who are darker skin who start t have white patches like Michael Jackson had. That is a copper deficiency. Very classic signs of it but you can also have premature wrinkles and you can have problems with the vasculature like in your legs like the veins started popping out and having pain in the veins. All of that are early warning sign of copper deficiency. Copper being something you don’t want to have too much of but if you have too little of it’s one of those nutrient the body need to produce the building blocks to keep everything together basically. It’s part of the building blocks to build the strong vasculature and it becomes weaker without it and then we eventually develop aneurysm as a result. It’s just one of those nutrients that he mapped out. He sees that we can prevent all disease. All disease with nutrients and of course, diet because diet can cause tremendous stress on our body if it’s the wrong diet. He likes to point out that if we look at the diseases and the longevity of those in the United States that if its out of the certain line, I think it’s the Mason Dickson line? Is that what it’s called? Basically in the south where fried food is should be one of the amendments according to them, they’d fry water if they could but fried food is so much more prevalent in the diet and people die 10 years earlier that those in the north or in the Pacific North West where we eat less fried food. So they see the oxidative damage by eating fried food. Even once a week is enough to harm the brain, to harm the vasculature, to take 10 years off of our life and to decrease eye sight. It goes on and on. But diet is incredibly important. So avoiding oxidative stress but also making sure the we have these 90 essential nutrients in our food and also in our supplements because it’s very hard to secure minerals now. The 60 minerals very hard to secure. I would say in addition to, you’re saying take a good multi B vitamin and I say that’s absolutely true and I would add that take a really good multi-mineral and trace mineral supplement because even if you eat lots and lots of greens, it’s very hard to secure enough minerals these days because of the farming practices. Even organic farms, it’s just difficult because they don’t re-mineralize the soil which is something they used to do and they don’t do it anymore. \xa0 [01:37:20]\xa0David Tomen:\xa0I think Ashley that there would be a lot less disease if people just took a really high quality multivitamin which typically has higher dosages than with the RDA is. They’re in a form that your body can use and not synthetic. That’s the reason why I use the Performance Lab Multi because it’s all natural, it’s grown from yeast and there’s nothing else in it. Just vitamins and minerals. And a really high quality B complex vitamin. You would see a lot of fewer cases of dementia, alzehimers, Parkinson’s, depression and anxiety and I could just go on and on and on and that is just the brain. The things is that most of the nootropics reviewed on the Nootropics Expert can be considered anti-aging supplements. You know we’ve got tons and tons of research showing that taking the right nootropic supplement can optimize your brains health and protect you from cognitive decline well into the future. Dozens and dozens of nootropic supplements to choose from. You know we’ve got amino acids and herbs, minerals and vitamins and even the Racetam family that we’re taking about. The prime mutations and combinations that enough to perfect your anti-aging nootropics stack can your brain which is kind of counter to what we’re trying to achieve right? So here’s a suggestion, choose one or two from each of the categories that we talked about in this podcast. If I can listen to the podcast again and just pick one or two supplements from each one of these categories. Go to Nootropics Expert and carefully review the full article that I’ve written to make sure that you understand what exactly the nootropic does and how it can interact with any of your prescription meds so that you can understand the possible side effects. Choose the lowest suggested dosage per each one that you choose, and start using it. \xa0 [01:39:35]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0And when would they increase the dose? \xa0 [01:39:39] David Tomen:\xa0 Possibly never. Possibly, if there’s a recommended dose for just at random, a 500 – 1000 mg, so you start out with 500 mg to see how you react to it. If you feel absolutely nothing or there is no negative reaction that you might want to quick up the dose to 750 mg and see how you feel but never ever go past the maximum recommended dosage. \xa0 [01:40:13]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Right. Yes, because we do have that feeling in the United Sates, I don’t know if it’s just a value or a personal philosophy but if a little bit is good then a lot is even better and we get into some trouble that way. Right? \xa0 [01:40:32] David Tomen:\xa0Yes, that’s absolutely the wrong thing to do. You don’t want to do that especially with stuff that’s affecting your brain. \xa0 [01:40:39]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Just like you could eat too much celery you could kill yourself with water, you could kill yourself with healthy things. We just wanted the safe effective doses. You want people to start feeling the difference. They should feel that their moods improve, even their sleep is better. Maybe their sex drives improved, that they’re thinking clear, that they’re thinking faster. They’re going to see noticeable differences that even maybe people around them notice. It’s going to take a few months but then people will start to notice a difference in them as well after starting on a good regimen. I like that your advice of taking two from each section and just reading on your website the information and get really clear on the protocol that they’re designing or if they get confused they could reach out to you. They could book an appointment and see that you could help them to formulate their protocol. \xa0 [01:41:46] David Tomen:\xa0And if you don’t like using the internet, at least use the internet to go to Nootropics Expert and buy my book. It’s called Head First. It’s almost 600 pages, it’s a manual for fixing your brain. You can use the book or you can use the website or you can book a consultation with me or you can go to YouTube and watch anyone of the almost a hundred videos I’ve got now on the YouTube channel. There are all kinds of ways to get help for your brain. \xa0 [01:42:14]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Very cool. Before we wrap up today’s interview, I’d love to hear since you’ve been working with people, you must’ve had some feedback. Can you share some stories of success? Last time we had you, you shared your story, which was incredible I definitely recommend listeners go back and check out episode 362 with David Tomen. Hearing his story because it’s a great one. I’d love to hear, do you have any stories of success that you’d like to share with us today? \xa0 [01:42:45] David Tomen:\xa0You know there’s almost a hundred thousand people a month going through Nootropics Expert now. Where I get, the comments are coming in more and more often now. Either people will say, “I was able to manage ADHD or ADD or I was able to get off anti-depressant medication or anti-anxiety medication or I was able to get up in front of a group of people and do a presentation without panicking.” There’s just little stories like that that keep on coming out in the comments section. \xa0 [01:43:27] Ashley James:\xa0These are comments are the bottom. You have blog basically. All your articles are blog posts and at the bottom people can leave their comments. I’ve read them, they’re great. They were asking questions, you reply. So you’re saying that listeners can go there scroll down at the bottom of the article and read the comments. \xa0 [01:43:51] David Tomen:\xa0Yes and see what other people are saying, people are sharing they’ll leave a comment saying, “This is my stack now based on the stuff that you’ve suggested.” One of the most hardening things that I’m seeing now is people are getting it. People are saying, “This isn’t my stack, this is my – and this is what I’m taking in the morning. This is what I’m taking at noon and this is what I’m taking late in the afternoon. Have you got any suggestions?” Usually I would change this one thing. People are getting it now, which is just the coolest thing. \xa0 [01:44:33]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0I love that you interact with them because then those comments are there for years to come and people can even though you’re answering one person’s question, you’re actually helping thousands of people because they’re all going to go there and read your answer. \xa0 [01:44:48] David Tomen:\xa0And they’re doing that. Some of these threads are years old. \xa0 [01:44:55]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Nice. I love it. I love that you’ve built this forum to help people. You put a lot out there. You put a lot of work into it. You give a lot for free and if someone wants the additional help of that personalized help, one on one, they could work with you and they could buy some supplements from you because you figured out some of the brands the you liked. They could also buy your book. Of course, the links to everything you do including your YouTube channel, we’re going to make sure that is in the show notes of today’s podcast. I have to commend my transcriptionist right now because the entire time I’m like, “Oh my gosh. I just have to say to my transcriptionist, as you’re transcribing this right now, I’m sending you hugs and I thank you so much for taking probably a week to transcribe this interview.” But my listeners are going to be really appreciative of the transcription because once it’s published on\xa0learntruehealth.com\xa0they can go and they can read everything that David said so they can reference. This is a very technical interview and they can reference all the wonderful supplements that David talked about. The doses and everything. Let’s just thank and commend the transcriptionist for doing a great job. Awesome. David, it was such a pleasure having you on the show toady. Is there anything you’d like to say to wrap up today’s interview? Anything left unsaid? \xa0 [01:46:34] David Tomen:\xa0Just get started. If you haven’t started doing any of these yet just please get started. \xa0 [01:46:41]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0That’s a really simple like if someone kind of overwhelmed at this point? What’s a good like just get a toe in the door or toe in the water? \xa0 [01:46:50] David Tomen:\xa0You know, take something. Take something and see if it works. There’s so much information available now on a place like Nootropics Expert. Whatever you’re dealing with, whatever it is. If it’s anxiety or depression or ADD or OCD or traumatic brain injury or PTST or whatever it is. Use the search function over on Nootropics Expert and put it on the search box. \xa0 [01:47:16]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0And if you’re not taking a great multi vitamin like a multi B, start with that. Start there. \xa0 [01:47:23] David Tomen:\xa0The Performance Lab Multi I think it is the best multi-vitamin I’ve ever used. You can find my full review on Nootropics Expert Performance Lab Wholefood multi for men and women. The B vitamins complex that it recommends is the one by Life Extension. \xa0 [01:47:42]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0That is on your website? \xa0 [01:47:45] David Tomen:\xa0I don’t think that one is on my website. You’ll find it probably in the comments section in the places but I don’t think I’ve put a link to that one there. The Life Extension has got a really, really good B complex it’s called complete bioactive something like that. The nice thing is that it uses folate instead of folic acid and methylcobalamin instead cyanocobalamin and the B vitamins are the right dosages. \xa0 [01:48:15]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Very cool. I take a powder that turns to a liquid and I was designed my naturopath but I really enjoyed itbut I’m going to check out you’re too. I know you sell, do you sell supplements? I don’t own the company I just work as an affiliate so get a little bit of money every time somebody clicks the link and buys one of these things. I’ve got a link to the website. \xa0 [01:48:45] Ashley James:\xa0You’ll give me links so that listeners who want to make sure that you get credit for spending the time to put this out there. They want to make sure you get the credit we’ll make sure the link is in the show notes. \xa0 [01:49:00] David Tomen:\xa0Okay, thank you. \xa0 [01:49:01]\xa0Ashley James:\xa0Awesome. Very cool. Thank you so much for coming on the show. This has been wonderful. \xa0 [01:49:04] David Tomen:\xa0Thank you for having me back. \xa0 [01:49:06] Ashley James:\xa0Yes. I look forward to having you again. I think we’ve got lots of topics to explore and I really enjoy. I like interviews that bring the meat. You know what I mean? It’s funny for someone who doesn’t eat meat, I want a lot of meat in my interview. I want a lot. I want people to walk away going, “Oh my gosh, there’s so much here, there’s so much available. I’m going to get a lot out of this. It’s going to help me change my life.” I want listeners to feel that this is life-changing and you bring the meat.

We dream of the day they decide to be done with alcohol, drugs, pornography, or whatever else, for good.\xa0 Well today, we hear from a woman in our community who’s been married for over 35 years. And her husband has been in and out of recovery for years.\xa0 She’s learned to trust her intuition, come out of denial, and discover herself, whether he’s sober or not. It’s a daily challenge for him, but she has boundaries in place to protect herself, stay in her lane, and be happy, no matter what he’s choosing that day.\xa0 Hear her story, and how she’s found compassion for her husband today.\xa0 Find more here: https://loveoveraddiction.com/their-long-road-to-recovery-and-yours-too/\xa0 Join the community: https://loveoveraddiction.com/ Connect personally: https://www.instagram.com/love_over_addiction/ | When we love someone suffering from addiction, it can be hard to see the light of day. Our once very accurate judgment and perception is now being manipulated into something else.\xa0 I remember feeling so lost, thinking, “What is actually going on?” I felt crazy. Have you ever felt like that?\xa0\xa0 As I started my own recovery and healing, I discovered that there are little tools and tricks that I could use in those moments to find clarity. To remind myself that I’m actually not crazy. I used these tactics day in and day out when I was married to a good man suffering from addiction. So today I share two simple lessons with you that I was reminded of when my ceiling caved in a few weeks ago.\xa0 Find more here: https://loveoveraddiction.com/lessons-when-your-partner-suffers-from-addiction/ Join the sisterhood: https://loveoveraddiction.com/ Connect personally (and see the ceiling): https://www.instagram.com/love_over_addiction/ | Here’s the deal: you reserve the right to change your mind at any time, for any reason.\xa0 Why is that important? Because if you’re anything like me, you put a lot of pressure on yourself to make the “right” choice.\xa0 And sometimes you may even get stuck or frozen in indecision, because you’re too afraid of getting it ‘wrong’. There’s no judgment here. I’ve struggled with this all my life.\xa0 Whether it’s coming from your inner perfectionist, pressures from society\'s expectations, or even friends and family, find out why it’s okay to get it ‘wrong’.\xa0 And why we need to allow ourselves grace and space to mess up.\xa0 Find more: https://loveoveraddiction.com/why-its-okay-to-change-your-mind/ Join our judgment-free community: https://loveoveraddiction.com/ Connect personally and see all the ways I get it ‘wrong’: https://instagram.com/love_over_addiction/ | When I was healing from loving a man suffering from addiction there was one thing that was part of all of my days: self-care. And I know, I get it, self-care is all the rage right now.\xa0 But self-care should meet your needs, and not necessarily be ‘trendy’. My self-care right now is a bowl of ice cream and an episode on Netflix. My self-care has been physical movement, walking with my dog and kids, taking a bath with all my favorite soaps, among other things.\xa0 My point is that it doesn’t matter what you do, but when you can do it every single day, you’ll have a breakthrough.\xa0 For me, it helped me feel more calm, more available to handle the chaos that did come my way, and overall, more grounded.\xa0 Find more details here: https://loveoveraddiction.com/take-care-of-yourself/\xa0 Join our community:\xa0https://loveoveraddiction.com/ Connect personally:\xa0https://www.instagram.com/love_over_addiction/ | Have you ever questioned whether to stay in your relationship or leave? It’s a big question. And that’s frankly an understatement. It’s a life-changing, wildly impactful decision of a lifetime.\xa0 And listen, we never do judgment in this community. So whether you decide to stay or leave, that’s up to you.\xa0 Today’s episode though, it’s about a whisper. A whisper within us that we may hear, or we may not be able to yet. The voice of addiction in our own heads is loud, ugly, demanding, and full of lies. It covers up our own voice. Our whisper within is clouded by the loud ugliness of our partner’s addiction.\xa0 Learn how to uncover your whisper, and more importantly, listen to it.\xa0 Find more here: https://loveoveraddiction.com/listen-to-your-whisper/ Join the sisterhood: https://loveoveraddiction.com/ Connect personally: https://www.instagram.com/love_over_addiction/ | Everything in our life is a season. Some seasons are longer than others, and some may be harder than others.\xa0 No matter what ‘season’ we may be in, we learn tips and tools to help us along the way.\xa0 When I was married to a good man that suffered from addiction, that was one of the hardest seasons of my life. I learned all kinds of tips and tools to handle the disease, and some of these, I still use to this day.\xa0 Today I’d love to share with you one simple tool that you can use every single day.\xa0 I used this tool when I was married to my ex-husband, and I started using it again recently when we moved into our new (99-year-old) house, and it started falling apart.\xa0 Find more: https://loveoveraddiction.com/simple-tool/ Join the sisterhood: https://loveoveraddiction.com/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/love_over_addiction/ | Here’s the loving truth: when you have children living in this situation, with their parent (or step-parent) suffering from addiction, you’ve got work to do.\xa0 You must be the strong and sober parent. You’ve got to protect them, teach them how to be safe, and educate them. You must talk to them about addiction, no matter how awkward it may feel. And I totally understand having fears around it, I did too.\xa0 But you can learn how to talk to them about it, and I have tips for you today.\xa0 Find more here: https://loveoveraddiction.com/talk-to-your-children-about-addiction/\xa0 Connect personally: https://www.instagram.com/love_over_addiction/ Join the sisterhood: https://loveoveraddiction.com/ | I believe in dream boards (or vision boards). And if you don’t know what I’m talking about, just google it.\xa0 They sound incredibly hokey. They sound woo-woo, they sound a little like, "What?" But I stand by them. In my life, I’ve always had at least one vision board. And I’ve got crazy stories about these vision boards throughout my life, which I share in the Love Over Addiction program.\xa0 So today is all about your future. Why it’s important to dream, envision, imagine, and how to actually do that. It’s actually really hard for a lot of people, and it was at first for me too.\xa0 Find more here: https://loveoveraddiction.com/create-a-vision/\xa0 Connect personally: https://www.instagram.com/love_over_addiction/ Join the sisterhood: https://loveoveraddiction.com/ | Stick with me here, because I know self-care is a buzzword right now. I’m not about buzzwords, but I am all about you learning the tools you need to handle this disease.\xa0 When we love someone suffering from addiction, our lives become chaotic and out of control. That’s just the way addiction works.\xa0\xa0 So on today’s episode, we’ll dive deep into your self-care, and how to maintain it during a crisis. It’s an important skill, and worth having these tools in your back pocket for the next time there’s an especially chaotic time. Because addiction gets crazy, and our lives can get completely out of control.\xa0 These are helpful tips for everyday life and during a crisis.\xa0 Find more here: https://loveoveraddiction.com/self-care-during-a-crisis/ Connect personally: https://www.instagram.com/love_over_addiction/ Join the sisterhood: https://loveoveraddiction.com/ | When we love someone suffering from addiction, we will eventually become completely isolated if we’re not already. That’s what addiction wants, and frankly, what it needs to thrive.\xa0 As you know, we believe that we’re not powerless over this disease. There are things you can do to take your power back from addiction, and today is all about finding connection.\xa0 Today I share tips on what kind of friends to look for (and what kind of people you want to avoid), so that you can create friendships and share your story (what’s really going on), with that special person, or two (three at most).\xa0 Find more here: https://loveoveraddiction.com/how-to-choose-friends/ Connect personally: https://www.instagram.com/love_over_addiction/ Join the sisterhood: https://loveoveraddiction.com/', 'chan_desc': "Do you love someone suffering from addiction?

Well, that doesn’t exist. Losing weight doesn’t work that way. But if you want to learn some strategies that you can implement and to make better choices, you’ve come to the right podcast. You can find all the info and links about this episode at https://holisticwellness.ca/episode76  Topics Discussed in this Episode:  How you might be approaching weight loss in the wrong way Getting your mindset right when it comes to weight loss and going beyond the food Strategies to overcome night-time snacking The delayed gratification technique 3 key things to losing weight:  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to losing weight. It’s a combination of multiple things that makes weight loss successful. Night-time snacking is one of the reasons why people gain weight. Can diet supplements be helpful? Absolutely! But that doesn’t mean they’re a magic fix. 3 things that are key to losing weight:   You need a plan to follow. You need accountability. You need a support network.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Do away with diet pills. They won’t get you anywhere. Anticipate the feelings that lead you to night-time snacking and come up with an activity that’ll interrupt that pattern. Implement the delayed gratification technique. Instead of getting up and grabbing the food that you’re craving for right away, take out your phone and set the timer for five minutes, and sit with that uncomfortable feeling. Create a clear and compelling vision for your future health. Declutter your space. You want to be in a space where you feel calm and confident. Find outlets that will help you deal with stress.  \xa0 Samantha said: “When you can better yourself and show up more powerfully in your life, you will make better choices that are in alignment with the life that you truly want.” “You have to show up for yourself. You have to take action. You have to make yourself a priority. You have to invest in yourself. Sometimes that can be really scary but nothing changes if nothing changes.” \xa0 Thanks for listening! \xa0 Important Announcements: My podcast has been nominated for Podcast of the Year!!!

Listen in to one of my Facebook Live recordings, find out more about your hormones, and learn to connect the dots when it comes to your health. You can find all the info and links about this episode at https://holisticwellness.ca/episode75. Topics Discussed in this Episode:  My hormonal health story The hormonal Charlie’s Angels: cortisol, estrogen, and thyroid What happens when these three hormones are out of balance versus when they’re in balance Some simple strategies that you can do to support these hormones  Key Takeaways:  Whether you’re fired up from work with your to-do list or fired up from running from a tiger, they’re the same stress to your body and it’s going to take a toll on your immune system. If you had caught some kind of viral infection, bacterial infection, or parasite infection in the past, if you haven’t been able to heal them appropriately, they can start to show up in your later years. Cortisol is a very smart, no-nonsense, strategic-thinking hormone. It’s alert in your nervous system to threats.\xa0 If you are experiencing weight gain, cortisol and insulin are the two hormones you want to look at as both are fat-storing hormones. When you are constantly stressed, the communication between your brain and your adrenals is impaired, that’s why you experience adrenal burnout. A dysregulated cortisol could lead to diabetes, metabolic syndrome, depression, low sex drive, low thyroid, fatigue and exhaustion, irregular and heavy periods, autoimmune conditions, infertility and PCOS, and accelerated aging. Your thyroid is what controls your metabolism. When you have dysregulated thyroid, you’re going to feel sluggish, run-down, and tired. You’re going to experience infrequent bowel movement, and you might be constipated. You might also experience unexplained weight gain, depression, feeling inflamed, excessive menstrual bleeding, and excessive hair loss. Your estrogen is so important because it helps to produce your serotonin. When your estrogen is out of balance, you might experience very low libido, very dry skin, increased hunger, a lack of ovulation, a heavy period, more breast tenderness around your cycle, fibroids and cysts, more PMS symptoms, more brain fog, and PCOS.  Action Steps:  Connect the dots with your health.\xa0 Look back to your health history and see all these different areas where things could have gone wrong and started to impact your health. Manage your cortisol, estrogen, and thyroid, as well as your insulin and blood sugar. Implement these strategies to support your hormones:   Pay attention to your nutrition and eat an anti-inflammatory whole foods diet. Create a healthy routine around sleep. Make sure you stay hydrated all the time. Move and sweat. Try acupuncture. Avoid endocrine disruptors. Supplement with Vitamin C.  \xa0 Samantha said: “Your body can’t differentiate between a to-do list that’s super long or running from a lion in the jungle. It’s all a stressor to your body.” “Weight loss isn’t a linear process. Your health in general... it’s about taking the baby steps every single day.” \xa0 Thanks for listening!

Go by how you feel. It’s important to get tested but also to know that there are flaws throughout every test. As long as you’re feeling better, keep going with whatever protocol works for you. The whole point of the Ayurvedic detox is to support your body and balancing it back to where it wants to be so that you can be of optimal health. You have to do what’s right for you and understand how to listen to your body. That’s how you can truly take care of and protect yourself, by listening to your intuition and listening to what your body needs. There is a direct link between suppressing our sexuality and chronic illness.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Try doing the AIP for 9 months. Embrace your sexuality.  \xa0 Kelli said: “You are the only person that could advocate for yourself. You get to make the choices for your life. You want to be healthy, that is your choice for your body.” “When it comes to our health, we want quick fixes and we have lots of excuses.

Best-selling author of The Healing Power of Essential Oils, Dr. Eric Zielinsk shares great blends, tools, strategies, and tips about essential oils. We also talk about all things food and how you can eat a bio-active rich diet.\xa0 You can find all the info and links about this episode at https://holisticwellness.ca/episode73.  Topics Discussed in this Episode:   Expanding your healing toolkit Dr. Z’s healing journey   \xa0  The Essentials Oils Diet and what it means to eat a bio-active rich diet  \xa0  How Dr. Z got started with essential oils What you should have in your essential oil medicine cabinet Essential oils for mood, energy, and sex Essential oils for healing the gut  Key Takeaways:  Oils aren’t going to be the magic bullet for healing whatever condition you might have. They are part of your healing toolkit. It’s the same thing with supplements. There’s no one magical thing that’s going to be the “healer”, it’s a combination of things. Having all these different modalities that we have access to and expanding our healing toolkit means that we’re also going to experience greater, faster healing. Citrus oils are proven anti-depressants. Once you have your arsenal of oils, you can make your own blends. Deep breathing and good posture help feed the body with good oxygen and good nutrition, and essential oils can help with that. Peppermint has been shown to increase respiratory rate and help athletic performance. It also has fantastic pain-relieving properties. Your body completely metabolizes essential oils. You don’t have to worry about the biochemical buildup. There are natural approaches that our body does well with, that we don’t have to worry about side effects.  Action Steps:  If you want to improve your health, focus on your pain point and start to look at solutions, one at a time. Focus on the true nutritional value of food, which has nothing to do with carbs, calories, vitamins, and minerals. Don’t deprive yourself or your kids of “normal” food but find ways to “healthify” the food that people normally eat. Take a look at your medicine cabinet and categorize the essential oils you have there. Make your own blends and come up with your own solution to boost your mood and energy, and address all kinds of aches and pains.  \xa0 Eric said: “That’s probably the most dangerous place someone can get is when you’re numb, that’s when life and death really don’t matter to you anymore. And a lot of people are getting numb right now.” “The best advice I can give to anyone who wants to improve their physical health is focusing on their pain point …and then start to look at solutions to find for that particular thing.’ \xa0 Thanks for listening!

Healing & Dealing with Hashi’s  | What is gluten and how is it potentially impacting your health? And how can you manage chronic inflammation? In this episode, I dive into all things gluten and share some simple things that you can do to optimize your health and your hormones and manage inflammation. You can find all the info and links about this episode at https://holisticwellness.ca/episode72. Topics Discussed in this Episode:  What you need to know about gluten Why you need to consider going gluten-free Acute inflammation versus chronic inflammation What causes chronic inflammation and its long-term health effects The ways to manage inflammation and optimize your health  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  Gluten causes gut inflammation in at least 80% of the population. Thirty percent of the population that develops antibodies against gluten proteins in the gut. At least 99% of the population has the genetic potential to develop antibodies against gluten. Especially if you have an autoimmune condition or you are type 1 diabetic, cutting out gluten is going to lessen the inflammatory load on your body. Gluten’s inflammatory effect on the gut causes intestinal cells to die prematurely and the oxygenation of those cells, which results in a leaky gut. Chronic inflammation isn’t just caused by inflammatory foods but also by psychological stress and sleep deprivation.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Go on a 21-day gluten elimination diet and then re-introduce it slowly and see how you feel. Think about long-term health and not just how you want to feel now but also how you want to feel in the future, especially as you start to age. Manage your inflammation and optimize your health:   Eat real, whole foods and remove the toxins and inflammatory foods in your diet. Cut out gluten, dairy, and sugar. Manage your stress. Eat organic as much as you possibly can, and buy from local sources. Get enough good quality sleep. Exercise regularly and build and maintain muscle mass.  \xa0 Samantha said: “A lot of products will list that they are gluten-free, which is great. But because it’s gluten-free that doesn’t necessarily mean that that’s the better option.” “We can’t take charge of our life if we don’t have optimized health. So that’s truly where it starts.” \xa0 Thanks for listening! \xa0 Important Announcements: Registration is now open for our 8-Week Metabolic Reset Weightloss Program.

Healing & Dealing with Hashi’s  | Welcome to another Q&A episode! This time, I answer your questions about navigating the diet dogma, the link between irregular cycles and hypothyroidism, the things you need to consider to support your thyroid, and how to deal with fibroids. You can find all the info and links about this episode at https://holisticwellness.ca/episode71.  Topics Discussed in this Episode:  How to navigate all the diet dogma that are out there The link between irregular cycles and hypothyroidism What the thyroid hormone does to your body The 5 things you need to consider to help support your thyroid How to deal with fibroids  Key Takeaways:  It can be so confusing when we are bombarded every single day from all sides about how we should be eating. The thing is, nobody knows how you should be eating but YOU. If you are going to go vegan or vegetarian, make sure you have variety in your diet and not just relying on grains, beans, and legumes. When it comes to choosing which diet to follow, it comes down to what makes the most sense for you and how you feel best. Hypothyroidism and the menstrual cycle are intimately tied together. While the thyroid hormone isn’t a sex hormone, it does play a key role in keeping your period regular. Every cell in your body needs the thyroid hormone, including your brain and your ovaries. It’s essential for follicle development in the ovary, which is a very necessary step in ovulation. The 5 areas that impact your thyroid and your body overall:   Heavy metals\xa0 Stealth and latent infections Environmental toxicities Emotional trauma and chronic stress Nutrient deficiencies   Fibroids are a symptom, not a root cause. And no matter how big or small your fibroids are, you always want to address the root cause.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Tune in to your body. When it comes to how you should be eating, only YOU know what’s right for you.\xa0 Do not get caught up in the diet dogma. At the end of the day, you just have to experiment and see what works for you. Make sure that you’re getting your thyroid tested and you’re getting a full panel, and then work with a practitioner who can look at those tests and assess where you might need support. Support your thyroid.   Make sure you’re on the right medication or supplementation. Address your adrenals and your stress. Make sure you’re eating an anti-inflammatory whole foods diet.  \xa0 Samantha said: “Healing can come in many different forms. But this is why, at the end of the day, it really comes down to experimentation. And it also comes down to finding a practitioner who can best guide you because sometimes we just can’t figure it out on our own.” “Sleep and stress go hand in hand. If you are chronically stressed, you are probably not getting good enough sleep -- deep quality sleep. And if you’re not sleeping, you’re not healing.” \xa0 Thanks for listening! \xa0 Important Announcements: The Dutch Test Program is now available in our online clinic!

Healing & Dealing with Hashi’s  | Why is daily pooping important? Jillian Teta talks about the importance of optimizing our gut health and its connection to our hormones. We also chat about the things that we can do to positively impact our microbiome and promote digestive health beyond just changing our diet. You can find all the info and links about this episode at https://holisticwellness.ca/episode70.  Topics Discussed in this Episode:  The digestive process in a nutshell The connection between your gut health and your hormones How to overcome constipation Strategies that you can implement to support your gut Why it’s important to maintain a healthy and robust microbiome The two options for stool testing What candida is and how to get rid of it The optimal gut-healing diet What gluten does to your body in terms of digestion and autoimmunity The elimination challenge diet The role that nature plays in the health of your microbiome Jillian’s thoughts on the carnivore diet  Key Takeaways:  Your gut acts like the Grand Central Station of your entire body. It is intimately connected with every other cell and system in your body, including the hormonal system, the detoxification system, the immune system, the neurological system, and the cardiovascular system. The gut holds two of the big five organs of detoxification -- the liver and the large intestine. The liver is primarily in charge of metabolizing and neutralizing estrogen. Once estrogen is neutralized, it is sent to the large intestine to be expelled out of the body. If you’re not pooping every day, that means your estrogen is sitting in your stool, and it gets reabsorbed back into the system and ends up back in the liver. This contributes to estrogen dominance. About 20% of your thyroid hormone T4 is converted to the active form T3 via the activity of your microbiome. If your microbiome is not healthy, it’s arguable that this conversion is compromised. Candida is part of a normal human gut flora. Issues can arise if it overgrows. This happens when one of our defenses is breached, usually due to an antibiotic knocking out your beneficial flora. Gluten is not universally terrible for everybody, but it’s a fact that it causes an issue for the gut and impacts autoimmunity. Sleep is absolutely key for digestive health. When we sleep, the parasympathetic branch of our nervous system becomes more active.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Make sure that you poop every day. Overcome constipation quickly and easily by drinking lots of water and supplementing with magnesium glycinate. Heal your gut through your diet. If you have an autoimmune condition, avoid gluten at all cost. If you absolutely have to take antibiotics, make sure to take probiotics alongside it.  \xa0 Jillian said: “If you think about that large intestine as a parking lot, you want all those spaces filled with good guys. If you take an antibiotic and knock some of those good guys out, the highly opportunistic fast-growing microorganisms are going to move in.” “I think we overemphasize candida, and I think we emphasize the wrong types of information about candida. And I think it created a culture that thinks that everybody and everything has candida.” \xa0 Thanks for listening! Important Announcements: Join my FREE 10-Day Detox!

Healing & Dealing with Hashi’s  | How can we combat sugar cravings and support our microbiome? Learn some tips from Joy McCarthy of Joyous Health as she shares her story of overcoming her sugar addiction. We also talk about how we can heal our microbiome and keep it healthy, raising resilient kids, entrepreneurship, and more! You can find all the info and links about this episode at https://holisticwellness.ca/episode69. \xa0 \xa0 Topics Discussed in this Episode:  How Joy overcame her sugar addiction Symptoms of sugar addiction Tips to combat sugar cravings The microbiome and how we can support it Studies involving the microbiome Joy’s favorite gut-healing foods The carnivore diet and how it affects the microbiome Nourishing the microbiome in babies and children Raising resilient children The ups and downs on entrepreneurship and tips for running your business  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  When it comes to fighting sugar addiction, it’s not just about taking away certain foods from your diet but about adding in what’s healthy for you. We have trillions of microbes in and on our body that affect everything, from our mood to the health of our skin to the health of our immune system, and a large concentration of them are in our gut, particularly the colon. Polyphenols are phytonutrients that act as prebiotics. The nutrients in fermented foods are so much more bio available, such that they really optimize and help your digestive system and your body overall. Phytonutrients are what give plants their beautiful color. So if you want to make sure you eat a gut-friendly diet, make sure you’re eating a lot of different colors. When a baby travels through the birth canal, that’s essentially its first touchpoint with the microbiome.  Action Steps:  Retrain your palate. Make sure that you eat lots of plant-based foods. Eat fermented foods (if you can). When shopping for food, fill your cart with a variety of colors, and eat a rainbow Do everything you can to try and breastfeed your baby. Avoid antibiotics for the health of your child’s microbiome.  \xa0 Joy said: “Anyone who’s ever done a sugar detox knows that once you cut out those refined sugars and artificial sweeteners, that things that are sweet are so much [sweeter].” “You are in charge of your own health. You are responsible for your own health, and you know your body better than anybody else.

Healing & Dealing with Hashi’s  | Summer is finally here! And it’s only fitting that we talk about the sun and its impact on our health. Here at the 5 myths that you need to know about the sun and your skin. You can find all the info and links about this episode at https://holisticwellness.ca/episode68.  Topics Discussed in this Episode:  The 5 myths you need to know about the sun and your skin The harmful chemicals that you need to avoid in sunscreens How to practice natural sun safety Foods rich in antioxidants that will help nourish and protect your skin What products to invest in for sun protection  Key Takeaways:  It’s not true that sunscreen reduces skin cancer rates. According to the Environmental Working Group, skin cancer rates are rising despite our increase in the use of sunscreens. High SPF doesn’t mean better sun protection. SPF values refer only to UVB rays, not UVA or UVC. UVA and UVC rays penetrate more deeply into the skin and cause damage to the DNA. Sunscreens with added antioxidants are not necessarily better for you. Wearing oils with natural SPF is not enough for sun protection. If you’re not wearing something that’s broad-spectrum, you’re not blocking all of the UV rays. Although vitamin D is important for overall cancer protection and we need to get our vitamin D from sun exposure, we still need to practice sun safety.  Action Steps:  Be conscious of the harmful chemicals that may be present in your sunscreen. Be conscious of how much time you’re spending outside and how much sun exposure you’re actually getting. Practice natural sun safety. Wear long, light layers that will cover your skin, as well as a hat and sunglasses. Choose all-natural, organic sunscreen with broad-spectrum protection.  \xa0 Samantha said: “UV radiation, it increases free radical damage in our bodies, but antioxidants counteract that free radical damage. So you want to make sure you are including antioxidant-rich foods [in your diet] that are really going to help nourish and protect your skin.” “Our life on this planet needs sunshine and it’s not the enemy. It’s just practicing safe sun protection and being conscious about our time spent out in the sun. It is vital that we get sun exposure, and it really isn’t the problem.” Thanks for listening! \xa0 Important Announcements: Connect with me over on Instagram, @holisticwellnessfoodie!

Healing & Dealing with Hashi’s  | Do you want to know more about how to take care of your dental health? In this episode, I share some steps that you can take with your diet to support your teeth and reverse cavities. Also, the dental routine that you can do to have the whitest, brightest, and healthiest smile ever!\xa0 You can find all the info and links about this episode at https://holisticwellness.ca/episode67.  Topics Discussed in this Episode:  Reversing cavities with Salty Kisses Toothpaste and the Hippie Floss Oil What your teeth can tell you about your health How we get tooth decay Healing and preventing cavities What to eat to prevent cavities Things to note about oral care products What your daily dental routine should look like  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  Your teeth can tell you a lot about your health, from cardiovascular health to inflammation. Your teeth and gums have a direct impact on certain organ systems and vice versa. If you have certain issues or symptoms you’re experiencing systemically in your body, this can be a sign that something might be going on with your teeth. Tooth decay is a serious issue. In fact, it’s a true disease. Toothpaste should be safe to ingest. 50% of the bacteria in your mouth is actually on your tongue, so it’s vital to also clean your tongue.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Care for your teeth and gums regularly. Follow the dental diet. Eat clean, whole foods:   Organic fruits and vegetables Fresh and dried spices and herbs High-quality fats Pasture-raised, grass-fed meats and dairy Vitamin C Vitamin D Phosphorus-rich foods Mineral-rich and quality carbohydrates   Invest in a tongue scraper. How to make a salt rinse:   Fill a mason jar with some warm good-quality water. Drop in a chunk of Himalayan sea salt. Let the sea salt dissolve. Feel free to add some antibacterial essential oils.  \xa0 Samantha said: “We don’t often relate the health of our teeth to the health of our overall body. But the reality is we build up hundreds of bacteria on our teeth and our gums on a daily basis simply just by what we eat and what we drink.” “I want you to really become your own self-dentistry specialist because then you can visit the dentist less and save more money.” \xa0 Thanks for listening! \xa0 Important Announcements: Registration is now open for the Summer Edition of the Metabolic Reset Program!

In this chat he bettered my life just by instilling in it that a cluttered house leads to a cluttered mind -- and since we’ve hung up the call I’ve been a born again declutterer. The proof is in his pudding, and Ken’s pudding is helping entrepreneurs, executives and high achievers across the globe to gain clarity, take action and get results in their personal and professional life. Many of his clients actually call him “The Clarifier” thanks to his unique ability to help them simplify and solve their most pressing issues.

But how about we all stop calling him things and roll the interview so you can come to your own conclusions!\xa0 \xa0 Press play to hear:  Why Feng Shui isn’t at all what you think it is Why a cluttered house and a cluttered mind go hand-in-hand and what you can do about it Tips for kitchen organization… from the pro How one life-changing moment led this home styling master to change his life The five biggest things that Ken Lauher’s clients actually want\xa0 How organizing your home leads to transformations and breakthroughs that’ll get your mojo back Why the bagua is… not that great Why beating yourself up about clutter and cleaning is actually harming your soul You have a choice!!

Well, as my phenomenal functional medicine practitioner friend Dr. Will Cole says in this chat: you don’t have to be wealthy to be healthy.\xa0 \xa0 Dr. Cole, or Will, is doc who relies zilch on prescriptions on mucho on natural fixes. He’s obsessed with finding the roots of health problems and honestly, in this chat I became obsessed with finding out his answers to every single thing that came to my mind. It turns out, this brilliant man is not only a healer, but also a quote generation machine, and he was dropping some serious poetic responses. Something he said that really stuck with me was: “Just because it’s common, doesn’t mean it’s normal.” Out of context, that could apply to basically anything (headphones getting tangled the minute they enter a purse, my dog humping his bed when he’s mad at us, me crying when I watch Monica and Chandler get engaged even though I’ve seen that episode upwards of 39 times…) but in the context of our conversation, he was saying that so many folks struggle with so many “common” health issues today, but that shouldn’t mean that accept them as “normal” and live a life less good. \xa0 This chat is also just what the doctor ordered because finally, FINALLY, hooha, I had an expert on the show who really broke down inflammation. You know, that word you keep hearing but don’t really, truly, honestly, understand?

Party in My Plants on Instagram Party in My Plants on Facebook Party in My Plants’ Cooking Videos on YouTube | My guest today has gone through a long and winding and challenging journey with chronic illness and autoimmune disease. The way she is now though — charmingly hilarious and fantastically bubbly — is kind of a great case-in-point example of one of her biggest teachings: you’re more than your illness. Much, much more. Nitika Chopra is the strong and loving voice behind the podcast The Point Of Pain, which is a place where others with chronic illness in their past share their stories. Surprisingly, there’s a lot of laughter on her show — as there was in this one. (She’s called her conference for those with ongoing illnesses “Chronicon” so you know she’s got a fan of the humor thing…) Personally, I’ve never had a guest pointedly say they’re not into trees, grass and alllll things nature, but by revealing her opposition to the great outdoors Nitika, a thriving vibrant walking taking billboard of health proved her thesis: that knowing yourself well enough to know your needs is the secret to wellness. Speaking of billboards we also talk about what it was like to be a swimsuit model for a hot sec! And vision boards! That’s kind of like a dream billboard for your bedroom, right?

He’s also a plant-chef, nature guy, remarkable analogy creator, and the brains and soul behind Plant People, a company that’s spreading the word about the power plants can have on the wellness of not just individuals, but a whole society. Sure, Plant People is one of the billion brands boasting the brilliance of CBD these days but his mission his to not just be a CBD company - rather, to showcase using herbs and other plants can make us better. And Gabe is not your average “ohhh lemme capitalize on this CBD craze” kinda guy either. He’s the kind of guy who saw through a back fracture injury he got while skiing and used the experience to recognize the value of herbs and hemp. Since then, he has been spreading the word while using part of his profits to plant trees in the U.S. His cause is now to mend people, mend the earth and connect with both. They say when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.

And Trader Joes. We recorded this chat on national avocado day and believe me, this convo was all I could have *avo* wanted. (OK, sorry for the *guacward* pun...) What I love about this chatty Canadian (yes, she did say sorry and yes, I did make fun of her accent) is that she had such a down-to-earth approach to healthy eating and happy living. Her relationship with food has never been a rocky one and so her words are confident and refreshing to hear. We talk about how she found her calling, what it’s been like running her vlog from the bottom now she here, her new brand for plant loving pups, meditation, smoothie recipes, body shaming, and her upcoming book debut.

Party in My Plants on Instagram Party in My Plants on Facebook Party in My Plants’ Cooking Videos on YouTube | Dr. Josh Axe is that dude (and doctor) who seems to have it all figured out. He’s a certified doctor of natural medicine, a doctor of chiropractic and a clinical nutritionist with a passion for helping people get healthy by empowering them to use nutrition to fuel their health. Men’s Health calls him a guru of all things ayurvedic medicine and ancient Chinese medicine, and when I feel like I need to find the culprits of anything that ails me or get the trusted and research backed lowdown on the latest popular plant or wellness trend, I visit his website A BUNCH. As do 17 million other people…a month. I love getting to sit down with a doc who can spill smart stuff on any topic I ask about. In this chat Dr. Axe dished out some wisdom on everything from deplorable keto diet mistakes (it’s NOT about butter fried cheese with bacon, thank you very much) to sneaky and yummy ways to up your herbs and spice intake (if you’re not already on the turmeric band wagon, we’ll getchu there!) and he even takes us a little into woo-ville when he talks about how poor emotional health can lead to major organ health!

Party in My Plants on Instagram Party in My Plants on Facebook Party in My Plants’ Cooking Videos on YouTube | My guest today hits the nail right on the head when she says “we live in a drinking world.” Georgia Foster is a hypnotherapist originally from Australia, who has spent many years living in London and as such, she knows a thing or two about the prevalence of drinking cultures. Georgia’s aim in her work is to teach people how to establish healthy relationships with booze and to learn how to drink less rather than have to break up with that glass of vino forever. In this chat that has truly stuck with me at all of my drinking events since, we dive into how our anxiety and specifically, our inner critics, are the biggest enablers of over-drinking. If you know your inner critic is ruining (or running!) your life, don’t freak out! Georgia had more than a few practical tips to retrain your brain and rely on that happy hour drink a little less. What I liked most about this conversation is that Georgia is by no means the booze police and that her cool-as-a-cucumber approach is ACTUALLY realistic because no, she’ll never tell you not to enjoy a good party, she’s just helping us all have happier inner dialogue so our critics don’t run rogue.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 Press play to hear:\xa0 \xa0  The difference between an alcoholic and someone who is trying to drink less The drinking personalities: perfectionists versus people pleasers Why your inner critic is encouraging you to pop bottles and pour that extra glass Why switching up your drink of choice is likely to turn you into a hot mess Why weddings can cause pressure to drink too much and what to do about it How getting anxiety in check directly relates to better habits around drinking\xa0 How drinking allows us to spend time without our inner critics and can therefore lead to overdoing it What your tipsy self is trying to communicate with you\xa0 Techniques to stop anxiety and prepare for healthy nights out with alcohol And more!  \xa0 Links related to this episode: The full show notes with all the deets from this episode!

Party in My Plants on Instagram Party in My Plants on Facebook Party in My Plants’ Cooking Videos on YouTube | My guest today is a Holistic Nutrition-turned-Business Coach and yoga teacher-turned-productivity preacher who’s obsessed with showing ladies how to weave wellness with work, dodge burnout, and get the good shit done. Abbi Miller’s roots are in yoga but somewhere along the way through her table top poses, cobras and proud warriors, she realized that to be the proudest warrior of all, you have to be able to flow through your work day by balancing your overall wellness. While running her holistic nutrition + yoga biz for 11 years, she’s well versed in the self-employment juggle of feeling exhausted, hangry and face-palming every time you look at your to-do list. That’s why, through private coaching and mentoring, public speaking, transformational events and luxury yoga retreats, Abbi help ladies optimize their life so their health and work flourish like a well-watered-chia-pet. Her combo of wellness with biznass is nothing short of, well, magic. Which is a word she uses a lot. So much so that I would be highly supportive of you turning Abbi’s use of “magic” in this chat into a kombucha drinking game. \xa0 Links related to this episode: The full show notes with all the deets from this episode!

(Meaning, she sells the effects of nature, hard.) You might’ve met Sanni McCandless in the Oscar-Winning documentary film Free Solo, which captured the emotional story of professional rock climber Alex Honnold attempting to conquer the first free solo (a look ma, no hands type of climb) of a famous 900-metre vertical rock face called El Capitan's at Yosemite National Park. While it’s impossible to not be on the edge of your seat while Alex is on the edge of a cliff with just his fingertips and no safety net, when I watched the film, I found myself even more locked into Sanni, his girlfriend. When the film ended and I was able to stop clenching every muscle in my body, I searched for Sanni on the interwebs and was not surprised to find that she’s a passionate entrepreneur compassionately driven to helping people create more tailored, intentional lifestyles. This deep dive with Sanni definitely inspired me to get outside more. She crushed this interview with insight on taking time off work to travel, revamping our routines to create more meaning, eating more plants, appreciating the outdoors, and designing our lives to make the most out of them.

While gathering intellectual knowledge about the plants is essential, it really only gets you so far. Let\'s face it, memorizing facts can be difficult and tedious (and usually not that fun). The best herbalists balance their intellectual knowledge with experiential understanding. And one of the best ways to get that experiential understanding is to taste the herbs. We have to literally "put our medicine where our mouth is!" This episode outlines the importance of the taste of herbs, how we can refine our sensory awareness of herbal tastes, what kind of information we can learn about a plant through it, and some fun ways to build a learning community around our direct experience of medicinal plants.

This was a really fun conversation, as Scott and I discuss a wide range of methods of working with the medicinal intelligence of plants. From how they have the ability to heal us spiritually, to the best wildcrafting and medicine making practices, to what it really means to be an herbalist. Scott and I really have a lot in common in the way we see medicinal plants and the practice of herbalism, even though we approach it from slightly different angles, which to me is fascinating.\xa0 The big thing I appreciate about his perspective and approach, is that it\'s geared towards healing the whole person (body, spirit and soul) through utilizing the whole plant. Scott truly honors the chemical and spiritual sides of herbalism, and understands the greater context of plant medicine, in that the healing work we do contributes to the healing of the Earth as a whole. ———————————— Scott Kloos—ceremonialist, author, wildcrafter, plant medicine maker and practitioner, animist, singer of plant songs, and aspiring integral ecologist—guides The School of Forest Medicine and Cascadia Folk Medicine and is author of Pacific Northwest Medicinal Plants: Identify, Harvest, and Use 120 Wild Herbs for Health and Wellness.

A unique synergy of clinical herbalism, alchemy, medical astrology, and herbal traditions from around the world, The Plant Path focuses on giving you a truly “wholistic” perspective on herbal medicine so you never fall into the trap of allopathic herbalism. | In a similar way that the astrological pattern enables us to see the relationship between the human body, psyche, and soul, so too does it allow us to understand the connection between a plant\'s physical, energetic and spiritual properties. It\'s common in modern day herbalism to have one particular system for understanding the medicinal properties of a plant and how it acts upon the body, and a totally different model for how a plant can heal the mind, heart and spirit. But in a truly holistic model, we see that the physical symptoms of the body are reflections of what\'s going on in the mind and soul. As such, the medicinal properties of a plant are not separate, meaning that the way they heal the mind and spirit is based upon the same pattern in the way they heal the body. The goal of the astro-herbalist, is to learn to see these patterns of relationship between a plant\'s chemistry, energetics and spiritual properties, to see into the essence of the plant – it\'s wholeness – and how it heals the whole person. This essence of the plant is encompassed by its primary astrological, or planetary, "ruler." Each planet in medical astrology has certain qualities and characteristics associated with it that points towards which plants are connected or similar to that planetary quality. This is done through looking at organ rulerships, energetic qualities like temperature (hot/cold), moisture (damp/dry) and tone (tonifying/relaxing), morphological characteristics as seen through the doctrine of signatures, tastes, and other properties. For example, with Cayenne pepper we see a bright red coloration of the fruits which exhibit a highly pungent, aromatic taste. It has a primary affinity for the heart, blood, and cardiovascular system and a very warming and drying energetic quality. It stimulates circulation of the blood, promotes diaphoresis, eases musculoskeletal pain and inflammation, and has antiseptic properties as well. All of these properties of Cayenne are directly correlated to Mars, the red planet. Mars rules the blood and its circulation, is hot energetically, governs immunity, fever, inflammation, and pain associated with heat. Many spicy pungent plants relate to Mars, as it\'s the hottest of all the planets. Thus we can see that the properties of this medicinal plant are similar, or sympathetic, to the planet Mars. Based on these signatures, we can start to understand the subtler properties of this plant and how it might operate upon the psychological, emotional and spiritual levels as well. Mars also relates to our willpower, the action we take out in the world and our ability to exhibit a "warrior spirit." It\'s common for people with excessive Mars to be overheated both physically and psychologically, which can express as anger, irritability, frustration, or a controlling/domineering nature. If in deficiency, we\'ll see folks with low willpower and drive, a lack of strength in character and confidence, a timidity in the personality. As Cayenne embodies the force of Mars in such a powerful way, we may see it facilitating upon some of these patterns in the personality of the person that uses it, especially in spagyric preparations of the plant which concentrates this celestial power into the extract. In essence, the pattern of astrology helps the modern herbalist have a system for understanding the holistic properties of plants in ways that reach far beyond merely knowing its actions, energetics, chemistry and medicinal properties. It gives us one language, one pattern, one framework that unites their physical, energetic and spiritual qualities that gets us closer to grasping their essential nature that heals the whole person. ———————————— CONNECT WITH SAJAH AND WHITNEY ———————————— To get free in depth mini-courses and videos, visit our blog at: http://www.evolutionaryherbalism.com Get daily inspiration and plant wisdom on our Facebook and Instagram channels: http://www.facebook.com/EvolutionaryHerbalism https://www.instagram.com/evolutionary_herbalism/ Be sure to subscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyP63opAmcpIAQg1M9ShNSQ ———————————— ABOUT SAJAH ———————————— Sajah Popham, founder of Organic Unity and The School of Evolutionary Herbalism, is committed to creating a new paradigm of plant medicine anchored in herbal, medical, and spiritual traditions from around the world.

A unique synergy of clinical herbalism, alchemy, medical astrology, and herbal traditions from around the world, The Plant Path focuses on giving you a truly “wholistic” perspective on herbal medicine so you never fall into the trap of allopathic herbalism. | As a holistic herbalist, our goal is to work with the WHOLE person. From many traditional perspectives, there are three primary organizational layers of the human being. In Alchemy these are referred to as Salt, Mercury and Sulfur. In Ayurveda it is vata, pitta, and kapha, or prana, tejas, and ojas. The Chinese refer to Jing, Shen, and Chi. From the most simplest orientation, we can say that we have a body, a spirit and a soul- the spirit in this context referring to the vital force, as well as our specific psychological and emotional patterning. For the herbalist, we want our understanding of a person to orient around the physical, psychological and spiritual levels of health. But essential to the holistic model, is that THEY AREN\'T SEPARATE! Rather, the body is the condensed aspect of the soul, and the soul is the most subtle, ethereal, or volatile aspect of the body. They are connected, part that constitute our wholeness. Unfortunately for a lot of herbalists, there is a separation in regards to how the body\'s health is perceived from the health of the mind, emotions and spirit. We may understand the body through its\' anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, or energetics, but then have a totally separate pattern or framework for understanding the psyche and soul. This makes seeing the connections between physical, psychological and spiritual symptoms quite difficult. This is where the astrological model comes in. Through astrology, we have our natal birth chart, which is commonly seen as representing our core personality, qualities and characteristics. In the evolutionary approach to astrology, the chart also shows us our growth edges and what lessons life is presenting to us for our soul to further its development and evolution. But what\'s commonly NOT looked at in astrology, is the fact that the chart also represents our physical body, our organs, systems, tissues and constitution. In this way, through our natal birth chart, we have the ability to see the pattern of relationship between what\'s happening in our physical body and it\'s connection to the mind, heart, and spiritual growth. This gives the herbalist an incredibly precise and specific tool for holistic assessment and evaluation, especially for those with an interest in attending to helping people beyond their physical health. \xa0 ———————————— CONNECT WITH SAJAH AND WHITNEY ———————————— To get free in depth mini-courses and videos, visit our blog at: http://www.evolutionaryherbalism.com Get daily inspiration and plant wisdom on our Facebook and Instagram channels: http://www.facebook.com/EvolutionaryHerbalism https://www.instagram.com/evolutionary_herbalism/ Be sure to subscribe to our YouTube Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyP63opAmcpIAQg1M9ShNSQ ———————————— ABOUT SAJAH ———————————— Sajah Popham, founder of Organic Unity and The School of Evolutionary Herbalism, is committed to creating a new paradigm of plant medicine anchored in herbal, medical, and spiritual traditions from around the world.

And by "whole plant," we aren\'t referring to the root, leaf, flower and seed/fruit of the plant, but rather using its holistic medicinal nature: chemistry, energetics and spirit, which will then heal the persons body, mind and soul. But there\'s a bigger picture to what "whole-istic" healing really encompasses, a bigger picture that is brought in through the unique lens of medical astrology. The practice of Astro-Herbalism isn\'t just looking at the whole plant and how it heals the whole person, but also understanding the holistic nature of people and plants in relationship to the wholeness of life itself: to Nature and Cosmos. What medical astrology does for our practice of plant medicine is provide a truly holistic framework that enables us to see and understand the patterns of relationship between the physical, energetic and spiritual properties of people and plants. Rather than having one system for understanding the body, and whole other model for understanding the spiritual side of things, astrology brings them together into a singular, cohesive and comprehensive model that ultimately grasps the wholeness of people and plants. From classification of medicinal plants, herbal actions and energetics, to anatomy, physiology, and pathology, and even into formulation, administration, and diagnostics, medical astrology unites the various aspects of holistic herbalism, giving us a single language that connects people and plants to the universal forces of life and Nature. ———————————— CONNECT WITH SAJAH AND WHITNEY ———————————— To get free in depth mini-courses and videos, visit our blog at: http://www.evolutionaryherbalism.com Get daily inspiration and plant wisdom on our Facebook and Instagram channels: http://www.facebook.com/EvolutionaryHerbalism https://www.instagram.com/evolutionary_herbalism/ Be sure to subscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyP63opAmcpIAQg1M9ShNSQ ———————————— ABOUT SAJAH ———————————— Sajah Popham, founder of Organic Unity and The School of Evolutionary Herbalism, is committed to creating a new paradigm of plant medicine anchored in herbal, medical, and spiritual traditions from around the world.

Being an herbalist in the United States is a little bit of a grey area, as there are thousands of practitioners out there helping people with plants that aren\'t necessarily licensed physicians. This is in certain ways a blessing because there is no governmental body telling us how to (and how not to) practice herbalism. But it does lead to legal concerns. In essence, it comes down to how we communicate about the work that we do. As herbalists we are not legally able to diagnose, prescribe medicine, or treat disease. Rather, we holistically evaluate and assess a person, make suggestions in regards to diet, lifestyle, herbs and supplements, and support the health of people\'s organ systems and tissues. Simply by making sure we shape our language and communication in how we approach our work is one of the best ways for protecting ourselves. This also brings us questioning around certification for becoming a practicing herbalist. Again, there is no overarching governmental body that oversees this. In North American, the American Herbalist Guild (AHG) provides the most universally recognized herbal practitioner certification, where one becomes a Registered Herbalists (R.H.) with the AHG.

This is the way I eat and there are no other options.” - Jimmy Moore  Paid advertisement  We all have those moments in life, and for health podcaster and international bestselling author Jimmy Moore it hit him hard the day before this episode of JIMMY RANTS. For a lot of people, having a stressful moment or time of depression can lead them to eat junky, mostly carbohydrate-based foods (because the brain is looking for a dopamine hit). Listen to hear Jimmy share how these moments don’t need to turn into a carbfest and what you can do to stay true to your low-carb, keto lifestyle when these times hit hard in this episode.  \xa0  Paid advertisement  |    While Jimmy is gone on a much needed and deserved sabbatical for six months to rest and recuperate, we will be bringing you the best of the best from the vast archive of shows that Jimmy has accumulated over the last 15 years. We also will be airing shows from his wildly popular JIMMY RANTS live show that originated on Instagram Live and now resides at JimmyRants.com.    Paid advertisement   “This is not just a problem for the citizens of the West in their 60’s, we are now seeing children developing these diseases that are caused by our diet. It really is a problem that is affecting everybody.” Dr. Jason Fung  Paid advertisement  Dr. Jason Fung\xa0forever changed the way we think about obesity with his best-selling book,\xa0The Obesity Code. Now he has set out to do the same for type 2 diabetes with his brand new release\xa0The Diabetes Code. Today, most doctors, dietitians, and even diabetes specialists consider type 2 diabetes to be a chronic and progressive disease—a life sentence with no possibility of parole. But the truth, as Dr. Fung reveals in this paradigm-shifting book, is that type 2 diabetes is reversible. Writing with clear, persuasive language, he explains why conventional treatments that rely on insulin or other blood-glucose-lowering drugs can actually exacerbate the problem, leading to significant weight gain and even heart disease. The only way to treat type 2 diabetes effectively, he argues, is proper dieting and intermittent fasting—not medication. On today’s show we bring you a “greatest hits” of Dr. Fung’s appearances on The LLVLC Show. Sit back and enjoy this special episode with one of the most prominent voices in diabetes care and obesity treatment.  \xa0  Paid advertisement  |    Today we have a special JIMMY RANTS on The LLVLC Show for you.

Paid advertisement   “If somebody is doing a key word search for something in alternative health, the chance is they won’t find it from Google. It’s time we boycott and find a different service.” Jimmy Moore  Paid advertisement  Most people generally recognize the idea of censorship as an extremely bad thing that suppresses freedom of consumer access to information to help them make informed decisions in their life. But when the largest and most recognized search engine in the world decides to engage in it with the sole purpose of silencing those voices that run counter to conventional wisdom on things like diet and health, it becomes a very serious issue. Read the story below from Mercola.com which is one of the victims of a new algorithm update on June 3, 2019 to the Google search feature resulting in a 99% loss of traffic in just a few short weeks.  Google buries Mercola in their latest search engine update Dr. Mercola isn’t the only experiencing this decline in traffic as health podcaster and international bestselling author Jimmy Moore points out. Listen to learn more about why this change took place and what steps fans of the alternative and holistic health message can do (BOYCOTT GOOGLE!) to counter the silencing of opposition voices in this episode.  \xa0  Paid advertisement  |    Today we have a special JIMMY RANTS on The LLVLC Show for you.

Paid advertisement   “Would it surprise you to learn that it’s better to eat no food at all than to eat too few calories? It’s true.” -Jimmy Moore  Paid advertisement  The 7-Day Water Fasting Challenge issued by health podcaster and the international bestselling author of THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FASTING with fasting guru Dr. Jason Fung (https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide…) named Jimmy Moore was laid down and 1500+ people committed to doing this fast together with Jimmy’s daily support on his Instagram Live channel. Leading up to the fasting challenge, Jimmy did a series of videos to prepare anyone wanting to try extended fasting. Listen in today as Jimmy addressed the most common myths and why they are wrong in this episode of JIMMY RANTS on The LLVLC Show.  Paid advertisement  |    Former vegan and UK-based author\xa0John Nicholson\xa0is our guest today in Episode 1552 of\xa0The Livin’ La Vida Low-Carb Show with Jimmy Moore!

Paid advertisement   “The change was almost immediate when I started eating meat and the scales fell from my eyes about what I thought about meat eating.” John Nicholson  Paid advertisement  Veganism has become so entrenched in our society as the epitome of “healthy living” that so many people buy into it fully without understanding the hidden consequences of eating this way. Just ask John Nicholson who committed over half of his life to vegetarianism and ultimately to being a vegan for 18 of those years until he began noticing a rather precipitous decline in his health while gaining weight. It wasn’t until his 32-year life partner Dawn, who had been there with John from the time he first embraced plant-based eating, suggested they start eating meat again to regain their health that he made the fateful decision to consume animal products again for the first time in 26 years. Their switch from a low-fat vegan diet to a high-fat meat-based diet was aided in part by the influence of a former vegan named\xa0Lierre Keith\xa0and her groundbreaking book exposing the dangers of vegetarian/vegan diets called\xa0The Vegetarian Myth\xa0(listen to my interview with Lierre in Episode 334\xa0here). John experienced such a quick and dramatic improvement in so many aspects of his health once he added meat back into his diet again that he began on a mission to tell as many people as he could about how animal-based foods saved his health and life. He published a fantastic book about his experience in 2012 called\xa0The Meat Fix: How a Lifetime of Healthy Living Nearly Killed Me!\xa0that he hopes will influence other disillusioned vegans who desperately need to put some meat back into their diet again.

The feeling of well-being and the blood sugar and insulin response benefits are so much bigger than what the scale says.” - Jimmy Moore  Paid advertisement  The 7-Day Water Fasting Challenge created by health podcaster and the international bestselling author of THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FASTING with fasting guru Dr. Jason Fung (https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide…) named Jimmy Moore led a group of 2,000+ of his followers all across his social media channels on a set goal of not eating for a week for the sake of gaining health. This best of episode was from the end of Day 3 of the fasting period and Jimmy addressed some of the more funny questions he had been getting about doing extended fasting (the most hilarious one–will I lose weight doing this?)

Paid advertisement   “Wheat has not been changed by modern genetic modification, it’s been changed by older processes that are not as precise, far more crude, and much worse for us.” Dr. William Davis  Paid advertisement  Today’s\xa0Best Of\xa0interview features one of the most popular authors in the low-carb community. He is Milwaukee, WI-based cardiologist Dr.\xa0William Davis\xa0who wrote an incredible (then) new book warning of the dangers to health and weight of consuming wheat called\xa0Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health. While this seemingly harmless food we are consuming is actually promoted by health experts and in government guidelines as “healthy,” Dr. Davis warns that major changes in the gliadin content of modern-day wheat is what makes it so dastardly for us to be consuming now. This book is one of the more seminal works on this subject that will hopefully spawn even more research and a closer examination by others in the years to come. Plus, Dr. Davis answers these questions from LLVLC Show listeners: DAN ASKS: Thank you Dr. Davis for writing the book “Wheat Belly”. I’ve bought 3 copies to hand out to friends, plus the audio version. It’s making a difference. I’m sure you are receiving lots of success stories. I have lost 145 pounds, one big reason is I put the wheat out. I tell everyone I know to read your book. JAMIE ASKS: If wheat has addictive properties, are their any supplements or even drugs that someone who is wheat addicted might take to help them wean themselves off wheat. Can you list the other grains that have possible wheat like effects? Hops are used in beer. Any thoughts on beer?  Paid advertisement  I’ve listened to the audio version several times.

You use it to make coenzyme A, a molecule that is central to energy metabolism, most famous for forming acetyl CoA, which lies at the intersection of all anabolic (building up) and catabolic (breaking down) reactions. Alex Leaf and I team up again, this time to tackle B5. This is what happens when you don’t have enough:  You get fatigue apathy, discomfort, uneasiness, or pain. You get numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. You may get depressed, quarrelsome, childish, or want to spend all day in bed. Your pulse gets higher than you’d expect after minor exertion. Your sleep gets trashed. You get muscle cramps and abdominal cramps, you fart more, and when things get real bad you might throw up.  Much of this can be explained by pantothenic acid’s role in working all of this magic:  We use it break down fat, protein, and carbohydrate for energy. We use it to synthesize fatty acids, ketones, and cholesterol. We use it to synthesize all of the steroid hormones, including the sex hormones, the glucocorticoids that regulate blood sugar, and the mineralcorticoids that regulate electrolyte balance and blood pressure. We use it to regulate our use of iron properly, including preventing its accumulation in the brain, where it can cause neurological damage. We use it to make melatonin, which tells our body it’s time to sleep. We use it to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in learning, memory, and cognitive performance during periods of sustained, focused attention. We use it to make mucin, which lubricates the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, vagina, penis, and internal organs. We use it to regulate the fasting/feeding cycle by flipping on the genes for autophagy during fasting and flipping on the genes for repair and antioxidant defense during feeding. We use it for quite a few other things too, like the detoxification of some drugs; the synthesis of hemoglobin to prevent anemia; switching on the urea cycle to help us burn protein for energy cleanly; using folate to synthesize DNA, all the major vitamin-derived carriers in the system of energy metabolism, and glycine, an amino acid that acts as a calming, sleep-promoting neurotransmitter, stabilizes blood sugar, and supports collagen synthesis to make your bones strong and your skin smooth.  Burning fat only requires 20% more B5 than burning carbs, which is small compared to how these macros affect riboflavin requirements, However, under conditions of stress you can burn carbohydrate without any B5 at all and you cannot do that with fat. In mice with severe deficiencies of coenzyme A, ketogenic diets dramatically worsen the neurological effects of deficiency. Although pantothenic acid is named for its presence everywhere and in everything using the Greek word “pantos,” and the common dogma is that no one is deficient, Alex and I make the case in this two-part podcast that suboptimal pantothenic acid status might just be the norm. And the crazy thing? Official recommendations suggest we only need about 5 milligrams per day. In the podcast we discuss why some people might need GRAMS per day. Plus, why the FOOD forms might be superior to anything you can get in any supplements on the market. In part 2, to be released on July 5, we’ll cover how to get pantothenic acid in foods, blood tests, and supplements. This episode is brought to you by Ancestral Supplements\' "Living" Collagen.

The ego is an example of this. Many feel that the ego must be conquered or supressed or even completely disregarded or ignored. As though, for some reason, the ego was a mistake and we have to do all we can to ignore or overlook or disown it. The ego is not a mistake, it is not a hindrance, it is not a curse, the ego is our life’s curriculum of ‘doing’ for the expansion of our ‘being’. The ego is actually probably the most important aspect of us in this life and it is an absolutely awesome design. It tells the story of how we think about ourselves and our universe. Everything is mirrored in our ego. >>> | The Body and the MindAs spiritual seekers we are often quite hard on ourselves. In these next two classes we are going to talk about being kinder, specifically the body and the mind whilst in class 50 we will be discussing the ego. To be clear though, even though we will be talking about the body, mind and ego, these are actually just labels for different aspects of the soul. In reality everything is soul, these are just distinctive aspects of the soul we are already familiar with. >>> | Don\'t just do it..The iconic tag of Nike from the 90’s was “Just do it”. This advertising line did a few things, it told the public that the Nike corporation was interested in its customers being more driven, more ambitious to achieve not only their sporting goals but their life goals by doing more. >>> | SufferingIs suffering really necessary? If this is heaven as many say it is, how then can we be free of suffering? In Sunirmalya\'s opinion, the masters of the past might be famous because they suffered so much and offered freedom from suffering after death, but he contends that if heaven is here now, then we have to deal with suffering and our attachment to it. >>> | ResistanceIt turns out that we do not so much have to search for change but let go of our resistance to it. You see, change is a constant. It is natural. There is a flow to our evolution. It is always there, the more we resist it, the more difficult our lives become. There is a natural flow and a natural pace to that change. Our impatience is another form of resistance, telling the universe it is too slow or too fast and it is not to be trusted. We feel we need to inflict our own timeframe, so we disconnect from loving the universe from the natural flow and try and force things in our way and schedule. >>> | Authentic LoveKobi loaded up his gun, adjusted his glasses and helmet and jumped down from the tank. As he ran towards the shot up wall of the small disused school in front of him, he thought for a second of his boys, Kai – the eldest, would have been at school in Melbourne right now, it seemed another planet away.He stopped and gazed through his sights for the enemy and not for the first time, wondered. He wondered why? How? How had it come to this and why do we still fight like this? It felt surreal in that moment, for just then he saw the ‘enemy’ climbing a tree behind a building looking for ‘him’. Or anyone like him. He had no helmet, no glasses, his gun was more of a rifle, but what struck Kobi more than anything was that he was a child. He could be no more than Kai’s age but most likely was younger. He was skinny and malnourished and wearing a scarf over his head, but Kobi could still see his eyes and they immediately haunted him, scarred him. There was so much hate and so much soulless fear. >>> | PerfectionThere is an idea of heaven, of perfection in another place and time, as some kind of Garden of Eden where everything is flawless and nothing ever goes wrong and there is no suffering. But what about the idea that what we have here and now on earth is heavenly but out of ignorance we choose hell?The Garden of Eden scenario is born out of the idea that we are visitors, temporary inhabitants of this strange land with no real express purpose other than to be drifting through to our real final static unchanging destination, heaven. That we are sort of victims of a creator’s wish for us to be readied, to be made perfect, for our real life in the thereafter. That this world is imperfect and full of suffering for some grand reason we don’t quite understand but we will totally comprehend when we are sitting in the clouds free from all misery whilst somehow being oblivious to the suffering of the poor wretched souls still here. >>> | Authentic ProsperityMany people that meditate make all sorts of judgements about their practice of meditation and their levels of material prosperity or financial success.Whilst it is true that meditation creates the mental and spiritual environment for a more balanced and whole person, this does not have any direct correlation to our world’s judgement of success.In fact to be really ‘successful’ or authentically ‘prosperous’ has very little to do with our old paradigms which may be more about being rich or famous. >>> | Your mission statementDouglas Adams, author of the "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy", proffered the whimsical view that the answer was 42, and whilst way back in class 2 our view on the meaning of life was presented it seems poignant that we should revisit this important topic in this class 42 with respect to Mr Adams.In class 2 the idea was introduced that rather than ask what the meaning of life is, we should just consider what moments in our lives have been meaningful so far. Once we spend a moment a two reflecting on this, we realise that every meaningful moment is a moment of love and that everything we do, every endeavour, every art, sport, every music, every thing in the end becomes an experience of love. The simple purport is that to be in the flow of love, giving or receiving love without conditions or expectations or obligations, is the highest thing we can do with our life. We realised that all suffering comes from our distance from the flow of love and all happiness from our immersion in it.Dr Stephen Covey author of the spectacularly successful “The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People” in habit 1, 2 and 3 speaks of the importance of a mission statement. He clearly details the importance of being proactive in our lives. This is the idea of having the ability to respond (“response” -“ability”) to any situation in the way we choose, we create our lives, that we are not victims (see class 40). This mission statement is really the blueprint. For a company or club or organisation, a mission statement gives the vision and goals of the group in a just a paragraph or two. He suggests that all levels of the group be intimately involved in the writing of the mission statement so that they take ownership when it comes time to enact the statement. But more importantly he suggests that mission statements should be written about our own lives. For us to be clear about our target, to be completely present and responsible for our journey, for us to be aligned with our life’s meaning, a mission statement, a proactive statement of intent, is invaluable. >>> | We all know the importance of physical exercise and diet for our physical fitness. We all know it is important to be mindful, to be aware of the thoughts we are thinking and to try and be more positive mentally. But real spiritual strength is something we generally do not understand. We see inspirational people who seem able to, no matter what the calamity, sail through with calmness and equanimity, even taking such events as lessons or blessings. They seem strong, serene in their certainty, powerful in their sureness.How do we become strong, what muscles need to be exercised for us to be spiritually tough?', 'chan_desc': 'This beginners meditation course features a variety of meditation techniques including mantra, meditating with the breath and music, concentration and meditation on a object.

Today\'s podcast is a follow-up to a few of the foods he mentioned. First, we discuss which foods contribute to weight loss and why it works. For example, there are certain foods that increase energy expenditure. Meaning, they have metabolic boosting properties. Metabolism\xa0is the process by which our body converts what we eat and drink into energy. Often when we diet, our metabolism slows down because we need less energy to maintain our body. Having a high metabolic rate not only burns calories but also gives us more energy. There are also ingredients in foods that increase fat oxidation, which can increase fat burning by as much as 10-15%.

But over the last 15 years, studies show that when chronic inflammation lingers, it leaves your body in a constant state of alert. This can lead to chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and even Alzheimer\'s disease. Preventing chronic inflammation and knowing the signs is crucial. Inflammation may be associated with general flu-like symptoms like fever, chills, headaches, loss of energy, and muscle stiffness. Inflammation can also cause redness, joint pain, joint stiffness, or a swollen joint. It can also affect organs like the heart and cause shortness of breath or fluid retention. Chronic inflammation can also lead to weight gain. Protect yourself by learning the causes, symptoms, and treatment of inflammation. Discover all the anti-inflammatory foods you can consume and how to include them in your diet. Today\'s recipes include 5-Ingredient Broccoli Soup and Walnut Pate.\xa0 Thank you to Osea Malibu for sponsoring this week\'s podcast.

It comes from lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or underground sources like aquifers. And any kind of water can become polluted with chemicals, regardless of its size or location.\xa0 According to a new report by the non-profit Environmental Working Group, as many as 43 states expose millions of people to dangerous chemicals in their tap water.\xa0 Residents of Newark, New Jersey recently faced a lead water crisis which put 30,000 residents at risk of lead poisoning.\xa0 And in 2014, the city of Flint, Michigan, switched its water source to the Flint River which led to tainted drinking water that contained lead and other chemicals.\xa0 Children are particularly vulnerable to unsafe tap water. Lead exposure in children can impact brain development and the nervous system.\xa0 Water is such an important topic, and today, we explore how to make sure your tap water is safe to consume.\xa0 Sources cited for:\xa0 Is Your Tap Water Safe to Drink: https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/ https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects.html  https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/search-results.php?zip5=90041&searchtype=zip https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11978586 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10228189 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072821/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19590124  https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/drinking-water-quality-2  https://www.ewg.org/research/report-110-million-americans-could-have-pfas-contaminated-drinking-water#.WwgkkC-ZPBJ Here is the link to the Environmental Working Group Tap Water Database.

Legumes provide a magnitude of essential nutrients that can help you live a longer and healthier life. And science proves that beans contribute to longevity because they cool down systemic inflammation. Inflammation contributes to many long-term diseases including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Chances are legumes, such as beans and lentils are not part of your regular diet. This legumes list provides you with my favorite legumes, and some easy ways to make them part of your regular diet. Legumes List includes: Chickpeas- Also known as garbanzo beans are low in calories, rich in protein, and contain 71% of the RDI for folate. Folate is one of the B-vitamins that is needed to make red and white blood cells. Folate also converts carbohydrates into energy (metabolism) and maintains the genetic building blocks of the body. Chickpeas are an excellent base for sandwiches like this Vegan Chickpea Sandwich with Sun-Dried Tomatoes. Lentils- Lentils are low calorie, high fiber, high protein and contain 90% of the RDI for folate. They can be used to create almost anything from veggie burgers to soups, stews, and salads. My favorite is my east meets west Black Lentil Salad with Apples & Toasted Coconut. Black Beans- Are three times less expensive than beef and chicken and are much more nutritionally dense. They can be the base for any veggie burger or as the perfect taco filler. Cannellini Beans-Make a great salad. Drain some cooked beans, add some chopped sun-dried tomatoes arugula. Top with some fresh lemon juice. Or you can make one of my all-time favorite recipes, Hemp Seeds, Cannellini Beans and Spinach. You can find today\'s Three-Bean Longevity Soup recipe in this week\'s show notes.\xa0 Hope this legumes list inspires you to add more beans to your diet! Thanks for stopping by.

I have made it my mission to provide the safest, highest quality CBD available. | Today, I want to encourage the pursuit of imperfection.\xa0 It\'s called wabi-sabi, and accepting imperfection is the fundamental principal.\xa0 That does not mean to embrace failure. It means to embrace learning and to be willing not to get it entirely right.\xa0 “Wabi means simplicity, humility, and living in tune with nature." It describes someone content with little and makes the most of whatever they have. \xa0“Sabi” refers to transience, beauty, and authenticity of age." The term has its roots in Buddhism but eventually evolved into a distinctly Japanese ideal. The Japanese tradition of wabi-sabi offers an inspiring new way to look at your entire life. It celebrates cracks, crevices and rot and all other marks that time and weather leave behind. So what does this have to do with a vegan diet? Because eating vegan is not about being perfect. And I never want to perpetuate that.\xa0 There is no such thing as a perfect human or a perfect vegan. It is time to celebrate and accept the beauty of imperfection of a vegan diet through wabi-sabi.\xa0 Always remember; when nothing is certain, everything is possible.Hope you enjoy today’s podcast.

The Endocannabiniod System (ECS) is a self-regulating system of receptors that are located throughout the entire body. These receptors work in a lock & key relationship. This vital system is primarily focused on supporting balance (homeostasis) in the body. If the ECS is not functioning correctly, additional nutrition may be necessary for proper support. That is where CBD oil comes in. It balances and enhances the endocannabiniod system. Ordinary Vegan\'s pure CBD oil is tested for the highest purity and potency.

Why? Because according to many reports, Lyme disease caused by ticks, increasingly threaten the health of people all over the world. Most noteworthy, is over the past two decades, seven new tick-borne germs that can cause illness have been identified. According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, the number of reported cases of Lyme disease in the United States, has tripled. The states with highest incidence of this disease is #1 Maine, followed by Vermont, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Maryland, West Virginia, New York, and Virginia. Tick-borne and mosquito diseases are also on the rise in other states like Florida. They have seen a 77% increase in tick-borne disease infections. But, it’s not just in the United States. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, say ticks are abundant in woodlands all across Europe from early spring to late autumn. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most common tick-borne disease in Europe along with Lyme borreliosis. Canada has also seen a higher risk of acquiring Lyme disease. Some patients are reporting that doctors in Canada are not aware of how prevalent it is, making it difficult to diagnose early. Lyme disease has spread to Asia and around the world. According to Popular Science, Lyme disease is thriving because warmer temperatures are making cold places suitable habitats for ticks. One study predicts the incidence of this tick-borne disease will rise around 21% by mid-century because of climate change. And higher temperatures spur ticks to venture farther in search of hosts like deer, squirrels, and mice. Today’s podcast is devoted to teaching you the symptoms and treatment of Lyme disease, and how to protect yourself. Thank you so much for being here!

In fat metabolism the liver cells break down fats and produces energy. It also helps insure that the level of sugar in your blood (aka blood glucose) stays constant.\xa0 Bile is primarily well-known as a digestive secretion that helps to digest fats. Bile also breaks down nutrients from food to produce energy and converts inactive Thyroid Hormone (T4) to active T3 that the cells can use.\xa0 And when harmful toxins and substances enter your bloodstream, your liver acts fast to detoxify and destroy them.\xa0 So keeping your liver healthy is crucial for overall health. Cleansing your liver can also affect your pancreas and help produce normal levels of insulin. You could also see improved blood pressure and better cholesterol numbers.\xa0 In today’s podcast, we discuss 10 ways to cleanse your liver naturally to increase metabolism.\xa0 I am going to begin this 2-3 week liver cleanse to increase metabolism on June 3.

Today we discuss some tried and tested vegan tips to help this process go more smoothly. Here are a few problems we explore. Eating out or not knowing what to feed your non-vegan family can be challenging. These vegan tips should help you survive as a vegan in a multi-vore household. Leading a busy lifestyle, eating out and trying to find quick plant-based options are also addressed. As more and more fast food restaurants offer vegan selections, the simpler it becomes. Learn your options in today\'s podcast. Additionally, it is not always going to be easy, but remember that “straying maps the path.” From the inspiring wisdom of Rumi\'s poem “The Sight Of A Soul.” My interpretation of that poem is until we stray from the path we will never know what is waiting for us. Furthermore, change is scary. But Rumi also says “when you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you.” And big changes, like eating plant-based, bring big positive consequences! I hope today\'s vegan tips help you begin or continue on your path towards veganism. Other topics discussed today include the April 2019 supplement study from researchers from Tuft\'s University.

In December 2018, The Farm Bill was passed making hemp and CBD oil from hemp federally legal. I choose to provide CBD oil\xa0to our community because all CBD is not created equal and many companies import their CBD from China. Those oils can contain contaminants, pesticides and heavy metals. \xa0I wanted to make sure you received the safest and most reliable Vegan CBD oil on the market.

Contrary to what science used to think—that we are victims of our genetics—we realize today that there are so many ways we can live our lives that can positively (or negatively) impact the expression of our genes. We’ve gone\xa0back to the ways of our grandmothers, leaning on ancient wisdom to inform new habits. Nature and nurture are intricately intertwined in the tapestry that is our lives. The great news is,\xa0staying healthy\xa0doesn’t have to be difficult or expensive. Try making these five basics a part of your weekly routine and experience what it will do for your happiness and well-being!" ~Dr. Tieraona Low Dog \xa0 5 TIPS FOR A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE   Eat whole foods.\xa0Rather than reaching for the most convenient processed foods, try to cook meals based around whole foods, and snack on things like nuts and apple slices. Aim for nourishment that is minimally processed, low in added sugars, and diverse. This doesn’t have to mean your food needs to be low in fat or flavor! Some whole foods can be high in fat, like avocados or free range eggs, which we’ve been taught are bad for us, but really aren’t. And with the help of\xa0organic herbs and spices, even the simplest dish can be a feast for all the senses (while also making your foods more healthful in the process!).  Get rest.\xa0Getting the recommended 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night and giving yourself mental rest by unplugging during the day—stepping away from your tablet, putting down your smartphone, and turning off the TV—can do wonders for your well-being. Make space in your life for quiet.  Nourish relationships.\xa0Maintaining your social networks and investing in healthy relationships can be very protective for you. Research has found that people who are socially isolated (a.k.a. “lonely”) experience serious health consequences. Studies have found that being lonely can be\xa0as dangerous as smoking,\xa0being an alcoholic,\xa0never exercising, or\xa0being obese. Find time to have dinner with your family, play\xa0board games\xa0on the weekends with friends, say hello to your neighbor, or take your kids to the nearby park. Stay connected!\xa0 Move your body.\xa0Research shows that around 60 million Americans over the age of six years old get less than 30 minutes of movement a day.\xa0No question, our\xa0 sedentary lives are making us sick. We know that low levels of activity are associated with heart disease, type 2 diabetes, lower back pain, depression, and anxiety. Walk your dog around the neighborhood, use the stairs in your office building rather than the elevator, go out dancing, sign up for a yoga class, take a hike; just keep moving.  Experience nature.\xa0In Japan, there is a common practice referred to as “forest bathing” (or\xa0shinrin-yoku), which involves simply being in nature and experiencing it through our five senses—sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing. Whether you adopt this lovely practice, or find your own way to get outside and pay close attention to the natural world, I expect you’ll\xa0feel less stressedand more content afterwards.    For those of us with limited time, it’s easy to find ways to combine many of these tips into one activity. For example, going on a walk outdoors with a friend and leaving your cell phone behind can check #2, #3, and #4 off the list simultaneously. As a physician, I can tell you that all the pharmaceuticals, all the acupuncture, and all the herbs in the world cannot compare to the health benefits you can achieve if you incorporate these five basic tips for enjoying a wonderful life.

From sandalwood in Hawaii and peyote in Texas, to osha in Colorado and the ginseng of Appalachia, this talk will highlight several medicinal plants that need our engagement. The work of UpS is unique as there is no other organization dedicated to the conservation of at-risk native medicinal plants. As consumers of herbal medicine, we need to understand where our ingredients come from and what factors make a plant at-risk. UpS has partnered with Mountain Rose Herbs on the launch of the new "Forest Grown" program to promote forest farming of traditional herbs in Appalachia. Learn about this effort and how you can become plant savers in these critical times of rapid extinction of native biodiversity and global deforestation. Plants need us, and each of us can make a difference by healing the planet and ourselves. | Guido Masé Aromatics, Bitters, and Tonics: A Simple System to Support Well-being There are thousands of plants that are used for health around the world - the sheer number can seem daunting. But there are simple ways to start using these herbs, in safe and effective ways, to maximize wellness for yourself, your friends, and your family. We will explore three classes of botanicals, learn how inextricably tied they are to our own physiologies, and discover the crucial role they play in maintaining vibrant health: aromatic plants, valued for their effects on mind and spirit; bitter plants, essential for digestive health (and more), and tonic plants, which support immune and cardiovascular function. Together, these allies provide a toolkit to help us navigate the modern world with grace and resilience, and reconnect us to the wild world in which we evolved. | Many of us feel lost and long for a way home to a right relationship with the earth and our plant allies. We seek ways to take our medicine and food into our own hands in ways that honor our connection to all beings and empower us as individuals. In this inspiring lecture, Heron Brae discusses seasonal patterns in relationship to plants, and the inner seasonal rhythms that echo within and around us. Calling attention to these patterns can help us deepen our relationship to the changing energies of nature. In this time of the waning sun of late summer, which plants are vibrant and ready to pick? What ways can we tend and work with plants to support their optimal growth? What are the seasonal patterns that we can learn from through watching and working with our plant allies? She discusses the entire wheel of the year, the many layers of patterns within this model, including plant harvesting and medicinal characteristics. Come away with a map of your personal yearly cycles and the plants that call to us within that cycle.', 'chan_desc': "Ready to devour some inspiring herbal education?

This meditation will begin by assisting you to relax and prepare for sleep. Once relaxed there will be a series of affirmations that you will hear until you are asleep. You can simply listen to the affirmations, or if you would like to in your mind, feel free to repeat them. This is designed to help you drift off to sleep while the affirmations are continuing. You do not need to be awake to benefit from them. Your subconscious will hear them as your own words.Our thoughts and the words we shape them with can influence our bodies ability to heal. Our bodies cells are in constant communication with each other and collectively they hear what we are thinking and saying. Having positive thoughts and using positive words can then create a positive healing environment for our cells to heal. Ultimately, it is always our body that does the healing, we only need to provide the right environment. The answer is always within us.A healing combination: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Meditation written by Les Raymond and read by Sara RaymondPhoto Credit: Clemente Ruiz Abenza from Unsplash.comMusic Credit: (Adrift Delta) by Christopher Lloyd Clarke. https://www.christopherlloydclarke.com.

Victoria Gallagher:\xa0I’ve spent the last over 20 years as a\xa0Hypnotist\xa0and\xa0Law of Attraction success coach. And I’m well known for my hypnotic recordings and\xa0personal development\xa0courses. Recently I became\xa0#1 Best Selling Author of the book Practical Law of Attraction\xa0and I’m also an International Speaker. What is Luck? It is my strong belief that no matter what your background is, no matter where you are standing right now, luck is something that you can create, rather than just having to settle for being an “unlucky” person. Let me begin by making a basic distinction between luck and opportunity. Opportunity is something that is unpredictable; it’s those events that just happen at random in the world. Opportunity (and we’ll use this word synonymously with the word “chance”) is anything that happens unpredictably without discernible human intention or observable cause. Chance encounters, or opportunity, are those things you basically have no control over.\xa0 Opportunities are always available, but you have no control over them becoming available. They can, however, turn into a luck situation, depending on the action that is taken or not taken. It is how you respond to the opportunities in life that determines your luck. You must take a chance for it to become good luck or bad luck. If you do not bend over and pick up that $100 bill lying on the ground, then you passed up an opportunity for good luck. If you didn’t take the opportunity to pick up the phone and ask for an interview for that job which just became available, again, you would have passed up the chance for good luck. You are exposed to a lot of opportunities. If you don’t act upon them, then you are not likely to attract good luck. What is luck? Luck is the ability to take the correct action in an opportunity. If you think that some people are just born lucky, think again. We’re going to go over the many different areas you can work on to increase your probability of luck. It’s scientific. There are many ways to increase your luck. You are going to learn the exact formula to increase your luck. It’s a no-fail system and it will work for you as it has worked for me and countless others.

Jonathon Aslay is a mid-life dating coach with an emphasis on purposeful dating and an author. He studies male behavior. He listens to women and what they want when it comes to love. Most importantly, he is gifted at bridging the gap between the two. He started to see patterns in the things women complained about most, and those that continually baffled men. Over time, he realized that processing information from both sides and combining them with his own dating experiences enabled him to filter out the interpersonal “noise” that often causes people to invest in someone who is wrong for them. In addition to his dating expertise and helping women navigate the dating world, Jonathon Aslay is also a leading figure in the self-love department with his book,\xa0What The Heck Is Self-Love Anyway? which is rated 5 stars and has reached the best-selling ranks on Amazon. We talked about:   The #1 problem Jonathon sees with dating today. The typical warning signs and red flags someone should be aware of before dating. How Jonathon uses the Law of Attraction in his coaching. His book on Self-Love and how important\xa0self-love\xa0is in attracting a successful partner. How you can get really clear on what you want before you\xa0 ever begin the dating process. And much more!

So in this episode, we’re going to talk about:  the different types of drugs that are used and why a doctor will use each one Then, we’re going to talk about step by step the IUI procedure itself and what you should expect. \xa0  I hope to offer some clarity so that it doesn’t seem like a huge mystery. \xa0And the next time you’re in a doctor’s office, you’ll know exactly what they’re talking about. \xa0 Links mentioned: Private Facebook Community | Spotting is a sign of instability of the uterine lining.\xa0 Stability of lining is one of the 10 parameters of a fertile cycle.\xa0 It offers clues for us as to where your energy is stuck.

What’s that? Basically, it is a natural birthing technique without any medication, that uses self-hypnosis techniques to combat fear and pain during labor. The result: you’re not screaming in agony (like the typical birthing scene in films!), you’re not linked up to all those bleeping machines in a brightly lit room with doctors and nurses running around you, and you’re not pumped full of painkiller meds. Instead, birthing becomes a connective, intensely powerful female experience. \xa0 That’s why more and more women are opting out of the traditional hospital birth, and going for natural hypnobirthing instead. Like today’s co-host Laura Petersen (which you know from some of our previous episodes). Laura is a best-selling author and self-publishing coach, and she’s expecting her first child. She’s opted for a natural hospital birth using the Mongan Method. \xa0 Melissa Tucker, podcast host and marketing expert, has one of the most intriguing birth stories we’ve ever heard. After having two children the traditional, hospitalized, way, she was inspired to go natural. For her third child, she chose home hypnobirthing. Without epidurals, without drugs, and without doctors, she used self-hypnosis to keep herself calm, focused and centered. The experience was so magical, she wanted to do it all over again. \xa0 Katherine Maslen is a clinical naturopath, nutritionist, author, and host of the Shift podcast. And she too has an amazing natural birth story. But you’ll have to listen to the episode for the details! \xa0 Here are the best resources if you want to research alternatives to hospital childbirth: \xa0  Watch the Business of Being Born documentary The Birth Education Centre in San Diego Hypnobabies The Mongan Method www.evidencebasedbirth.com Research your doctor and your hospital (some have higher rates of c-sections than others) Listen to Katherine’s podcast The Shift.  \xa0 You can connect with Melissa via her website www.MelissaSueTucker.com.

This sexy, savvy duo provides eco-friendly advice on a variety of issues including the healing power of nutrition, living authentically, turning your passion into your career, choosing the best natural health and beauty products, the benefits of a plant-based diet and so much more! | There exists a single cell organism that contains over 40 different vitamins and minerals, but has only 1 calorie. \xa0 So what is the magical ingredient? Algae. For Catharine Arnston, this food is the gift that keeps on giving. \xa0 Catharine discovered algae it by accident. Ten years ago, her sister got breast cancer. She was lucky enough to have an oncologist who understood the diet connection and told her she needed to go on an alkaline diet. Catharine realized she needed to know more about nutrition, so she studied at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. And she learnt two things: people know they need to eat healthier. And most people don’t have the time to do that. Catharine knew she needed to create something green, healthy, and easy to take to help people improve their health effortlessly. So she turned to the one game-changing ingredient in her sister’s cancer healing diet: algae. \xa0 Did you know algae is endorsed by NASA and the United Nations as the most nutrient-dense food there is? It’s so nutritious, that the US Government has now set up a bill that encourages farmers to cultivate it. \xa0 So, what makes algae so healing? \xa0 Algae can be split into two sub categories. One is seaweed, which is grown in the ocean (like dulse, kelp and nori). It’s packed with fiber and iodine and very nutritious. But not as nutritious as the second category: micro algae. The two most powerful micro algae are spirulina and chlorella. Together, they are a powerhouse for your health. Spirulina is energizing and hunger-satiating, while chlorella is healing. \xa0 Spirulina was the first life on earth, over 4 billion years ago. It’s outlived the ice ages and the dinosaurs… So it’s got to be pretty special! Spirulina is technically a bacteria, which is great for your gut. It’s also the highest protein food (containing 64% protein, in amino-acid form), and because your body doesn’t need to break it down, it gives you instant physical and mental energy. That’s why Catharine calls her spirulina tablets Energy Bits. It also satisfies your hunger, which is great if you’re intermittent fasting. As if that wasn’t enough, studies have found that spirulina helps your hair grow faster, clears up your skin, and helps you lose weight. \xa0 Chlorella developed on earth around a billion years after spirulina. It’s a healing food, it helps your body to recover. Hence the name: Recovery Bits. It has the highest concentration of chlorophyll in the world (yes, even more than wheatgrass). Chlorophyll helps your cells to detox by maintaining the health of the cell wall. This allows nutrients to flow in, and toxins to flow out. Chlorella will also attach to toxins in your body (heavy metals, radiation, lactic acids, alcohol, environmental chemicals, etc.) and help eliminate them. It’s an intelligent food - it knows what to take out and what to leave in. \xa0 Which spirulina and chlorella, you’re looking at two perfect foods for health and healing. Catharine has blended the two together into Vitality Bits, which gives you the best of both algae in an easy-to-take tiny tablet. \xa0 Of course, when you take supplements, you want to make sure they’re absolutely pure. Catharine spent a long time researching the best place to source and grow algae to ensure her products are the purest quality. She gets her algae from Taiwan, which has the highest standards. The algae is grown in triple filtered water and air-dried to preserve all the nutrients. \xa0 You can get 20% off on any product at energybits.com with the code FoodHeals. \xa0 Being hailed as “Sex and the City for Food,” The Food Heals Podcast brings together experts in the field of nutrition, health and healing to teach you the best-kept natural secrets to being a hotter, healthier, happier YOU! \xa0 The Food Heals Podcast is hosted by Allison Melody and Suzy Hardy – two self-proclaimed natural chicks who will rock your world and change your beliefs about health!

For many, the word throws up images of green juices and fasting. But that’s not quite accurate. You might be surprised to learn that you can cleanse in a gentler way. But you also need to go beyond diet if you want to really reset your body. \xa0 Elissa Goodman looks 20 years younger than her age (59), you might think she’s been blessed with great genes. But she was not the healthiest child. She had a low immune system and was always sick. She got every type of virus, digestive issues, tonsillitis, chickenpox, chronic fatigue - you name it, she had it. To make matters worse, she felt unworthy compared to her high-achieving Type A personality parents. \xa0 Fast-forward to adulthood, Elissa went to college, got into advertising, and climbed that corporate ladder because she was determined to make her parents proud. But she wasn’t following her passion or purpose. She just worked. And got sicker. And one day she was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. \xa0 She knew that this was because she’d been sick most of her life and that her lymphatic system was full of toxins that she’d been unable to clear. But she hadn’t thought of the emotional aspect. The doctors she saw first just talked of chemo and freezing her eggs. But one of them was different. He sat her down and asked: Are you happy? Are you doing what you love? It was a turning point. \xa0 Elissa realized how miserable she’d been in her job and how much she disliked herself. She knew something had to change. She went 100% vegan, she started doing yoga, she went into talk therapy, and do emotional release work. She got rid of her cancer, but the radiation caused hypothyroidism. Then she was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s and celiac (two autoimmune conditions). And then her husband died of cancer. It was like a cascade of traumatic life events. That’s when she decided to go back to school and learn about nutrition so she could help her daughters stay healthy. \xa0 And that was it - she never looked back. She became a cleanse expert to help as many people as possible get healthy the easy way. Like her 1-week soup cleanse, which contains 45 different vegetables, is totally vegan and free from anything processed or GMO. She helps her clients to reset their body and brain so they can rejuvenate, re-energize, heal, and maintain a new, healthy lifestyle long-term. \xa0 Here are some of Elissa’s tips to reset your body:  Juicing - a fantastic way to get all those vitamins straight into your cells Smoothies - packed with healthy fiber which helps cleanse your digestive system Vegetables, vegetables, vegetables - the more the better (especially dandelion greens, cruciferous veg, and celery) Take a good quality superfood powder (Elissa loves Pure Synergy Juice Powder)  \xa0 Cleansing is so important because it also allows you to step away from addictive foods so that you can crave healthy, whole, plant foods. However, cleansing is emotional as well as nutritional. \xa0 Have you dealt with your trauma? Because no matter how clean your diet, you can still get sick if you have emotional issues you haven’t dealt with. Here are Elissa’s tips to start letting go of those trauma toxins: \xa0  Find a good energy healer - you hold a lot of negative energy (toxins) in your cells (Get in touch with Elissa if you’d like to know who she has worked with). Identify what trauma you experienced in your first 7 years. Ask yourself whether you’re truly happy with your career / partner / friends / family. Check out books like Mind over Medicine and Radical Remission to learn how to release trauma. Try a meditation app like Unplug. Journal about what you want to let go - first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Cultivate self-love - that is one thing that’s missing from most of our lives. Send love to your inner child. Go to Elissa’s website to join her cleanse programs!

For that same reason, we’re unable to find a loving partner.

You’re taking in your surroundings, you’re noticing the person you’re talking to, you’re breathing, you’re digesting, you’re walking…. Not to mention dealing with the millions of emails, texts and social media messages! No wonder your brain is exhausted! Nootropics help it to work better, to think clearer, and in the long-term protect it from damage. Josh swears by supplements from Neurohacker Collective. \xa0 Manifesting the one: Who do you want in your life? A “whatever you want, baby” kind of partner, or someone who challenges you? And how do you find love in this world of Tinder and nobody having any time? After three years of being single, Josh manifested his new relationship. He was on Paul Chek’s podcast, and Paul gave him a divine union prayer to practice. “Bless me that I choose my life’s companion according to the laws of perfect soul union.” Nine days later, in the desert, Josh met Kerry Michelle on Cathedral Rock. He knew right away that they had a deep soul connection. It’s not just the prayer, of course. It’s knowing that you are in the right space for a relationship - knowing yourself and understanding that everything that has happened in your life has happened for your growth. It’s a journey towards self-love - because when you can connect with self-love, then you can call in your soulmate. The more you are in the energy of love, the more love you will attract into your life. \xa0 Forgiveness: You know when you’re holding on to the pain that someone else caused you, and you’re stuck in victim mode, and you just can’t forgive them? We’ve all been there. But who are you hurting, ultimately? Only yourself. That feeling of anger towards another is a toxic emotion, and it can take over your life because of the negative beliefs that you unconsciously hold on to. Not only that, but you’re probably also beating yourself up about the fact you’re not being a forgiving person. Right? Double whammy. It was at a Rythmia plant medicine ceremony that Josh realized he’d spent twenty years holding on to anger at his father and believing he couldn’t trust men. By forgiving him, and then forgiving himself for having held on to that anger in the first place, Josh was able to release the emotion that was holding him back. You can too. \xa0 What’s 5G doing to us? Believe it or not, within the Terms & Conditions of your phone, there’s a statement that says you should never have your phone physically touching you. When the phone touches your body, it transfers the 5G into your DNA. So it’s important to keep your phone in your bag, not in your pocket. The less you have your phone touch your skin, the less the 5G will affect your body. Turn off your WiFi at night (you can buy a timer from Amazon). Put your phone on airplane mode if you’re carrying your phone in your pocket.

If you look at our world right now, it seems obvious that we are living too much in fear. And we need to move to love if we want to heal - not just ourselves, but the whole world. \xa0 It took Josh Trent a long time to get to that place. \xa0 He had a rough childhood. He was a premature baby and spent the first two weeks of his life in an incubator. His dad left when he was 2 months old. His mum was bipolar. He never felt safe or peaceful at home. Without any parental presence, Josh didn’t learn how to deal with his emotions. So he found a drug. And that drug was food. It became a way to numb the feelings he didn’t know what to do with. \xa0 At 21 years old Josh weighed 280 pounds; he was in a loveless relationship and working a job he hated. It was the perfect moment for an awakening - there just HAD to be more to life than this. His journey began with losing weight. He spent 18 months frantically trying all the diets. But he was trying too hard to get out of feeling bad… instead of taking action from a place of trust and self-love. It wasn’t working. So at just 24, he sold everything and moved to Hawaii to study nutrition, to work out, and to spend time with himself - to just be. He became a personal trainer to help people lose weight and transform their lives. The thing is… he knew fitness wasn’t “it.” \xa0 So he went back to a corporate job selling technology software. It was spiritual suicide. And then he got fired. Suddenly, he felt liberated. He had something to share. After all, our biggest struggles are the biggest gift we can give the world. He decided to launch Wellness Force and started his podcast, Wellness Force Radio, which is now a top-ranked wellness show. \xa0 But it was plant-medicine which really took Josh to a place of healing, and a place from which he could follow his passion. The first time he drank ayahuasca, he felt an intense, all-consuming, nurturing, loving feminine energy. The energy of the Mother Gaia, Mother Earth. \xa0 Ayahuasca is an ancient medicine - it was used over 5000 years ago. When you drink it, you go into an altered state. And from that place, you can let go of addiction. Any addiction - food, drugs, work, shopping - covers our wounds but doesn’t heal them. To heal it, we need to face the pain. Plant medicine takes you to the source of pain, and lets it out. Yes, it’s a drug. But so is coffee. So are opioid painkillers. Ayahuasca is not addictive. And it is even being scientifically studied because of its power to reconnect both brain hemispheres and trigger long-lasting emotional healing. \xa0 Why do we need this? Because we’re killing the world right now. And the way we’re treating our earth and our environment, it all comes back to us. When we eat animals that have been tortured, we’re absorbing the fear that animal felt, the pharmaceuticals it was fed. Mother Earth is giving these plants to us to teach us how to heal ourselves and our world. \xa0 To begin healing, you don’t have to dive straight into plant medicine. Breathwork is another ancient tool to get to an altered state. It gets you out of your head and into your body, where trauma can come out. The following two practices are easy to do quickly on your own. \xa0 Phase 1 Sit with your knees below your hips (on a meditation cushion). Align your head, shoulders and hips. Take a deep clearing breath, filling in your belly first and then your chest. Take 21 forceful breaths. Do a few rounds of box breath - 5 second inhale, hold for 5 and feel your belly expand, breathe out for 5 seconds, then breathe out all your air out and feel your stomach contract. \xa0 Phase 2 This is also known as performance breathing. Breathing in quickly through your nose turns on your stress response and makes you more aware of your surroundings. Breathe in quickly for 2 seconds. Then hold for 7 seconds - this activates your vagus nerve and gets you into rest mode. Then breath out for 8 seconds. This activates the parasympathetic nervous system into healing. \xa0 Want to get started doing breathwork? Then go to www.wellnessforce.com/M21 to download Josh’s guide and take part in the 7-day breathwork challenge. Plus you’ll discover other practices that will help you transform your morning, let go of old weight, and heal your life. \xa0 Being hailed as “Sex and the City for Food,” The Food Heals Podcast brings together experts in the field of nutrition, health and healing to teach you the best-kept natural secrets to being a hotter, healthier, happier YOU! \xa0 The Food Heals Podcast is hosted by Allison Melody and Suzy Hardy – two self-proclaimed natural chicks who will rock your world and change your beliefs about health!

We all want to be perfect. Why? Because we’ve been sold the idea that we need to be perfect to be acceptable. This is especially true when it comes to our skin. It has to be pore-less, flawless, smooth, wrinkle-free - that’s a lot to worry about. We’re all trying to fit into some standardized idea of beauty… a standard created by marketing experts to sell us products and services! \xa0 Daisy’s quest for perfection started in the 3rd grade. As her acne developed, she was determined to get rid of it and make her skin perfect. She visited dozens of dermatologists, tried hundreds of “miracle” products, antibiotics, benzo-peroxide skincare… nothing worked. In fact, many of these products made the acne worse. Check out  Episode 220 for her healing story. \xa0 This struggle with perfection is what motivated Daisy to start her own all-natural skincare brand, Banish, that removes acne scars and is gentle on skin. But more importantly, Daisy went on a journey to let go of the need to be perfect. \xa0 After all, what is perfectionism? Isn’t it just a symptom of feeling that you’re not good enough? It’s a control issue. Trying to control how you appear to others, hiding your “flaws” so that you become acceptable. This is crazy. Each of us is uniquely beautiful, we all have a light to share. \xa0 So how do you let go of the need to be perfect? For Daisy, it was focusing on something bigger than herself. As she focused on her YouTube channel, offering advice, sharing her struggles and responding to viewers, her focus shifted from appearance-obsession to helping others. This changed everything. \xa0 If you want to be comfortable in your skin, you’ve got to get outside your head. After all, what do you notice about other people? Do you notice their wrinkles and pimples, or do you notice their friendly smile, cool outfit, positive attitude? \xa0 Beyond Your Skin You’re not defined by your looks. You’re defined by the difference you make in other people’s lives. So, what can you do? Give back. Volunteer at a homeless shelter, organize a campaign, do a clean-up, get involved helping your community, help those in your immediate circle who are struggling, make their life a bit better. Your journey is your gift to the world, any struggles you’ve gone through are ways you can help others. \xa0 Acne goes deeper than your skin Your skin is your biggest organ, and it tells you whether something is off. Acne is a sign of a deeper issue - unbalanced hormones, inflammation, poor gut health. Skincare is only 20% of the solution. You need to start from the inside. Going vegan, quitting junk foods, giving up dairy can all help. Once you’ve got your diet sorted out, then you can look at skincare. \xa0 A natural way to clearer skin The latest Banish product, Banisher 2.0, will help you on your journey to becoming comfortable in your skin. It’s a patented device with 24 carat plated tiny needles, that prick the skin and force it to heal by producing more collagen and elastin (known as micro-needling). Combined with Banish oil (made fresh every day with ascorbic acid - the most potent form of vitamin C), it accelerates the healing and rejuvenating process. You’ll get a glow from the first day.

By the time she was a teenager, she was sitting on the side of the road trying to raise awareness of the plight of factory farmed animals. \xa0 Her struggle with perfectionism really began in her early twenties. She was working in the fitness industry, and she decided that the way to promote the vegan lifestyle was to be so perfect, so lean, so muscular, that people would want to find out how she got there. \xa0 Unfortunately, this made life impossible. When Ella looked in the mirror, all she saw was her flaws. Her quest for a perfect body led her down a dark path of unhealthy behaviors like extreme calorie counting and binging. On the outside, she was a picture of vegan health, but behind closed doors, Ella saw herself as fat and restricted her food. Because all her focus was on something else - helping animals - Ella disconnected with herself. \xa0 Isn’t that what so many of us do these days? We’re taking care of everyone else, too busy with our children, our families, our work… and we neglect to work on ourselves, to cultivate that self-acceptance that helps us to live a joyful, purposeful life, that helps us be the best version of ourselves, and, ultimately, helps us make a bigger positive impact on the world. \xa0 In the digital age we live in now, we’re constantly comparing ourselves to other people - or profiles. How can we get over that? How can we know that we are fine just as we are? Well a good place to start is to say: I am perfectly imperfect. Because that’s what we all are. \xa0 We need to reprogram ourselves to get us out of that mental space of “I’m not good enough”. The first step is to acknowledge it. \xa0  Get into observation mode - pause and figure out the thoughts that are making you feel like crap. Use affirmations to change those thoughts from negative to positive. Reconnect with gratitude for your body. Be patient - it will take time. Share - you don’t have to do it alone. Connect with like-minded women to find that support. Start with the emotional aspect first, be gentle with yourself. Approach yourself with curiosity and compassion (instead of judgement). Check out Ella’s Self-Empowerment Coaching System - a structured program for really looking at where you are right now, taking your power back, and falling in love with you.  \xa0 Just focusing on the food or the workouts will only work for a short time. Unless you tackle the root cause of why you’re where you are right now, change will not last. And the root is how you view yourself. Whether you love yourself or not. Self-love is the pre-requisite for making sustainable changes in your life. \xa0 Through nutrition, veganism, muay thai boxing and self-love practices, Ella came out of the darkness of disordered eating, and now leads a body-positive life. She runs the Plant Empowered Coaching program where she helps her tribe adopt a vegan lifestyle and love the skin they’re in - without counting calories or feeling restricted.

So, we’ve asked three successful entrepreneurs to share their top tips to banish limiting beliefs and step into your dream life. \xa0 Lisa Thomas - a transformational energy healer, Lisa empowers her clients to reach their full potential by removing inherited emotional blocks. One of the blocks so many of us carry concerns money. How many times have we heard “Money doesn’t grow on trees” or “You can’t be spiritual and prosperous” or “There is never enough”? Of course this impacts how we view money, and our own prosperity. \xa0 How can we transform our money mindset and manifest from a place of gratitude? \xa0 Inherited money beliefs are huge, and they’re based around scarcity - there not being enough to go around or that what you have will be taken from you. The antidote? Gratitude. \xa0 So, how do you tap into that?  Start small. “I am grateful that I’m alive.” Or you might be grateful that you have a bed, that the sun is out, that you have a roof over your head. Before you know it, your vibration will start rising. Make sure you speak it out loud. When you speak it, it sends it out into the universe. And when you give gratitude, it comes back. Give gratitude for what you know is coming - your high-vibe clients, your perfect home, your ideal partner… What if a negative belief creeps in? That’s fear. It’s time for stronger statements like “My life is getting better, whether I believe it or not” Check out Episode 215 for the full episode, where Lisa talks to Alli and vegan entrepreneur Whitney Lauritsen about releasing inherited emotional blocks and manifesting all you desire.

He’s also co-produced the film Think and Grow Rich - The Legacy. His mission is to help people take ownership of their financial, physical and mental health. Check out Episode 205 for his inspirational money story. \xa0 How can we all think and grow rich? We need to address our entire life, because money, body, and mind are all linked. \xa0  If you want to have a good relationship at home, you need to be engaged with your finances. Write out a goals list (financial goals, health goals, life goals etc.), and get your spouse do to the same - this way you can know what’s important to them now, and in the future, and work together to make it happen.\xa0 Get very clear on what you want. It’s much easier to take the first step if you know your destination. That will spur you on to greater success. Keep it simple, and consistent. Get out of victim mentality and banish limiting beliefs:   Look forward instead of focusing on the past. Get crystal clear on where you want to be - mentally, physically and financially. What is your environment like? Are you hanging out with too many negative people? Get comfortable with being out of your comfort zone. Try  journaling - it helps you start the day with intention, purpose and passion.    \xa0 \xa0 Alida McDaniel helps people across the globe tap into pure consciousness and shift the world one thought at the time. If you want banish those negative beliefs, and create more time in our day for positive action, you need to break out of fear. How? By setting intentions. \xa0  Give yourself permission to be fearless.

It was 2008. She was living a sheltered life - married to her childhood sweetheart, children, a family home. And one day she saw a text on her husband’s phone that revealed he had been having an affair. Her world blew up instantaneously. The life she knew ended in 5 minutes. One minute they were sitting down to dinner, the next minute she’d thrown him out. Three days later they filed for divorce. She hit rock bottom. \xa0 But often the toughest times are those we need the most, even though it might not feel like it in the moment. Her divorce was the catalyst for a new beginning. Sarah began to realize she had the freedom to invent who she wanted to be. She started making a future board - finding pictures that illustrated the life she wanted to experience, and daydreaming about it. And the magic happened. Because when you shift your focus from what you’ve gone through in the past, or are going through in the moment, to what you want to create, you make your dreams happen. Before she knew it, she’d manifested 95% of what she wanted. \xa0 Now, Sarah is a master coach who has worked with professional athletes and people across the world. She’s a workshop leader, keynote speaker and best-selling author. She’s living her best life, and helping people manifest their dreams. \xa0 Her latest book FutureBoards is a step by step guide to using vision boards to manifest your dream life, and is out TODAY! It’s available at Target, and if you take a photo of you with the book, post it and tag @SarahCentrella with the hashtag #futureboards, you could win free coaching, free courses, and autographed books. \xa0 \xa0 How to use a vision board:   Define what you really want. Find pictures that match what’s in your head. Put yourself in your dreams in your mind. Hang your vision board in your space so that you can spend time around it. Get comfortable with your dreams, no matter how big they are.  \xa0 Being hailed as “Sex and the City for Food,” The Food Heals Podcast brings together experts in the field of nutrition, health and healing to teach you the best-kept natural secrets to being a hotter, healthier, happier YOU! \xa0 The Food Heals Podcast is hosted by Allison Melody and Suzy Hardy – two self-proclaimed natural chicks who will rock your world and change your beliefs about health!

Can shifting the lipid makeup of the skin have impacts down the road? If you are on accutane, what should you keep in mind? Long-term use of isotretinoin Why are antibiotics used to treat skin issues?  Quotes "We\'ve been doing research on isotretinoin. It does shift the way your fats and lipids on the skin are being expressed. And in doing so, it shifts the inflammatory profile on the skin, and, in fact, it will shift the microbiome."

[23:13] Links Find Dr. Sivamani online Dermveda | Can biotin -- one of the most common supplements used for your skin, hair and nails -- mess up your labs? Yep. It’s actually pretty alarming how many labs will be skewed from biotin supplementation. In today’s episode, I’m sharing the details on how much biotin can cause a problem, which tests can be majorly messed up, and what you can do to prevent biotin from skewing your labs. This way, you can better advocate for yourself and ensure that your labs come back accurate. In this episode:  Why there is a Biotin Warning issued by the FDA How biotin supplementation can lead to misdiagnosis Labs that biotin specifically messes up Can biotin affect thyroid labs? How to get around biotin skewing lab data  Quotes: Testing for heart issues can be skewed for possible Heart failure or a Heart attack. One specific issue has to do with testing for the protein troponin to identify whether a complaint of chest pain is a heart attack or GERD (heartburn). The next one that\'s a pretty big deal for most of my clients would be their thyroid hormones. If you’ve ever wondered can biotin affect thyroid labs, the answer is YES. Biotin supplementation can skew thyroid hormone results to the point where your doctor could even misdiagnose you with something like Graves\' disease. Other tests that can be affected include those for pregnancy, cancer, vitamin D, and even iron deficiency anemia. The FDA issued a warning about this very specific problem with biotin that can skew your labs. Even small doses of 5 to 10 milligrams is enough to potentially skew the labs. | Stealth infections (such as mold) are often overlooked in the treatment of chronic skin issues, both in conventional and functional medicine.

My guest today is Dr. Jess Peatross, a visionary for the future of healthcare. She is an expert in the field of stealth infections and infectious disease, biologics and regenerative medicine, cannabis, ozone and environmental toxicities. \xa0 Dr. Jess is a board certified internal medicine physician who trained at the University of Louisville. During this time, Dr. Jess experienced what many of her patients today are suffering from: anxiety, hormonal imbalances and adrenal dysfunction. She began to seek out real answers that got to the root cause of disease, not just for herself, but for her patients as well. After realizing that allopathic medicine was not the perfect fit for chronic disease solutions, Dr. Jess trained in the realm of functional medicine, Gerson therapy, ozone and nutrigenomics. Her philosophy now embodies true health as being all encompassing of mind, body and spirit, which is true health. What she has learned, and wants to share with the world, is that our bodies are perfect. Ninety percent of disease comes from lifestyle, diet and environment, which is what ultimately changes our genes, so everyone does have a chance to HEAL and reverse chronic disease. Join us as we talk about how mold and other stealth infections can trigger chronic skin rashes. Have your skin conditions improved after addressing mold and stealth infections? Tell me about it in the comments! In this episode:  Stealth infections and how they affected Dr. Jess\'s significant other Mold and mold infections How to figure out if you have a mold infection Why are nasal swabs useful? Why real healing isn\'t typically a pleasant experience Why eliminating more and more food isn\'t the answer  Quotes "Candida is unicellular. Mold is multicellular. So they behave in a very similar fashion with similar symptoms a lot of the time." [6:25] "There\'s one out of four people in the population who have a genetic predisposition to being very sensitive to mold. And if they\'re in a chronic exposure, they can\'t get rid of it—even after they\'re out of the exposure—without help." [7:02] "When your body sees things that it\'s missed (or that have gone under the radar), it\'s really going to go into kill mode temporarily—because that pathogen that it missed is not supposed to be in your body." [11:48] "A lot of rashes are the body pushing out something that it\'s viewing as foreign or a threat somehow to the body." [13:23] "Your genes load the gun, the environment pulls the trigger." [14:32] "I firmly believe that disease comes from four places: hidden infections, heavy metals, other environmental toxicities, and emotional trauma and stress."

Today I want to share with you five things that you MUST KNOW that could help give you chronic skin rash relief. If you’re looking to dig deeper, make sure to dive into the bigger conversation over in the\xa0Eczema & Psoriasis Awareness Week 2019. In this episode:  Complicated role that estrogen and progesterone play in triggering skin rashes Endotoxemia that triggers internal inflammation driving rashes Could CBD help reduce your need for steroid creams? Instances where Molybdenum could be helpful for skin rashes Mold and mycotoxins: Hidden triggers for complex skin cases  Quotes: Estrogen dominance is where you just have way too much estrogen floating around your system for different reasons. Sometimes it\'s because estrogen cannot be cleared out of your system (due to underlying gut problems). The problem is that high estrogen decrease histamine breakdown and that can drive very itchy skin. | Hormones play a significant role in skin health. Imbalanced hormones can manifest on our skin in the form of cystic acne, eczema flares, psoriasis flares, and more. My guest today will explain how hormones (particularly sex hormones) impact skin conditions. My guest today is Dr. Carrie Jones, an internationally recognized speaker, consultant, and educator on the topic of women’s health and hormones. Dr. Carrie graduated from the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM), School of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon where she also completed her 2-year residency in women’s health, hormones and endocrinology. Later, she graduated from Grand Canyon University’s Master of Public Health program with a goal of doing more international education. She was adjunct faculty for many years teaching gynecology and advanced endocrinology/fertility and has been the Medical Director for 2 large integrative clinics in Portland. Dr. Carrie is the Medical Director for Precision Analytical, Inc, creators of the DUTCH hormone test.

Skin issues during perimenopause and menopause Diet and skin Supplement information Why balanced estrogen is important (not too much, not too little) The impact of cortisol on the skin How a DUTCH test differs from a blood test  Quotes "Building lean muscle mass will actually help you reduce your insulin." [10:35] "There\'s a part of green tea called the EGCG. It\'s a pretty potent antioxidant but it\'s really helpful in shifting testosterone away from the acne pathway." [10:51] "That high estrogen rise is what triggers us to ovulate and help get us pregnant (if that\'s what you\'re trying to do). But for some women, that high rise in estrogen will trigger her skin stuff." [12:54] "Melatonin is an actual hormone. Vitamin D is a hormone. Progesterone is a hormone. DHEA is a hormone. And so even though it\'s over the counter, it\'s still a hormone and you can really mess yourself up if you just self-prescribe."

Healthy Skin Show ep. 043: Candida and Skin Rashes: A Hidden Root Cause Healthy Skin Show ep. 006: How To Tweak Your Diet To Combat Candida w/ Ricki Heller | As you probably know by now, your skin is VERY nutrient hungry. Deficiencies can be a root cause helping to drive dysfunction in your skin as well as skin rash flares. It usually comes as a shock when clients who eat a really fabulous whole foods based diet discover that they are nutrient depleted. There are a number of reasons why and I figured that I’d take a moment to answer one of the most common questions I’m asked by nearly every single client -- “how could this have happened if I’ve been doing everything right?” In this episode:  How you can end up with nutrient deficiencies even when you’re doing everything right with your diet What percentage of skin rash clients have nutrient deficiencies 4 reasons why you can end up with nutrient deficiencies Simple steps to take to figure out if you have deficiencies  Quotes: It\'s not uncommon for labs to appear within the normal range or for your doctor to not test thoroughly enough. But what might shock you the most is that 100% of my clients all have nutrient deficiencies. Obviously the deficiencies vary from person to person, but what is similar is this sense of shock especially when they’ve been eating so well for a long period of time. They thought they were doing everything right only to discover that the nutrition wasn’t getting absorbed. Despite what most of us think, your body does not make every nutrient that it needs to thrive. Most nutrients critical to life and your body’s biochemistry (especially what supports healthy skin) must be taken in from food unless you’re supplementing. Poor food quality obviously has a negative impact on your nutrient levels because there are certain levels of specific nutrients that your body requires daily. That’s why periods of low nutrient intake deplete the stores and put you at a deficit. | Chronic skin rashes are frustrating at any age, but they\'re particularly heartbreaking to see in young children. My guest today has some incredible tips to share about preventing and treating eczema (and itchy skin in general) in children. My guest today is Dr. Elisa Song, MD. She is a holistic pediatrician, pediatric functional medicine expert, and mama to two crazy fun kids. In her integrative pediatric practice, Whole Family Wellness, she’s helped thousands of kids get to the root causes of their health concerns and helped their parents understand how to help their children thrive – body, mind, and spirit – by integrating conventional pediatrics with functional medicine, homeopathy, acupuncture, herbal medicine, and essential oils.

Because I’ve mentioned before that there are\xa016 root causes of chronic skin rash conditions\xa0like psoriasis,\xa0what I’m about to share with you pretty mind-blowing! I stumbled across a\xa0paper in a major dermatology journal\xa0that details some really incredible information that in many respects flies in the face of how we currently address psoriasis. The question that I’m left with is…\xa0why isn’t this making its way down to the doctor’s office? If you’ve only been told that psoriasis is a skin problem, get ready to have that notion completely flipped on its head! In this episode:  Ground-breaking paper discussion by Dr. P. Haines Ely published in 2018 Many connections between psoriasis and gut problems Why poor protein breakdown (from your diet) could be a major factor Gut infections commonly found in psoriasis Hidden trigger for itchy psoriatic lesions Ties between Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Psoriasis  Quotes: Polyamines are byproducts of protein purification. Their high levels present in psoriatic skin means that you aren’t properly breaking down and absorbing dietary protein and ultimately allows your microbiome to ferment them. And then we’re shockingly seeing these polyamines out in the skin of those with psoriasis. If you’ve ever wondered — is psoriasis caused by a leaky gut? The answer is YES. He then goes on to state that “Recent data confirms the presence of gut-derived bacterial DNA in psoriatic blood. The species identified included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae…” | Some vitamins and minerals have a key role to play in our skin health. Unfortunately, many of us are either slightly or very deficient in these nutrients, which can cause symptoms to manifest on our skin. My guest today is Chris Masterjohn, PhD. Chris earned his PhD in Nutritional Sciences from the University of Connecticut in the summer of 2012. He served as a postdoctoral research associate in the Comparative Biosciences department of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and as Assistant Professor of Health and Nutrition Sciences at Brooklyn College, part of the City University of New York.

[6:51] "In addition to making the [skin] surfaces smooth and not over keratinized, vitamin A is also playing a critical role in the immune system.

Stress is\xa0one of the 16 root causes\xa0I’ve talked about before that can drive and worsen skin rash conditions. You might not be able to cut everything that stresses you out from your life. But you can do something about the stresses that you can’t necessarily control. And the way that you can do that means paying attention to and tapping into the power of your breath (believe it or not). All in the name of some of the fastest, cheapest, and best stress relief out there. I share this with my private clients and so I thought in today’s episode, I’d share this with you! In this episode:  What to do if you can’t eliminate stress in your life Connection between stress levels and how you breath Jennifer’s top 3 breathing exercises that can drop stress levels in 2 minutes or less Tips for practicing breathing exercises (especially if you’re a newbie) Best way to integrate a breathing exercise into your daily routine  Quotes: A shallow breath is equated with an increase in anxiety and stress. So when you’re all stressed out and panicked or feeling really upset or distressed, someone will say, take a deep breath. The reason is that as your stress levels rise, your body will respond by taking shorter and shallower breaths that only fill the upper portion of the lungs. But when you take long, deep breaths, it signals to your mind that you are safe and that everything is okay. Here’s the thing about stressors…Part of the process to decreasing your stress exposure is to untether yourself from people and experiences that pile on the stress. But it might not be possible to eliminate everything that creates anxiety and overwhelm. Think of it like those thunderstorms that pop up in the middle of the afternoon that you can\'t control. You just have to run for cover and wait it out. My point is that while you can’t stop a thunderstorm from rolling in, you do have the power to control how you react to it.', 'chan_desc': "Fed up with those skin rashes that just won't go away?

In my field of work, co-dependency shows up a lot. I have this client, whom we’ll call Melissa (though that is not her real name), who was really struggling and by the time she came to me, she was diagnosed with six different clinical diagnoses. And her mom was someone that many would consider overbearing or a co-dependent. Whenever Melissa would come into my clinic to visit me, her mother would bombard her with constant calls, updates, and emails. \xa0 But, the thing is, I don’t think Melissa’s mom was ‘a co-dependent’; I think she was acting co-dependently. Whether this is semantic to you or you have been that family member who has been called co-dependent, I highly recommend that you stay tuned in for this one as we dive deeper into what it means to be co-dependent, why these behavioral patterns exist at all, and how we can help others to overcome and move past this co-dependent behaviors and mindset. \xa0 Topics Discussed: [:42] About today’s topic: co-dependency, and a story about a client of mine. [2:35] More about this term, ‘co-dependent.’ [3:22] My perspective on Melissa’s ‘co-dependent’ mom. [3:51] The three components I’m going to break down in this episode (on co-dependency): what does it even mean to say somebody is co-dependent? Why do these behavioral patterns exist? And how do we help others overcome and get past these co-dependent behaviors? [4:10] How co-dependency is defined and how it first came about. [9:40] Why do these co-dependency behavioral patterns exist? [13:24] How we “cured” Melissa’s mom of her co-dependent behaviors, and why it is incredibly important that we keep it sub-clinical rather than a full-on, clinical disorder. [15:55] How do we measure dysfunction in a couple or a pair of people where this co-dependent pattern of behavior works well for them? [17:04] In Melissa’s and her mother’s story, did co-dependency actually end up serving them? [18:49] What is important to know if you’re struggling or you know someone who is struggling.

Bullying is a serious topic and we have a ton of interviews lined up to take a look at it from all sorts of angles — from what makes a bully, why the bullied take on a defensive role, to the experiences each side experiences. \xa0 A lot of the times what happens with someone who takes on the bully role is that the people they are surrounded by don’t see them as who they could be but instead see them as some small element of who they are right now — and they become trapped. When someone is around people who are constantly pointing out a particular weakness to them, they start believing it too. And as our guest today, Jodie Patterson, says, “The world is unkind to people it doesn’t understand.” \xa0 Jodie Patterson is a mother of five, an activist, an author, and a speaker. As an active LGBTQAI advocate, her activism has been recognized by the likes of Hillary Clinton, GLAAD, Family Circle magazine, Cosmopolitan magazine, Yahoo, Refinery29, and numerous other outlets. She also holds the position of Board Director with the Human Rights Campaign and works closely with HRC’s Parents for Transgender Equality Council. \xa0 In today’s episode, Jodie brings an incredible story about her son who was born biologically female. At just the age of three, he was able to articulate to her that he was not a girl. But before this moment, he often lashed out and was misunderstood because he was misunderstood. Jodie breaks down the notion that “Bullies are bullies because they are bullied,” explains the importance of encouraging your children to do what they love regardless of the labels the world may put on them, and what having “family values” actually means. We also share some of our own experiences with our children around the themes of bullying, labels, and embracing ‘weird.’ \xa0 “Having children is the fastest and most direct way to understanding yourself. Through my kids, I’m able to see my flaws and my strengths, and ultimately get closer to my true and most beautiful spirit. There’s no hiding with kids. They force you to either succumb or rise above.” — Jodie Patterson \xa0 Topics Discussed: [:29] About today’s episode. [:59] Reading our review of the week. [1:36] Sophie reads a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson and we talk about how it relates to bullying. [6:10] We need to believe in ourselves in order to become who we want to be and taking space from others in order to grow. [9:55] More about today’s episode and how this topic deeply relates to our conversation today with, Jodie Patterson. [13:53] We’d love your feedback on this episode! Leave a review or tag us on social media and let us know what resonated with you. [14:20] About our IGNTD Glow Event! [18:26] The conversation portion of our podcast! [18:45] Reading an important quote from Jodie. [19:15] Jodie shares an important story that really illustrates this idea that we need to grow with our children. [23:50] How language minimizes the human experience and how we constantly have to redefine our understanding around words and labels. [25:38] Jodie explains discovering the flexibility of language and thought with her trans son. [28:00] Speaking about the negative affect from the constraints of labels and how this deeply impacted Jodie’s trans son for the first three years of his life. [32:22] Why Jodie’s son was a bully in a world that didn’t understand him. [32:25] Breaking down the notion that “Bullies are bullies because they are bullied,” and exploring why it isn’t always the case. [38:38] The importance of encouraging your children to do what they love and are interested in — regardless of societal norms. [43:00] Why “Weird is good!” [44:47] Sharing our own experience with our son, Leo, bullying others. [47:00] What changed after Jodie’s son vocalized that he was in fact a boy, not a girl? What did she do to help him find his place in the world? [50:45] Jodie gives her advice for trans children as well as their family and parents. [52:31] Talking about or journeys as parents and adjusting for our children. [56:33] The importance of diversifying the people you surround yourself with to broaden your language and experience. [1:00:00] Talking about bullying in today’s society, the concept of “othering,” and Jodie's approach: “mothering: a social architecture.” [1:02:45] What does having “family values” actually mean for your family? [1:09:25] What is the best advice Jodie has ever received? [1:12:02] What has been Jodie’s proudest moment to-date? [1:14:06] What has been Jodie’s most difficult moment to-date?

And What to do About It” and give those of you who are interested or thinking about joining, a small glimpse into the kind of conversation we’re going to be having. \xa0 We’ll be taking a look at the origin of the terms ‘alcoholic’ and ‘addict,’ how the power of belief changes the way you think (and how others around you think about you) from the definitions of these terms, what happens when we stick to the existing beliefs around these labels and ignore our individual differences, and of course, how we can begin to break free from these labels and find our own path to recovery. \xa0 Topics Discussed: [:46] About my upcoming workshop, “Are You Really an Alcoholic? And What to do About It” [1:30] Why I decided to do this workshop (and episode). [4:22] Where do the terms ‘alcoholic’ and ‘addict’ even come from?

This month is truly about opening up your eyes, ears, and hearts to different ways to heal because there is not a one-size-fits-all recovery journey for those struggling with addiction. It’s also incredibly important to remember that addiction is not a standalone thing; addiction comes out as a way to deal with a deeper, underlying issue that needs to be resolved in order to begin to truly recover. \xa0 In this episode, we’re going to be taking a deep look into my own journey with recovery and take a look at some important aspects I’ve never discussed before. I tell you about what my life looked like; peak addiction, my experience in rehab, when my recovery truly started and the mindset shift that took place, what helped me immensely in my recovery, and where I am today with all of it. \xa0 Topics Discussed: [:35] About today’s episode. [5:10] Why we need to stop measuring success in recovery through abstinence. [9:40] The power behind radical transparency.

[27:44] What my life looked like when I was deep into my meth addiction. [31:53] ‘The beginning of the end’: my motorcycle accident, getting arrested, going to jail, and going through withdrawal. [41:52] My experience in rehab and why it ultimately didn’t work for me. [46:50] Getting kicked out of rehab, becoming homeless, and finally coming clean to my dad about my addiction. [50:14] When my recovery truly started: taking ownership. [56:25] When we first met, going to court, and how the judge gave me the opportunity to change my life. [1:01:35] What helped me immensely in my recovery, especially following the worst of my addiction. [1:05:04] What my current boundaries with substances are. [1:07:07] Explaining neuroplasticity.

If you’ve been listening to the podcast long enough, you all know my stance on recovery and that it’s is not really about abstaining, but instead about creating a different reality for yourself and changing the circumstances of your life. But what does it look like to recover? And to do it well? \xa0 Today I’m going to be presenting the topic of what recover looks like and how to improve your life through the lens of what it is that we did to create the IGNTD Glow Event. This event will help not only those in recovery but anyone in their life journey, in figuring out how to become a better person and continuously improve upon yourself. We found, through setting up this event, that these four major categories are the most critical in allowing people to be their best selves: movement, mindfulness, inspiration, and education. Through these four areas, you can become more than you are right now. \xa0 Tune in to this episode to learn more about what real recovery looks like, about this transformational event, and what you can do to better yourself with a supportive community! \xa0 Topics Discussed: [:42] About today’s episode.

He is a professional speaker, teacher, and coach leading classes, workshops and seminars all across the world. Donny is also an ambassador for lululemon and works directly on their Mindfulosphy Team as both a yoga/meditation teacher and personal development coach. In addition to that, he is also the official yoga instructor for the Phoenix Suns and educates other professional athletes in the ways of yoga and mindfulness. \xa0 What’s really interesting about Donny too, is that his path to recovery is a lot different from my own. He actually went through the 12 steps and AA and has found it has helped him immensely in his recovery. With his story being very different from my own, it was very insightful to hear how it has helped him and hear his own perspective on it. \xa0 We hope you’ll tune in to hear more about what led to Donny’s addiction, his path to recovery, his take on traditional recovery, how yoga aided him in his recovery, how the concepts in traditional recovery resonate with him, and how his past became his purpose! \xa0 Topics Discussed: [:44] Reading the review of the week! [1:33] Sophie shares one of her favorite quotes from Rupi Kaur. [7:02] The importance of allowing yourself to feel, sharing your feelings, and confronting the root cause of these feelings.

[26:25] The conversation portion of today’s podcast. [26:50] If Donny was an ice cream flavor, which would he be and why? [30:33] One of the main reasons Donny thinks people go down the addiction route. [31:30] Donny tells the story of what led to his addiction. [39:30] What it was like for Donny in traditional recovery (12 steps), why the concept of being “powerless” resonates with him, and how his past became his purpose. [52:45] Donny explains why AA, 12 steps, and yoga works for him in maintaining his recovery. [1:01:53] Donny tells us about his transformational coaching program, The Shift. [1:05:38] What’s the best advice Donny has ever received? [1:06:11] What has been Donny’s proudest moment? [1:06:48] What has been one of Donny’s most difficult moments?

This is something that I deal with, with many of my clients — and that is, making the decision to focus on the positive. \xa0 When I was at my lowest point, I considered myself a realist. I was proud of the fact that I saw things exactly as they were. And for me, at the time, that meant a pretty strong existential crisis. My whole world was focused on these dark topics with depressing themes, which I considered at the time to be a very realistic way to view the world. \xa0 Here’s the thing: I now know that what I considered a realistic and objective view of the world was not necessarily A) as valuable as I thought it was, and B) as honest and objective as I thought it was. So that’s what I really want to talk about with you all today: making the decision of where you put your focus on. Life will always have both positive and negative aspects, so where you put your focus makes all the difference. \xa0 Topics Discussed: [:01] About upcoming IGNTD events and offerings for September’s recovery month! [1:10] About this week’s episode. [1:48] My past struggle with being a ‘realist’; not focusing on the positive. [3:55] Here’s the thing: my past view of the world was not as realistic as I thought it was. [4:18] The problem with our search for objectivity and truth. [9:50] An important exercise for you all to begin focusing on the positives. [10:40] Life has both aspects: the positives and the negatives. Here’s what we have to get good at: making the decision to focus on the positive. [11:38] Here’s what happens when you begin working on this exercise. [12:01] The qualities of a person who focuses on the positive. [12:39] My question for you: what is it you want? Do you want to be right? Or do you want to be happy? [13:31] How focusing on the positive has helped me in my own life. \xa0 Mentioned in this Episode: IGNTD Recovery Month Promotions: [ALL MONTH LONG]: IGNTD Hero Nohab Reset Program Scholarships Application We are giving away 10 scholarships to our “Nohab” Reset Program that gives you full-year access to the course that will help you discover your path to true success, identify your subconscious barriers, and reset your subconscious scripts.

Today we have another incredible guest, Mishka Shubaly. Mishka is a bestselling author, cult songwriter, and storyteller. After receiving an expensive MFA in Fiction from Columbia University, Mishka promptly realized he was more interested in playing music in dive bars than writing. He lived out of a Toyota minivan for a year, touring non-stop, and shared the stage with artists like The Strokes, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and many others! He’s become a cult favorite, opening nationally for comedy iconoclast, Doug Stanhope; penning the soundtrack for The Unbookables documentary, and headling the Altercation Punk Comedy Tour. His most recent record, “Coward’s Path,” has even won praise from Johnny Depp and Joe Perry. \xa0 But perhaps the most interesting aspect of Mishka is the incredible recovery journey that led him to where he is today. He’s lived through some traumatic life experiences and is a great example of how, as a kid, when your painful life experiences are simply brushed under the rug from those around you, it can lead to dangerous coping mechanisms and addiction. \xa0 This month is all about spreading the awareness of how everyone has their own path to recovery, and Mishka’s story illustrates this so well. He has been through a lot, so we’re sure when you hear his story — and learn about all that he struggled with and how he got to the other side — you’ll have even more hope in your own recovery journey. \xa0 We truly hope when you hear this episode you’ll also discover your own way to move forward and recover — just as Mishka has. \xa0 Topics Discussed: [:37] Kicking off the podcast with our review of the week! [1:22] Sophie reads an inspirational quote for us. [3:02] Some of our future IGNTD events and offerings this month! [5:53] About this episode’s interview with our incredible guest, Mishka Shubaly. [7:58] Our approach to recovery and how we help those struggling with our online offerings. [10:22] The main message of this recovery month. [12:45] More about today’s guest, Mishka Shubaly. [13:10] Screenshot this episode, tag us and Mishka, and let us know what most resonated with you in this episode! [14:46] Welcoming Mishka Shubaly to the podcast! [15:31] If Mishka could meet any historical figure, living or deceased, who would it be and why? [16:30] How a sustained dialogue affects how people think. [18:32] Mishka speaks about all that he does to avoid working a classic ‘9–5.’ [20:54] Mishka tells us about his background that led him to who he is today. [25:35] Mishka recounts his experience surviving a school shooting and how it affected him. [32:22] How divorce and changes have affected us and our children. [35:00] Mishka recounts a beautiful experience about teaching his younger cousin, Kai, about death and loss. [40:06] How Mishka coped with the pain from divorce and the school shooting. [43:27] Why it is worse to not acknowledge something than to have the tough conversation. [46:53] Why Mishka didn’t go the traditional route of AA for his recovery. [51:17] The moment Mishka quit drinking and why he never relapsed. [55:30] What really helped manage Mishka’s stress and kept him sober. [59:46] Why Mishka’s recovery story is both incredibly unique and not — and the important message that brings along. [1:07:07] What is the best advice Mishka has ever received? [1:07:49] What has been Mishka’s proudest moment? [1:09:05] What has been Mishka’s most difficult moment? [1:10:23] What are some of Mishka’s self-care rituals?

Each of the Philosophie superfoods and protein blends is vegan, raw, gluten-free, and has absolutely no filler ingredients. | With this month’s theme being recovery — and not just in the IGNTD space, but nationally — I thought it would be the perfect time to continue the conversation about recovery and what it means to recover. \xa0 The official government definition of recovery reads, “A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential.” And what I think is so critically important with this definition is that it does not mention abstinence at all. For a lot of people, recovery tends to be synonymous with abstinence and 100% sobriety, when it really should be the process of simply improving your life. \xa0 It is really incredibly powerful what can happen when someone enters recovery, so this week, I’m going to talk about three ways that I see recovery as being very different from this stereotypical ‘abstinence definition’ many people assign to it. I hope you’ll join me in increasing awareness around the stigma of mental health and substance use! \xa0 IGNTD Recovery Month Promotions: Week of September 2: IGNTD Hero “Nohab” Reset Program Scholarship Application (bit.ly/IGNTDScholarship) This week we launched a scholarship application with a deadline of September 30th.

[8:11] Starting with the physical aspect of recovery, I speak about what my health was like physically during peak addiction and how it has changed in recovery.

In this episode, Megan shares her feedback and personal experience trying the whole 30 diet, and how this is not a non-diet approach. We review who the diet was created for, the pros, cons and major takeaways from her experience implementing it. Overall, our goal is to show you that no external sources that tell you what you can and cannot eat is true intuitive eating, and that placing food and good or bad categories creates an all or nothing approach to food. While the episode aims to be open-minded to why someone may implement this in their lives, we feel there is no way it could heal someone's relationship with food or could be sustainable for the long term. \xa0 Get Victoria’s  FREE E-BOOK on how to ditch the diets. \xa0 Victoria’s favorite Primally Pure products:   Soothing serum  Baby oil  Baby balm  Body butter For the double cleansing method to clean your face:  cleansing oil and  baby bar  \xa0 Resources for you:  Learn more about our services at Nourishing Minds Nutrition.

This time, from a biblical perspective. Few subjects cause more controversy than vaccination - even in the church. While some church leaders have stepped out in support of vaccination, voices of opposition or concern are often ignored on the basis that "the science is settled."We believe such a complex issue warrants further discussion among believers and non-believers alike. However, regardless of where you land on the topic of vaccination, we are calling on the body of Christ to publicly support the religious freedoms that allow Christians to live in accordance with the guiding of the Holy Spirit in their lives. The freedom to opt out of all or some vaccines is one such issue.We hope this episode will provide some much needed context for this issue and prompt you to discuss this with other believers.Episode topics:3:00 - Summary of four takeaways for this episode8:45 - Immunity (natural vs artificial)12:30 - Vaccines as a contributor to decline in infectious disease14:20 - A note on the immunocompromised17:10 - Vaccine adverse event reporting19:10 - Clinical trials and placebo studies25:40 - Herd immunity30:45 - Autism, vaccine court, and the National Vaccine Injury Act (1986)41:15 - CDC whistleblower and Andy Wakefield45:25 - Aborted fetal tissue (ethical and health implications)55:45 - Should Christians be skeptical of the CDC, HHS, or vaccine manufacturers?1:01:20 - Christians and the common good1:06:45 - Vaccines as "God\'s gift," moral responsibility1:14:10 - Closing words, action itemsSupport the show | welcome Zach Bush, MD to the Very, Very, Quite Contrary podcast today!

Historically, food hasn\'t been a source of stress for me as I tend to eat intuitively and focus on ingredient quality instead of scouring the nutrition label.Unfortunately for me, I have a genetic tendency toward diabetes so we\'ve kept an eye on my blood sugar levels and insulin resistance which were getting worse. Today we\'re talking about why that happened to me and how we began to address it.Dr. Young is also sharing tips on how to find a doctor to best serve you, and even offers the ability to help those who perhaps need a doctor to listen, run the proper labs and develop a strategy to address health concerns from the root level.Audio transcript available here: http://www.jannyorganically.com/blog/2019/3/3/dr-young-pcos-foodSupport the show | Currently 1 in 4 women struggle with fertility and PCOS is a leading cause.

My guest is Jeff Witzeman, director of the film Flipping the Script: When Parents Fight Back, and he is going to share the how and why behind the U.S. medical system\'s mandates; something most people aren\'t aware of.

I’m more clear now with who I want to help, who I want to serve and who I want to attract as biz partners and customers. But to keep from falling into old habits and comforts of playing small what would you suggest? \xa0 Q2: I love that you emphasize the area “deep work” in several of your podcasts and especially in your BLL. I’m really excited to make a lot of progress in this area which is so much harder than doing what comes easy or first in my day. What are your top tips when you feel stuck and the projects are overwhelming! Does that mean we just have too much on our plate and tasks/projects need to be eliminated until I can afford to delegate more? \xa0 Q3: Tips on starting a podcast or blog. Just jump in? \xa0 Q4: To grow a large team in doTERRA you have to support and help others get their own success but you are also having to trust them with your growth and income. I have someone on my team who has trouble trusting other builders to be reliable and not quit on them. What advice do you have on this since I am sure you have had leaders quit on you? \xa0 Q5: \xa0Do you have a daily protocol that Mr. HolFit recommends for firefighters health?\xa0 \xa0 Q6: \xa0I am a huge fan of your broadcasts and truth bomb messages! Your level of organization is something I highly admire about you, and highly struggle with myself. I find that I can stay organized and systematic for a short period of time before home/business systems start to fade and papers consume my desk. What are some of your suggestions for staying *consistently* orderly in your business, home, and personal life?\xa0 \xa0 Q7: How do you optimistically and positively shine the light for people in your life, such as close family, who are very against natural health? I find myself avoiding using oils or talking about solutions because of the discouragement I end up feeling from their very closed minds when they have issues I know could be addressed with natural options. When do you leave well enough alone and when do you advocate the better way? \xa0 🖥 LINKS MENTIONED: 👉 Healthy Habits Program: www.hol-fit.com/hhprogram 👉 Digital Minimalism book: www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/ \xa0 🖥 POPULAR LINKS: 👉 doTERRA oils at 25% off: www.hol-fit.com/oils 👉 Beautiful Life Lab: www.hol-fit.com/beautifullifelabdetails 👉 HOL:FIT Coaching Tools: www.hol-fit.com/tools 👉 HOL:FIT in your inbox: http://bit.ly/holfitinbox 👉 Product Shop: www.hol-fit.com/productshop 👉 Development Library: www.hol-fit.com/library 👉 Are you a health influencer? www.hol-fit.com/healthinfluencer \xa0 You can submit questions by going to www.hol-fit.com/podcast and scrolling to the bottom to find the question submission form.\xa0 | I was just wrapping up my Sunday scrub session (www.hol-fit.com/blog/thesundayscrub) and thought I'd pop on Insta and hang with you guys for 30 min doing a little Q + A. Grabbed the audio for you here - enjoy! www.hol-fit.com \xa0 | 🙋 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED FOR THIS EPISODE:\xa0 Q1: How do you encourage development (of your doTERRA leaders) vs. duplication? Q2: Went to the Europe convention and loved it. How do I transition from using the oils for personal use to building a business? Q3: Knowing what and when to put something in the parking lot/on the back burner is sometimes overwhelming and hard to navigate, what would you suggest for developing that process more? Q4: \xa0Hi Ange! I am 23 years old and I have so many goals in life. But one of my deepest intentions is to be the healthiest version of myself. To eat the best, nourish my body, feel my best etc. A big part of my motivation is seeing myself being financially stable so I CAN be the healthiest version of myself and provide for my future family. I want to know - when you were 23 years old, did you feel like this was out of reach? Were you always as healthy and wise as you are now? And what helped you over time get to where you are today? Q5: Does DoTERRA release the links to the research studies? Like peer reviewed human studies that are being performed? I know you’ve mentioned it would be irresponsible to publicly state that a specific oil is good for a specific disease, but is there a library where we can direct people to read the studies? DoTerra mentions the pubmed and google scholar on their blog. Are these the best tools to direct people to? Also can you talk about some reasons why having the oils approved by FDA is not necessary or wouldn’t necessarily be a good idea? Q6: Hello! I am a new mom of an almost 1 year old. Even though it is years away, I have already started thinking about schooling options, as I want to make sure the type of education we choose lines up with our home values as much as possible. I recently heard you to talk in another episode about your girls attending a Waldorf school, so I was wondering if you could speak a little more about a Waldorf education in general. I have researched on my own of course, but I always understand things better when you articulate them, and I always trust your opinions! You have truly been a light in my life, helping me to build such a beautiful life for my family through your lab! XO Q7: As someone in doTERRA, I'm learning how to get back to the basics and not feel like I need to keep reinventing the wheel to get somewhere. My struggle is learning how to balance using the tools and resources I have without getting distracted or without focusing on the nitty gritty things. You often mention how important it is to not let your phone hold you captive, but I'm finding that when it comes to contacting people or making new contacts, I typically end up having to use my phone for that and I can get caught up in the back and forth that I end up losing track of time and not accomplishing much by the end. Same thing with the computer. I have turned off all my notifications for 98% of my apps that have been distracting me the most, and I have organized them into folders like you had mentioned, but I still seem to be getting lost in it. What are some suggestions you have for those of us who are still needing to use our phones for work but don't want to be working for our phones and getting as distracted? Q8: \xa0I would love to know what you think the next wave of doTERRA looks like and what the second generation Diamonds will need to do to get there. 🗓 Join us for the next live Q+A podcast: Wed June 26th. \xa0 PODCAST LINKS: 🖥 Join LIVE on the last Wed of the month at 2pm EST: www.hol-fit.com/live 🎧 SUBSCRIBE to the podcast: http://bit.ly/holfittalks 📒 All episodes + show notes: www.hol-fit.com/podcast \xa0 🖥 LINKS MENTIONED: 👉 Healthy Habits Program: bit.ly/habitsprogram 👉 Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice 👉 Waldorf school blog of public school vs waldorf 👉 The HOL:FIT Superbrew Coffee Recipe \xa0 🖥 POPULAR LINKS: 👉 doTERRA oils at 25% off: www.hol-fit.com/oils 👉 Beautiful Life Lab: www.hol-fit.com/beautifullifelabdetails 👉 HOL:FIT Coaching Tools: www.hol-fit.com/tools 👉 HOL:FIT in your inbox: http://bit.ly/holfitinbox 👉 Product Shop: www.hol-fit.com/productshop 👉 Development Library: www.hol-fit.com/library 👉 Are you a health influencer?\xa0www.hol-fit.com/healthinfluencer \xa0 \xa0 | Welcome to episode 50 of\xa0HOL:FIT Talks! 🗒 ON TODAY’S SHOW: It's Q + A Day where much of the conversation focused on using discernment, building trust with ourselves and having nothing to prove.\xa0  🖥 Join LIVE on the last Wed of the month at 2pm EST: http://www.hol-fit.com/live 🎧 SUBSCRIBE to the podcast: http://bit.ly/holfittalks 📒 All episodes + show notes: http://www.hol-fit.com/podcast  🗓 UPDATES:  Ready Set Glow: The week long detox program runs April 29 - May 5! \xa0This is a program open to anyone for purchase!

April 30th is drawing near so I’m sure you’re in the tax space right now.  \xa0 🙋 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED FOR THIS SHOW: Q1: What about people who won’t use oils in clinics or offices or public places because of the “scent allergy” what do you suggest for people to turn to for resources? Q2: Not Looking to bash another company however I have customers discussing switching to Revive. When I looked into it, they are comparing their oils to doTERRA (which is flattering but insane that their claiming internal use is safe with their oils). However people who don't get the true value are now believening this is a legit company. Any insights into this and is doTERRA \xa0taking any action or how to handle it with my customers? Q3: Not super conversation-promoting, but what brand of coffee do you use and what’s your preferred coffee maker/machine? Q4: Hi Ange! Thanks for all the value that you add to the community! I'm in South Africa which is just about to open as a new market. My question is what tips would you give someone like me on how to build in a new market? Like when you started, there's very little brand awareness in my country. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Q5: What do you say to people that say “we don’t believe in oils” I seem to be coming across more people that don’t “believe” in them and don’t want to even give it a try? Q6: Can you talk about Collaboration? Specifically if there are a few doTerra leaders in one town or area from different teams......what might that look like? Advantage? how can support, encourage and engage each other-co-teach etc. and still all grow and thrive to the levels we desire. Joining together to beat scarcity mentality and lift each other up w/o competition or “edginess” Q7: When learning/growing as a leader how do you portray authenticity with currently learning while being the point person - specifically for your online audience? \xa0 🖥 LINKS MENTIONED: 👉 RSG: www.hol-fit.com/glowdetox 👉 Study:  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/newborn-babies-chemicals-exposure-bpa/ 👉 Healthy Home Shop: www.hol-fit.com/healthyhomeshop \xa0 🖥 POPULAR LINKS: 👉 Essential oils at 25% off: http://hol-fit.com/oils 👉 Beautiful Life Lab: http://hol-fit.com/beautifullifelabdetails 👉 HOL:FIT Coaching Tools: http://hol-fit.com/tools 👉 HOL:FIT in your inbox: http://bit.ly/holfitinbox 👉 Product Shop: www.hol-fit.com/productshop 👉 Development Library: www.hol-fit.com/library 👉 Are you a health influencer?

Some advice from nutritionists is great for the majority of the population but not women with PCOS. \xa0I really empathise with anyone struggling with hairloss, and it does take a long time to see changes.\xa0 However, the next 12 months are going to pass anyway, so you might as well use them to be addressing your ‘root cause’ right?If you missed it last week, I compiled a download of some evidence backed natural treatments and the full thyroid panel to rule this out as a cause for hair loss.\xa0Download that here at www.thepcosnutritionist.comSupport the show | Hair loss isn’t a symptom that I’ve had to endure, but I have complete and utter empathy for anyone that has.\xa0 It’s devastating, and in my experience has a similar impact on a woman’s life as those struggling to conceive.\xa0If you’re struggling with hair loss there are three steps that you need to go through:\xa0What’s causing your hair loss?\xa0Firstly we want to make sure that it’s definitely PCOS that’s causing your hair loss.\xa0 I’ve worked with many women who thought that their PCOS was causing their hair loss, only to discover that they also had hypothyroidism and that was actually the main cause.\xa0 So I give you some tips on how to tell the difference.\xa02. If it’s hypothyroidism, then we need to know is if it’s pure Hypothyroidism or the autoimmune version Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Reason being, the treatments differ and if you have the autoimmune version, you may be at more risk of developing autoimmune alopecia.\xa03.\xa0 If it’s PCOS, then what’s happening is your ‘male’ hormones (testosterone and DHEAS) are being converted into the more potent form, DHT which is then killing your hair follicles, making the strands fall out.\xa0 So, as always, we need to find out why your body is making too much of these ‘male’ hormones.\xa0 Is it:\xa0InsulinAdrenalInflammation\xa0Then, just like the last couple of episodes on acne, I also dive into some of the common medications and topical treatments for hair loss that you can talk to your doctor about, and what the pros and cons of those are.\xa0Then we also dive into the research on some natural treatments for hair loss (which there is some promising research on too).\xa0As per the acne episodes, I’ve also compiled those natural treatments into a handy downloadable PDF for you too, so you don’t have to remember all the details, you can find that at\xa0\xa0https://thepcosnutritionist.com/blogs/ | Today on the podcast we’re continuing with our chat all about acne. \xa0\xa0If you’ve suffered with acne, you’ve likely been blown off by multiple medical professionals.\xa0Acne is certainly nothing to scoff at, especially not if you have debilitating painful cystic acne, or you’re getting it well after your teens.\xa0\xa0And most importantly it can be the giant squawking canary in the coalmine telling you that there is something not right in your body. \xa0\xa0\xa0This is exactly what happened to my guest this week, Erin.\xa0 She shares her PCOS story, specifically her struggles with acne, what worked and what (definitely) didn't work. But more importantly, she shares that in this process of fixing her acne, she found out that her insulin wasn’t functioning properly.\xa0 If she’d not discovered that, she could have been on the path to Type 2 diabetes in a few years time. \xa0Some of the key things that we discuss today are:\xa0What hormonal birth control does to our insulinWhy the advice is not to diagnose girls with PCOS until at least after they are 16Why it isn’t a good idea to go on hormonal birth control as a young teenHow insulin contributes to AcneWhy being lean, definitely doesn’t mean your insulin is working correctlyWhy Zinc can often work wonders for AcneWhy the pill won’t ‘fix’ periods or acne- when you come off it it comes back worseFixing your PCOS ‘root cause’ (in Erin’s case insulin), can work wonders for improving symptoms!If you missed it last week, I created a PDF of some of my favourite clean beauty products for acne.\xa0 While acne needs to be treated from the inside (hello ‘root cause’), beauty products that stop the bacterial infection that causes the pustule can be a life saver.DOWNLOAD that at www.thepcosnutritionist.com\xa0P.S If you’re listening to Erin and thinking ‘hot damn, that program sounds exactly what I need!”, here’s all the info. \xa0 As a quick summary, it’s an 8 module program that we deliver to you over 12 weeks to make sure that you have time to implement it all.\xa0 We start by identifying what’s likely contributing to your PCOS i.e. ‘root cause’ (like Erin’s insulin was). Then we give you the most important changes you can make to what you eat, and how you live to fix that ‘root cause’. Any questions?\xa0 Flick us an email at hello@thepcosnutritionist.com, we’re more than happy to help | If you’re like me and think that in your late 20s, 30s and 40s you should no longer have to deal with acne, then this week's podcast episode is for you.\xa0As you’re probably aware, I’m a big fan of treating the root cause of any of our PCOS symptoms, naturally. But I’m absolutely not against the use of medications, I jut think they should be at least alongside treating the root cause. \xa0I also think that you should be able to make an informed choice about how you treat yoru acne.\xa0 \xa0 We’re all adults and part of being an adult is that you get to choose what you want to do.\xa0 But part of the decision making process is weighing up the pros and cons, and how are we to make an informed decision if we don’t have all the facts? \xa0So in this in this episode I cover off the conventional PCOS acne treatments, and in the interest of truly informed consent I’m going to give you the facts about how these medications actually work, their effectiveness, the pros and the potential long term effects. .\xa0 These conventional treatments include: \xa0Roaccutane/ AccutaneSpironolactoneHormonal birth control\xa0AntibioticsThen I’ll go into the more functional medicine based treatments i.e. treating the root cause of your high androgens (testosterone).\xa0 The most common being:High insulinHigh stress hormonesOveractive immune system/ inflammationBUT at the same time as doing this, topical treatments like face washes and creams can be really effective.\xa0 While the first part of the acne formation process is the overproduction of oil, the second is the pores getting clogged and infected.\xa0 So if you can stop the infection, you can potentially stop the acne.\xa0 This is where face washes and creams can come in very handy.\xa0But most of the conventional creams and washes are full of harsh chemicals.\xa0 I’ve spent years researching and testing on my skin, more of the ‘clean’ beauty products.\xa0So for today’s episode, I’ve created a download of the tried and tested ‘clean beauty’ acne products that have worked for me or for my clients. \xa0You can find that at www.thepcosnutritionist.comSupport the show | I’m back again this week, with one of my all time favourite women, Dr Lara Briden,\xa0 The Period Revolutionary.\xa0This episode is part 2 of our discussion all about PCOS and Endometriosis. \xa0Last week we covered off: \xa0What is Endometriosis?What causes endo?What are the symptoms?How do the symptoms differ from PCOS?How is endo diagnosed?So this week we’re talking all about the TREATMENT options- both conventional and functional. \xa0We talk about:\xa0SurgeryHormonal contraceptive\xa0Diet\xa0Supplements and much more \xa0As always, Lara provides a ton of value about the different treatment options, how to combine treatments and lots of information on hormonal contraceptives and progesterone treatment for endometriosis that I wasn't even aware of. \xa0Support the show | Have you been told that your period pain is because you have PCOS?\xa0One of my all time favourite women, Dr Lara Briden, the period revolutionary, is joining me on the podcast this week to explain why severe period pain is not a symptom of PCOS and is more likely a symptom of Endometriosis. \xa0About 10% of all women have endometriosis, coincidentally about the same number that have PCOS. \xa0They are both very common conditions, which means that for many of you, you might have both.\xa0 And given it takes women on average 8 YEARS (!) to get diagnosed with endometriosis, it’s likely that you may have both and don’t know about it.\xa0So in this episode we cover off some of the most important topics around endometriosis and PCOS such as:\xa0What is Endometriosis?What causes endo?What are the symptoms?How do the symptoms differ from PCOS?How is endo diagnosed?As Lara and I love to chat for hours when we get together this podcast went a bit overtime, so I’ve had to split it into two.\xa0 So next week, we’ll be back with the second part which is mainly about the treatment options for endometriosis. \xa0Thinking that you don’t have endo, so this episode doesn’t apply to you? \xa0No no no no non NO! \xa0You are exactly who this is for- as I said above it affects 1 in 10 women, you can have both and given it takes 8 years to get diagnosed, you’ll likely not know about it.Even if this is not you, you may pick up on some symptoms that sound distinctly like a sister, friend, cousin daughter or colleague of yours.\xa0Support the show | What do you do if you’re young, and by all accounts ‘healthy’ and slim ...but you’ve suddenly been told that you’re infertile and need IUI or IVF to conceive?Well if you’re Sara, you don’t take that as gospel and you seek a second and third opinion.\xa0Today’s podcast is another real-life story with the amazing Sara who I’ve had the pleasure of working with inside The PCOS Protocol. \xa0Like many of us, Sara had been on birth control since a young age and came off after getting married.\xa0 She had been trying to get pregnant for a year, and when the drug Clomid wasn’t successful, she was told:\xa0“I think you might have lean\xa0 PCOS, but how we’re going to get around that is by doing IUI”But she didn’t accept this solution. \xa0“We’d been kind of trying to get pregnant with 6th grade knowledge of how to get pregnant and then suddenly our next option was IVF.\xa0 It just didn't stack up.\xa0 I want to understand my body and why we were not conceiving, rather than just jumping straight to IVI and IVF.”She subsequently found out that her insulin wasn’t working properly- even though she is lean.\xa0 After tweaking her diet and lifestyle she also learnt to track her cycles to identify when she was leading up to ovulation.\xa0\xa0She ovulated 4 months later and got pregnant with that ovulation. \xa0Highlights, takeaways and quick wins\xa0Whether you’re lean or not, it doesn’t matter, you still need to get to that root cause for why your body isn’t ovulating, and it is really likely that your insulin isn’t working properly.\xa0Your ‘normal’ HbA1c and other insulin markers doesn’t necessarily mean your insulin is working properly.\xa0Your doctor will likely jump straight to drug therapy like Clomid, or IUI and IVF and while these are\xa0 amazing treatments, they often aren’t necessary and don’t come without riek. \xa0Your doctor likely won’t be able to investigate the root cause for you because they don’t have the knowledge to do this- it’s like asking a builder to install all the plumbing for your bathroom.\xa0 They might have some understanding because they work with them all the time, but it isn’t their expertise. \xa0When you have issues with your insulin it isn’t just about ‘eating healthy’- Sara has a great example of what fruit did to her blood sugar.\xa0You can get pregnant, even without having a period in months- if you know the signs to look for that you’re leading up to ovulation.\xa0Pregnancy has been shown to push the human body to the limit,\xa0 so you want to make sure that you’re in the best possibly place before getting pregnant- this is what clomid, IUI or IVF will never do. \xa0Fertility treatments can be super useful, but in my mind they always come after treating the root cause.\xa0Download the tests for PCOS at www.thepcosnutritonist.comSupport the show | Nothing gives me more back shivers than helping a couple conceive.\xa0But it’s such a misunderstood area in PCOS.\xa0When we are diagnosed with PCOS, we’re told things like “You’re going to struggle to conceive”.\xa0 But this doesn’t have to be the case. \xa0While you might not be ovulating or getting pregnant at that time, it doesn’t mean that you’ll never be able to ovulate or get pregnant.\xa0 In most cases just need to tweak a few parts of your diet and lifestyle.The secret is to find out what’s going wrong and address the root cause. \xa0So that’s exactly what I outline on today’s podcast.\xa0In this episode I explain that baking a baby is like baking a cake. This may seem simplistic, especially when there are so many complicated medical tests and treatments, and given the harrowing years so many of you had with your fertility journey.\xa0But when it comes down to it, the process is straight forward, we need to make sure you’ve got all the right ingredients.\xa0The 3 fertile ingredients are:\xa01.\xa0 You need enough good quality ingredients\xa0You can’t make a cake if you’re missing eggs, flour and butter (or you’re trying to substitute margarine for butter, woof), and you can’t make a baby if you don’t have a good quality egg and sperm.\xa02. Correct timing\xa0Just like you need to cream the butter and sugar together before adding the dry ingredients to bake a cake, you also need correct timing to make a baby.\xa0 You need to make sure you’re timing sex correctly so there is sperm waiting for the egg to be released i.e. pre ovulation. And of course, your body also needs to get it’s hormonal orchestra in sync so that you can ovulate.\xa03.\xa0 You need to have a cake tin that stays intact long enough for the cake to finish baking.\xa0\xa0If not, you’re going to end up with a big pile of goo on the bottom of your oven. Similarly, you need your uterine lining to be a nice habitable nest and you need enough progesterone for it to stay in place long enough for that fertilised egg to burrow in there.\xa0 If not, then you’ll get your period before it’s had a chance to burrow in, or before the baby is able to produce its own progesterone at 12 weeks.\xa0I use these three steps like a decision tree with any of my patients to identify where we need to focus.\xa0 We go through each step and find out where the problem is.\xa0“Are you ovulating?\xa0 No? Okay that’s where we are going to start”\xa0Then I implement my 5 step process to address that root cause.\xa0 This is what I also outline in today’s podcast. \xa0And in the most fortuitous timing, I have a great story to share with you on this.\xa0As I’m writing this, it’s 6am in New Zealand, it’s still dark outside so I’m putting off my workout until it’s light and in the meantime checked my emails to see the subject line:“Positive Test”\xa0From one of my clients, and then, “I’m in shock”.This gave me all of the back shivers, and while I’m so incredibly delighted for her, I’m not shocked. \xa0Like me, she was told “You’re going to struggle to conceive” and while this pregnancy has been a few months in the making, we had a plan to work to.\xa0We identified what fertile ingredients weren’t working, we then identified why they weren’t working (the root cause),we changed her diet and lifestyle to suit, and gave her a few extra supplement boosts. \xa0She put in the work, got back ovulating, and then  | Let me ask you something.\xa0 Do you feel hungry all the time?\xa0Not just like you could eat sometime soon, but the kind of hunger that makes you count every. single. excruciating. minute. between 10am and lunchtime.\xa0Along with weight gain, sugar cravings, infertility, irregular periods and fatigue, this is what Katherine was dealing with on a daily basis.\xa0 However it was when the fatigue started to stop her from pedalling her bike full steam after her kids, that she said enough is enough!In this episode as with all my interviews with the amazing women I work with, we hear Katherine’s whole story to give you some context.\xa0 But some of the things of significant that we discuss are:\xa0The effect weight gain and societal expectations around weight have on teenagesrs and the development of disordered eatingInsulin: part of Katherine’s root cause, but never picked up or explained previously\xa0Why Insulin makes us HANGRY and crave sugar all the timeWhy Insulin also makes us inappropriately hungry\xa0Hypothyroidism, especially the autoimmune version, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, affects up to a quarter of all women with PCOSLow thyroid hormone, even if it’s not out of the reference range can seriously impact your fertility (see the study linked below).\xa0Why low thyroid and high insulin makes us exhausted\xa0Why menopause is not going to improve your PCOS symptoms and neither is getting a hysterectomy!Why getting out and sharing what you know about PCOS can help so many of your friends who may be suffering in silence.As Katherine says, improving her insulin hasn’t just improved her weight, energy, moods, it’s also allowed her to focus on more important things now that she’s not hungry and thinking about food ALL the time: \xa0“It’s freed up a part of my brain that was constantly obsessed with food so I can focus on more important things” like chilling out with ‘The Tattooist of Auschwitz’ (my current book club read which is unputdownable). \xa0If you’re constantly hungry and/or hangry, you cannot underestimate how life changing this is.\xa0 As Katherine says:\xa0 “Not being hungry is like a torture has been lifted.” \xa0Don’t put up with it. You can be one of those people who forgets to eat lunch- outrageous, I know!First things first, find out if your insulin is working properly.\xa0 Either download our tests for insulin resistance (in the podcast show notes), or come and join us in The PCOS Protocol where we use symptoms if you can’t get any labs/ tests completed.\xa0 Don’t let not being able to get labs stop you from getting help!\xa0Other links: \xa0Some of the research articles that I discuss in the episode:\xa0Rotterdam criteria for PCOS:\xa0 https://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/467811Hypothyroidism: if your TSH is above 2.5, you will likely have trouble conceiving:\xa0 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25312747 | This!\xa0 If you only listen to one episode over the next few weeks- THIS is the episode.\xa0 I can’t wait for you to hear this interview with Dimity because her story because it is so real and relatable.\xa0 Dimity is a super busy psychologist, flying all over Australia to work on some pretty harrowing jobs. Needless to say stress was HIGH.\xa0 But even though she was preaching every day to others about what stress does to the body, she had no idea just how much it was affecting her PCOS symptoms- especially her acne, fatigue and fertility. This doesn’t mean that she had to quit her job.\xa0 Instead, we just made a few critical tweaks to her diet and lifestyle and the symptoms she’d been told by her gynae were just ‘her normal’ started to resolve. \xa0Highlights, takeaways and quick wins:High stress and lack of sleep can cause our insulin to skyrocket- even when we are eating exactly the same diet.\xa0Insulin is what causes our testosterone to rise which stimulates acne, contributes to infertility and weight gainWe don’t have to eat perfectly to improve our insulin. \xa0Hangry attacks are a real thing- and are likely a big sign that your insulin isn’t working properly.\xa0Treating the root cause of PCOS can dramatically reduce the risk of pregnancy complications when you do conceive.Fertility: AMH test for egg count is a really inaccurate test, but often used by fertility centres to get you to spend money and freeze your eggs.Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association\xa0 showed that low AMH diminished ovarian reserve was not associated with infertilityActually they found that women with a low AMH have an 84% chance of getting pregnant within 12 months, compared with 75% of those who had a normal AMH. \xa0Eating less and exercising more is very rarely the answer for PCOS weightloss.\xa0Weight gain is not your fault- it’s generally due to insulinWeight loss will not ‘cure’ your PCOS symptomsOne of the most important things we did for Dimity was to identify that her insulin (the hormone that regulates our blood sugar) weren’t working properly and this was part of her PCOS ‘root cause’.\xa0 The second part was recognising that it wasn’t just her diet that was contributing to her high insulin, it was also stress.\xa0Up to 80% of women with PCOS have some insulin resistance which is contributing to their PCOS- so this is likely you too.\xa0 But you might not know this because you haven’t had the correct tests for insulin taken.\xa0 So I’ve created a download of the best tests for insulin to pick up early stage insulin resistance.

Lowery. \xa0 He earned his BS and MS in exercise physiology and exercise and nutrition science from the University of Tampa and completed his doctorate work at Concordia University in Health and Human Performance with a focus on “The Effects of a Well-Formulated Ketogenic Diet and Exogenous Ketone Supplementation on Various Markers of Health and Body Composition in Healthy and Diseased Populations.” \xa0 Over his career, Ryan has published over 150 papers, abstracts, and book chapters on human performance and sports nutrition and has dedicated his life to educating the masses. In his free time, Ryan enjoys spending time with his best friend, Scoot the Keto Pup, jet skiing, and traveling around the world. The way to his heart is through a good glass of wine and Keto desserts. \xa0 In this episode, Ryan and I talk about his amazing story and what he is currently working on. First, Ryan reveals what ignited his passion for educating people on the importance of healthy eating. Then, Ryan explains the future of obesity and why inspired action is the only thing that will change the world. He also describes tips for eating Keto, why some people fail when trying the lifestyle, and how you can gain muscle.

When he got there, his grandmother had passed. His grandmother was obese, which ultimately contributed to her passing in her early 60’s. This initiated Ryan’s entire journey of educating people.  \xa0 [03:45] The Future of Obesity  The obesity trend in children is unacceptable. Obesity trends are not only in America, but it is also happening all over the world. At the end of the day, it takes inspired action.  \xa0 [06:50] How Ryan Started with Keto  Ryan is a self-proclaimed carboholic. After college, Ryan could no longer eat his normal amount of carbs. He realized his metabolism wasn’t the same. The first time Ryan started the keto diet, he felt terrible. Three times a day, he would make keto moose, and that was literally all he ate.  \xa0 [10:00] Biggest Reason for the Keto Flu  It is going to take time for your body to adjust to using fat as fuel. The use of electrolytes can mitigate a lot of the flu. Sodium has been demonized; however, you need to be salting everything. Some people can completely switch to keto, whereas other people need to transition to the diet slowly. Make habit changes to develop a long-term lifestyle.  \xa0 [13:45] Building Muscle with the Ketogenic Diet  You need to allow time for the adaptation period. The phase may be one to three weeks. Plus, you probably will not be training as hard. After you adapt, the ketogenic diet group will gain just as much muscle as individuals who are eating a carbohydrate diet. Each group ate the exact same amount of protein.  \xa0 [17:40] Why People Fail with the Ketogenic Diet  A lot of people do not have the right information about the ketogenic diet. Also, people have trouble understanding what constitutes a well-formulated ketogenic diet and how to get electrolytes. Eating keto isn’t about eating high-fat, it is about eating low-carb.  \xa0 [20:10] Long-Term Keto Success  Dial-in the electrolytes. Don’t be afraid of having tons of sodium. However, you don’t want table salt. Movement – if you want long-term benefits, you need some form of movement. This doesn’t have to be doing squats at the gym; you could be going for a walk or a hike once a day. Mindset – Ryan calls it intermittent eating rather than intermittent fasting. Find a place where you are comfortable.  \xa0 [24:00] Working Out While Fasting  If your goal is to become a bodybuilder, working out while fasting probably won’t help with that goal. Ryan recommends shifting your eating habits earlier. Many people skip breakfast, then eat lunch and dinner. Ryan says to eat a bigger breakfast and then eat a smaller dinner.  \xa0 [27:35] The Ketogenic Bible   The Ketogenic Bible: The Authoritative Guide to Ketosis makes understanding keto practical. Jacob Wilson and Ryan Lowery offer a comprehensive look at the ketogenic diet and the fat-burning state it induces, ketosis. Ryan’s favorite part of writing the book was looking up the history. For instance, Ryan found out the political motivations behind the reason’s society eats the way it does. Butter is back, and avocado sales are soaring.  \xa0 [35:00] The Applied Science & Performance Institute \xa0  Their mission is to challenge current dogma in the health and human performance realms with new insight to effectively promote a healthy lifestyle and optimize physical performance. They want the information they find out from research to get out to the masses as soon as possible. To support the institute check out their website: The Applied Science & Performance Institute  \xa0 [39:00] The Ketogenic Diet Puts You at a Metabolic Advantage\xa0  You are burning fat at a higher rate with ketosis. All calories are not the same. Carb calories vs. fiber calories are completely different. If you are trying to diet on a low-fat diet vs. a low-carb diet, the adherence rate to a low-carb diet is much higher. On a low-carb diet, people tend to eat fewer calories by nature.  \xa0 [49:00] What Ryan is Most Excited About  The potential we see in the neurological areas is so fascinating because keto is much more than a fat loss lifestyle. Keto provides a fuel source for the brain to utilize. Ryan works with NFL alumni. Some of them can’t leave their house without a monitor because they don’t know how to get home. Instead of attacking it with drugs, it could be their brain starving for energy.  \xa0 [55:30] The Definition of Perfect Health  Health is multifaceted. Living in a state of fulfillment and gratitude will take up a majority of our health. We could be in a poor state internally, but if we are fulfilled, then we are in a far better state than someone who is not.  \xa0 AND MUCH MORE! \xa0 Resources from this episode:  Visit Ryan’s Website Visit Ketogenic.com Watch Ryan’s KetoCon 2018 Talk Connect with Dr. Ryan P.

Named by Prevention the nation’s leading female innovator in the natural products industry, Naomi is hailed as a trailblazer and an advocate of purity and potency in nutraceuticals. \xa0 Naomi continues to deliver on her promise to help millions thrive with award-winning supplements they know will truly help them. A premier wellness partner for QVC, Naomi has also been recognized as one of the leading innovators in the natural products industry by Whole Foods Magazine in their exclusive “Who’s Who of Manufacturers and Suppliers.” \xa0 Her story and products have been lauded by The Wall Street Journal, Vogue, ELLE, Harper’s Bazaar, ABC News, PBS, InStyle, The View, The Doctors, Dr. Oz, SHAPE, Access Hollywood, Natural Solutions, Good Morning America, Today Show and more. \xa0 She is a steward of sustainability, a sought-after keynote speaker, and a member of the UN Chamber of Commerce Foundation. Naomi lives in Boca Raton, Florida with her husband and their four children. \xa0 In this episode, Naomi and I talked about the journey that led her to where she is today. First, Naomi reveals some health troubles she had growing up, which led her to try some alternative medicines. In the end, it had a damaging effect on her health. Then, Naomi explains the inspiration behind her book and docuseries while giving tips on antiaging and feeling our best. She also describes how she landed a rare interview with a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Tune in! \xa0 FREE KETO KICKSTART GUIDE: http://www.ketokickstartguide.com\xa0 \xa0 The Real Skinny on Fat Docuseries:\xa0http://bit.ly/2kmITwE \xa0 [00:50] Naomi’s Previous Health Problems  She spent her early childhood on an organic, biodynamic farm in Switzerland. Because her father is a chemist, he would teach Naomi about the essential elements needed as part of a health-promoting diet. Naomi suffered from debilitating eczema for which nothing seemed to work-not even traditional medicine. An acupuncturist provided her with a curative path through herbs and treatments. The symptoms of her eczema subsided over time. However, Naomi was confronted with dangerous levels of toxicity from heavy metals in the herbs she had ingested.  \xa0 [08:11] The Queen of Autophagy  Naomi travels all over to different parts of the world and sees the trends that will eventually make their way to the United States. She got into autophagy intuitively – she recognized that she had to be building or removing. Green juices helped Naomi to eliminate her toxic load.  \xa0 [10:00] You Need to Start Eating Citrus Bergamont  Naomi met with Dr. Elizabeth Janda, a researcher in Italy, opened Naomi’s eyes to this lifechanging fruit. Traditionally, the fruit is used to treat high cholesterol. Melitidin and brutieridin, discourage the production of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol while helping your body make HDL (“good”) cholesterol.  \xa0 [12:55] Activating Autophagy  You can activate autophagy through exercise, sleeping, different foods, and a specific type of mindset. You can read Naomi’s book about autophagy here:  Glow15: A Science-Based Plan to Lose Weight, Revitalize Your Skin, and Invigorate Your Life  \xa0 [15:15] Interviewing a Nobel Prize Winner  Naomi landed a rare interview with Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi on autophagy. She cried tears of admiration after the interview because he is so humble. Ohsumi was malnourished as a child and dreamed of being a scientist. He created a whole body of work and research on autophagy.  \xa0 [18:20] How Skincare Relates to Autophagy  Naomi worked with a Richard C. Wang, a dermatologist, to determine how to activate autophagy in the skin. She brought him hundreds of ingredients. Dr. Wang discovered which ingredients would activate the autophagy:  Caffeine Ceramides Polyphenols Trehalose   Your skin is just a mirror of what is going on inside. Women in their 50’s may have skin that looks so much older because of the different fibers. Women have to become smart about activating autophagy in the skin to stay looking young.  \xa0 [23:00] Antiaging Tips  Learn how to activate cellular autophagy.  It’s good for detoxing.   Tap into your circadian rhythm. Teach your body to utilize good stress.  Exercising can be a form of good stress. Autophagy loves good stress which has a massive antiaging effect.    \xa0 [26:05] The Real Skinny on Fat  Naomi interviewed over 80 experts for her docuseries The Real Skinny on Fat. Oz did a whole show on keto and showed parts of her docuseries. Some of the key points Naomi took out of it:  We want to burn fat as our core fuel. 25% of the population can utilize carbohydrates effectively. For those who can’t, it’s better not to bother.   Nuts are not the best way to get your fats because they aren’t the cleanest fuel. A lot of times, they are not gluten-free. We have the power to give our bodies exactly what we need; it’s not as complicated as we imagine. Naomi started by first interviewing Dr. Jeff Bland - Founder and Pioneer in Functional Medicine. She worked on the docuseries during the weekends and at night because of her full-time job. However, she still got all of the sleep she needed and ate a keto diet.  \xa0 [35:45] Navigating Self-Limiting Beliefs  Naomi started working on her belief system when she was 12 years old because of eczema. We have to nurture our brain by giving it our favorite foods and sleep. Our brains cleanse themselves while we are sleeping. At a young age, Naomi knew she could get away from negative thoughts by working on her subconscious mind. When she starts to hear negative thoughts, she uses affirmations. Naomi also uses neuro-linguistic programming.  \xa0 [41:40] Whole Body Metabolism  What we believe about metabolism is just a tiny fraction of what it is. Naomi’s next book will be about this very topic.  \xa0 \xa0 AND MUCH MORE! \xa0 Resources from this episode:  Visit Naomi Whittel’s Website Connect with Naomi Whittel:  Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram    Glow15: A Science-Based Plan to Lose Weight, Revitalize Your Skin, and Invigorate Your Life by Naomi Whittel Rare Interview with Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi on Autophagy The Real Skinny on Fat  \xa0  Email me at ben@ketokamp.com Join the The Keto Kamp Inner Circle  \xa0 This podcast is for information purposes only.

Try them for $1.00 www.ketokampolive.com\xa0 \xa0 The 4 key foods to stimulate neurogenesis: \xa0 1) Blueberries. I have blueberries just about every single day, and I recommend it to my clients. Not only is it low in sugar compared to other fruits, it is also packed full of antioxidants. Blueberries act in so many ways to promote neurogenesis and protect the brain from cognitive decline. \xa0 Numerous studies show adding blueberries to the daily diet of mice increases neurogenesis significantly. \xa0 Casadesus, G., Shukitt-Hale, B., Stellwagen, H.M., et al. (Oct 2004). “Modulation of hippocampal plasticity and cognitive behavior by short-term blueberry supplementation in aged rats.” Nutritional Neuroscience. 7(5-6):309-16. \xa0 Acosta, S., Jernberg, J., Sanberg, C.D., Sanberg, P.R., Small, B.J., Gemma, C., Bickford, P.C. (Oct 2010). Rejuvenation Res. 13 (5):581-8. doi 10.1089/rej.1011. Epub 29 Jun 2010. \xa0 Joseph, J.A., Shukitt-Hale, B., Lau, F. C. “Fruit polyphenols and their effects on neuronal signaling and behavior in senescence.” Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. \xa0 Consuming about 1 cup per day is the equivalent human portion that animal studies have suggested. Here’s a bonus tip, buy wild organic frozen blueberries. New\xa0research from South Dakota State University [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/1 722124810.htm] suggests that frozen blueberries deliver a bigger dose of disease-fighting antioxidants than fresh. These antioxidants come from compounds called anthocyanins, which give blueberries their purple hue. The ice crystals that form when the berries are frozen disrupt the structure of the plant tissue and make anthocyanins more available. The anthocyanin dye, which causes the dark blue color, crosses the blood-brain barrier to stimulate neurogenesis. [Page 61] \xa0 Humans with cognitive decline showed improvements after consuming blueberries daily. \xa0 Devore. E. E., Kang, J.H., Bretellen, M. M., Grodstein, F. A. (July 2012). “Dietary intakes of berries and flavonoids in relation to cognitive decline.” Neurology. 72(1):135-43. Doi: 10.1002/ana.23594. Epub 26 Apr 2012. \xa0 Joseph, J.A., Shukitt-Hale, B., Willis, L. M. (Sep 2009). “Grape juice, berries, and walnuts affect brain aging and behavior.” Journal of Nutrition. 139(9):1813S-7S. Doi: 10.3945/jn.109.108266. Epub 29 Jul 2099. Review. \xa0 Aside from increasing neurogenesis, blueberries allow better communication among neurons, something called signal transduction. [Page 62] \xa0 Studies have shown that blueberry extracts are as effective as fresh blueberries.[page 62] In most animal studies it’s the extract that is used. This makes daily blueberry intake possible for those who don’t have access to fresh blueberries.  Life Extension makes a great blueberry extract product. \xa0 2) Omega 3s. Another neurogenesis superstar is the complex of omega-3 fatty acids, found in abundance in cold water fish, including wild Alaskin salmon, coho and sockeye salmon, black cod, sablefish, sardines, and herrings. Omega-3s have been shown to dramatically increase neurogenesis and BDNF Levels. [Page 62] \xa0 Neuroscience researcher Sandrine Thuret, Ph.D., of London’s Kings College, reported a 40% increase in neurogenesis by adding omega-3’s in Science Daily in 2007. Other studies have shown impressive results in neurogenesis, elevated BDNF levels, increased in brain size, and neuroprotective benefits from omega-3s. \xa0 Conklin, S.M., Gianaros, P.J., Brown, S.M., et al. (29 June 2007). “Long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake is associated positively with corticolimbic gray matter volume in healthy adults.” Neuroscience Letters. 421(3):209-12 \xa0 Beltz, B. S., Tlusty, M. F., Benton, J. L., Sandeman, D. C. (2007). “Omega-3 fatty acids up regulate adult neurogenesis.” Neurogenesis Letters. \xa0 Zainuddin, M. S. A., & Thuret, S. (2012). “Nutrition, adult and hippocampal neurogenesis and mental health.” British Medical Bulletien. 103, 1, p.89-114. DOI:10.1093/bmb/Ids021. \xa0 Our brains are made up of about 60% fat; this is where the term “fathead” came from. The next time someone calls you a fathead, say thank you. DHA, one of the most important of the omega-3s, constitutes about 30% of the brains cerebral cortex. \xa0 Jockers. D. (2012). “Is your brain getting enough of this nutrient?” NaturalNews.com. (11/05/2012). \xa0 When you consume high quality fats you are continuously rebuilding your brains’ cellular structure. Omega-3s are the highest quality fats for brain development. \xa0 3) Green Tea. Green tea contains polyphenols, the most powerful of which is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a type of catechin. Green tea’s polyphenols have been shown to increase neurogenesis, BDNF levels, and to have strong health benefits ranging from cancer prevention to fat loss, plus cardiovascular benefits, immunity improvement, and glucose reduction. \xa0 (Aug 2012). Molecular Nutrition & Food Research. 56(8):1292-303. doi: 10.1002/mnfr.201200035. Epub 13 Jun 2012. \xa0 Wang, Y., Li, M., Xu, X., Song, M., Tao, H., Bai, Y. “Green Tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) promises neural progenitor cell proliferation and sonic hedgehog pathway activation during adult hippocampal neurogenesis.” \xa0 Goepp, J. (Apr 2008). “New research on the benefits of green tea.” Life Extension. \xa0 Yoo, K.Y., Choi, J. H., Hwang, I. K., Lee, C. H., Lee, S. O., Han, S. M., Shin, H. C., Kang, I. J., Won, M. H. (July 2010). “Epigallocatechin-3-gallate increases cell proliferation and neuroblasts in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in adult mice.” Phytotherapy Research. 24(7):1065-70. doi: 10.1002/ptr.3083. \xa0 Green tea has clear cognitive benefits and even improves working memory, which is one of the most difficult functions to increase. \xa0 Borgwardt, S., Hammann, F., Scheffler, K., Kreuter, M., Drewe, J., Beglinger, C. (Nov 2012). “Neural effects of green tea extract on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 66(11):1187-92. \xa0 Look for extracts standardized to at least 40% polyphenols, or even better, 98% polyphenols with 75% catechin and 45% ECGC. \xa0 [Page 65] \xa0 Keep in mind that green tea does have caffeine, so ideally you want to have it before 2pm, any later may interfere with quality of sleep. \xa0 4. Circumin. Circumin provides the yellow color in the curry spice turmeric. It has strong neurogenic effects. In addition it is a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compound. Aging populations who consume circumin show better cognitive performance. \xa0 Kim, S.K., Son, T. G., Park, H. R., Park, M., Kim, M. S., Kim, H. S., Chung, H. Y., Mattson, M. P., Lee, J. (23 May 2008). “Circumin stimulates proliferation of embryonic neural progenitor cells and neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus.” Journal of Biological Chemistry. 283(21):14497-505. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M708373200. Epub 24 Mar 2008. \xa0 Ng, T. P., Chiam, P. C., Lee, T., Chua, H. C., Lim, L., Kua, E. H. (1 Nov 2006). “Curry consumption and cognitive function in the elderly.” American Journal of Epidemiology. 164(9):898-906.

Diann worked for 20 years as a psychotherapist. She was also an adjunct faculty member with the USC School of Social Work, training graduate students to become therapists at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. She made the transition from psychotherapist to coach because she found coaching to be more successful at affecting real, positive change in her clients.\xa0 Diann saw far too many brilliant & capable women struggle with distractibility, procrastination, perfectionism, & self-doubt which held them back from expressing their gifts in the world. Many of them were diagnosed with anxiety or depression and had no idea that the underlying issue was actually ADHD, including Diann herself.\xa0 She is now on a mission to help other gifted, creative & entrepreneurial women of all ages, achieve their true potential through radical self-acceptance, leveraging their strengths & creating an ADHD friendly business and life.\xa0 Diann goes on to share:  Her definitions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and how CBT differs from cognitive behavioral coaching (CBC). The role of therapy vs. coaching How you can change your self-concept with CBC. How our thoughts, feelings, and actions determine our results   Who is a candidate for CBC/CBT? Who is not?\xa0 Whether therapy and CBT/CBC can be conducted at the same time Why asking better questions is so important to our sense of self-esteem.

CBT does not treat ADHD, but works to lessen how it impairs your life through symptoms like procrastination, time management, disorganization CBT educates ADHDers about their brain and why it is the way it is CBT, helps to\xa0  build workarounds manage negative expectations and emotions discover negative behaviors that interfere with your ability to live to your potential. CBT can look different for each patient because it’s set up to their individual needs   Learn where CBT came from and how what you’re saying to yourself can really affect your life: what jobs you’ll apply for, what relationships you’ll enter into, what risks you’re willing to take.\xa0  \xa0 Discover how the experience of growing up with ADHD, especially undiagnosed ADHD, can impact how you think, what you think about yourself, how you cope, your attitudes and your beliefs.\xa0 Learn how the lens that you see the world through definitely affects who we become.\xa0 \xa0 Discover how what you’re thinking can impact your life. And that:  Your thoughts create your feelings/emotions Your feelings create your actions Your actions create your results.\xa0 Everything starts with your thoughts.\xa0 How our thoughts are responsible for our emotions.\xa0  \xa0 Tracy states: “Don’t believe everything you think.” It doesn’t matter if you had that negative thought a million times. It’s not going to affect you now unless you think it again. You don’t have to undo those thoughts, you just have to break the pattern of the thought.   Tracy shares that CBT looks for where your thoughts are distorted and it has you question them.\xa0 \xa0 In CBT, you’re also learning how to use specific strategies for managing your ADHD like getting to work on time, starting a project you don’t want to do, sticking to your planner, building better relationships. \xa0 Discover what you should do when you can’t start a project or task. \xa0 Also learn CBT strategies around  Prioritization\xa0 Self-regulation Time management\xa0 Managing emotions Managing behavior\xa0 Procrastination  \xa0 Discover how CBT compares to medication and what kind of Cognitive Behavioral therapist you should hire.\xa0 \xa0 Resources: \xa0 https://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/2/6/7/267bd069eae25e78/54-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-adhd.mp3?c_id=7219930&cs_id=7219930&destination_id=142545&expiration=1564212868&hwt=0b2442c3018eabfd8c5b78b5e7d0bf1a \xa0 https://www.additudemag.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-adhd/ \xa0 https://next.podbay.fm/podcast/668174671/e/1415109600 \xa0 https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-Adult-ADHD-Dysfunction/dp/160918131X/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=cognitive+behavioral+therapy+adhd&qid=1564208885&s=gateway&sr=8-3 \xa0 https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-Adult-ADHD/dp/0415815916/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=cognitive+behavioral+therapy+adhd+russell+ramsay&qid=1564208985&s=gateway&sr=8-2 | For our 31st episode, Tracy invited Katelyn Mabry to join her. Katelyn is the author of the children’s book Hi, It’s Me! I have ADHD which is based on her personal history with ADHD. In her book she shares the feelings, emotions and experiences as a child dealing with the challenges of ADHD and offers them insights, tips empowerment and the message that ADHD does not define them. Katelyn has a master’s degree in reading and is a certified early childhood/special education teacher. She also has four children and is now a private coach for kids who learn differently. Katelyn’s goal is to instill the love of reading, learning and growing in her students.\xa0 Tracy talks about her 17 year old son who is very bright but came to her in December and said he couldn’t read. She saw him reading all the time so this didn’t make sense to her.\xa0\xa0 That’s when she remembered that there was a reading specialist in her ADHD for Smart Ass Women Facebook group named Katelyn Mabry. Tracy called Kately and she told her that Markus can read, he just can’t focus on what he’s reading when he’s not interested which means that he can’t retain what he reads. Tracy hired Katelyn to work with Markus and has been so pleased at how much more confidence her son has around reading in subjects that he is not interested in. She asked Katelyn to share some of the strategies she has used for her son around reading retention. Katelyn talks about metacognition and how she uses it to help kids retain what they are reading.\xa0 Learn about the three different types of inner voices in metacognition: reciting, conversational and interactive and which one helps retention the most by helping the reader connect to the characters. Kaitlyn then teaches us about the distracted voice and the way she helps students identify when the distracted voice shows up. Learn why visualization is so important in reading retention. Katelyn shares a fantastic quote which analogizes reading to driving a car. Learn what it means to activate background knowledge to aid in reading retention. What does it mean to give the reading purpose and why it’s so important that the reader to intentionally connect the reading to the reader’s worldview.\xa0 Katelyn mentions her book Hi, It’s Me! I Have ADHD. She is working on the second edition which will be released in October. If listeners would like to learn more about her book or connect with her they can subscribe to her email list at www.katelymabry.com.\xa0 Katelyn recommends the book  I Read It But I Don’t Get It: Comprehension Strategies for Adolescent Readers by Chris Tovani\xa0 Tracy mentioned the book  Learning How to Learn by Barbara Oakley | This week’s podcast is all about the Apple Watch and how I use it to manage my ADHD brain. I didn’t want an Apple Watch. I don’t want to wear anything that everyone else is wearing. That said, once I did, I realized just how valuable it could be to manage my ADHD brain. I feel more in control, less worried about things falling through the cracks, and more organized than I’ve ever felt. My whole goal has been to build structures around myself to shore up my weaknesses so I can focus on my strengths. I have basically uploaded my working memory to the Apple Watch.\xa0  When I first got the watch, I was totally overwhelmed. I looked everywhere for videos and blog posts, about how to use the Apple Watch to shore up the ADHD brain. I couldn’t find anything, so I’ve wanted to do this podcast for a while. That said, this is not an in-depth instruction manual on what the Apple Watch can do. This is just me talking to you about the best, simplest ways I have found to set up and use my Apple watch to build that structure around me that best supports my ADHD brain.  And this is the structure that has worked best for me:   ALARMS,\xa0TIMERS & REMINDERS\xa0-\xa0The number one reason I love the Apple Watch is for alarms. I no longer need to wash the laundry five times because I keep forgetting I’m doing the wash and get totally distracted by my work, my kids, my dog or another Donald Trump tweet ... YOU GET ME? With my Apple Watch, I can actually cook again because I don’t burn things anymore. I’m constantly reminded by Mr. Apple that I’m cooking! It took me awhile to figure this out, but this is what you need to know.   Your iPhone, and Apple Watch have alarms, reminders and timers. Your MacBook and iPad only have reminders built in. You only have one timer on your Apple Watch or iPhone. There are no multiple timers. Alarms and reminders have labels so you can remember what you were even working on. Timers do not, so when the timer goes off, if you’re anything like me, you won’t have a clue what you were even timing.\xa0 Haptic feedback is probably the best feature of the alarm on my Apple Watch. It’s the light tap on the top of your wrist that your watch administers, kind of like you’re own built-in nanny.\xa0 Both reminders and alarms allow you to use your voice to set up an alert, which I love.\xa0 I sleep with my watch, set weekly and weekend alarms and use the haptic feedback when the alarms go off every morning as my alarm clock.\xa0 Alarms don’t delete themselves like reminders, so you’ll have to delete them off your phone every other month or two. Instructions\xa0here. Alarms and timers that you set up on your Apple Watch will not show up anywhere else. Alarms and timers that you set up on your iPhone will show up on your watch. No idea why, I just know that they won’t.\xa0 If you need multiple countdown timers,\xa0this\xa0is the best I could find, but don’t bother adding the complication to your watch. Just use it on your phone.\xa0    FIND YOUR PHONE -\xa0If you too lose your phone at the store, your office or in the garden under layers of mulch (you’ll have to listen to the podcast ), this is reason alone to invest in the Apple Watch. You can use your watch to ping your phone. Even better, if you’re in the dark and you can’t find your phone, or you just want to know if it’s at the bottom of your bottomless purse, continue to press on the phone icon. The flash will light up and blink. Instructions are\xa0here.  FLASHLIGHT -\xa0I never used the flashlight on my iPhone. When I needed it, I was usually at a front door trying to hold groceries, a bag, a dog or all three. With your Apple Watch on your wrist, you can actually use it as a flashlight. This is perfect when you’re in the dark trying to put a key into a lock. Instructions\xa0here. SPOTIFY -\xa0I’m not a music person. I know… blasphemy, right? I just find it so distracting to all the brilliance trapped in my brain , but since I know that music affects emotion in a positive way I force myself to listen to it. The Apple Watch with the Spotify app makes this so easy that I actually use it. I put in my Apple wireless\xa0AirPods, click on my Spotify complication on my watch face and I’m automatically connect to my ADHD for Smart Ass Women\xa0playlist. The whole point of the playlist was to create an immediate go-to resource for positive, feel good, happy, upbeat music, and i have to tell you that it totally works. If I’m feeling even a little down, I start the playlist and within 5 minutes I feel 100% better. I created this playlist with the help of members of our\xa0ADHD for Smart Ass Women Facebook group. Join us.\xa0  Btw, I’m famous for putting things down and not knowing where I put them, and I knew my tiny little AirPods would be no exception, so I bought this\xa0Airpods Watch Band Holderfor the times I can’t immediately get my AirPods back in their case. PCALC -\xa0I have no idea why the iPhone calculator app doesn’t sync to the Apple Watch, but it doesn’t, and just like Barbie, I hate math. PCalc is the calculator on my wrist. It’s for conversions and calculations of all kinds from currency to tips to almost anything a scientist, engineer or student would need. It’s a bit pricey at $9.99 but it works.  WALKIE TALKIE -This feature of the Apple Watch is great for family communication. My daughter is going to school in NYC. We regularly ping each other using the Walkie Talkie for simple questions. My husband also loves when I harass him in the grocery store by constantly adding “one more thing” to our shopping list. This is one of my favorite features of the Apple Watch because it’s so quick. Instructions\xa0here.  WORLD CLOCK -\xa0Right now I have a teenager who’s traveling through Europe, a daughter in NYC and a VA in the Philippines. I am so bad at calculating anything, and that includes time. One of the best things I did was set my watch complications (apps that show up on your watch face) to include a world clock with all my time zones accessible right on my wrist. One click and one swipe and I know exactly when I should or shouldn’t call. Instructions\xa0here.  MAPS-One of the best apps built into the Apple Watch 4. The turn-by-turn navigation with haptic feedback is almost like having a friend sitting in the seat next to you saying, “turn right here.” Just remember to set your turn alert notifications on the watch app on your iPhone. Instructions\xa0here.  TILE- I am constantly leaving my purse behind. In truth I hate carrying a purse, so I often just carry a wallet. But because I don’t usually carry a purse, when I do I forget that I even have a purse with me. Well,\xa0Tile Matehelps. I added one to my wallet. You can use these Tiles on everything. You can hang them on your keys, stick them on your laptop, your iPad, your remote control; basically whatever you lose. You download the free\xa0TileApp\xa0and then you can ring your things with your phone. If I lose something and I’m too far to ping it, I can open up the Tile App on my Apple Watch or my iPhone and see where the last place was that I left it. There’s also a built in community that can help you find whatever you have a Tile App on.\xa0  BEAR- Right after I was diagnosed with ADHD, it suddenly dawned on me that I had a million notebooks but I never went back into any of them. The few times I had to find something I got so overwhelmed. I was never able to find anything so why take them? That’s when a friend told me about a simple app that came with my MacBook that I could write notes in and search for those notes later. For three years I’ve been a staunch Apple Notes fan. Then, I discovered Bear. It’s better than Apple Notes because:   It’s much cleaner, simpler, and more aesthetically pleasing, which is really important to my brain. Simple, beautiful, good design relaxes it. Clutter confuses it.\xa0 I love that I can tag everything. Apple Notes uses folders and often times I have trouble finding things because one note could be in a number of folders. Now I just tag my notes and I’m never worried that I might not be able to find the note when I need it.\xa0 Bear syncs with my Mmacbook, iPad, phone (which Apple Notes does as well), but it also syncs with my Apple Watch. I have the complication on my watch face, so wherever I am I can take a quick note using my voice. When I get to my laptop I can then organize it. It’s just really easy to get into and out of which is so important for the ADHD brain because when things are cumbersome we will not use them. It’s also intuitive, you can the most basic features and then add from there when you’re ready.\xa0 You can also add links in the document and export in every way imaginable. You can find Bear on all platforms\xa0here.   CHEATSHEET\xa0- Cheatsheet is for really simple notes (non-sensitive information that doesn’t need encryption). It’s a way to remember things you always forget. Things like logins, homework assignments, flight numbers, gate numbers, hotel room numbers. I’m redoing my son’s bedroom right now. All his room dimensions are stored in a Cheatsheet file with a baby icon (shhhh, don’t tell him!). When I’m in a paint or furniture store or even chatting with an online vendor, it is so easy to just click on the Cheatsheet complication on my Apple Watch and look for the baby icon that contains all the measurements I could ever need. Normally I would have measured his room and lost the dimensions at least four times by now. The key to any application for our ADHD brains is really how quickly you can get in and out of it because that’s the only way that we’ll muster up the patience to actually use it. If you’re going to use Cheatsheet make sure it’s one of the complications on your watch face. You can find Cheatsheet\xa0here.  \xa0 Here are the three additional Apple Watch apps that I mentioned in my podcast. I’m impressed with them thus far, but haven’t used them long enough to include on my list. I’ll report back later.\xa0  PocketCasts Audible Things3  If you have a great Apple Watch app that plays well with your ADHD brain, please let me know about it by emailing me at\xa0tracy@tracyotsuka.com.

These kinds of infections can be difficult to resolve whether you’re trying with herbs or with pharmaceutical agents, but don’t give up! With a few pointers and a solid plan, you can be successful working with herbs for athlete’s foot. The difference between success and failure often comes down to how you prepare and apply the herbs – that’s what this episode will teach you.Our favorite antifungal herbs are actually some of the most common – plants like garlic, oregano, turmeric, and willow. With common household items like salt and vinegar, they can be made into very potent herbal remedies to combat athlete’s foot. We like to come at the problem from a few angles at once, working with soaks, sprays, and salves to keep the fungi on their toes – and get them off of yours!(By the way, these remedies are also helpful if you’re dealing with thrush, ringworm, or related issues. We offer some tips for applying these herbs for athlete’s foot to other fungal skin infections like these, too.)Herbs discussed include: garlic, oregano / thyme / monarda, uva ursi, pau d’arco, black walnut, plantain, calendula, turmeric, henna, seaweeds, marshmallow, propolis, usnea, loosestrife, willow, barberry, oregon grape root, tea tree, rosemary, thuja, cinnamon, & chaparral.~Have you seen our newest online course offering?

We make a big batch every year around this time, when most of the plants that go into it are fresh and ready to harvest. They need about a month to extract fully into the elixir, so we can’t wait until we’re already sick to start putting our elixir together. Preparing it now means it’s ready for us when the first respiratory infection of the season strikes. Holistic herbalism means thinking ahead sometimes!Our herbal elixir is designed to be general-purpose, to cover all the most important bases. When you have a cold or the flu, you don’t only need to “kill” the virus. You also need to keep your inner waters flowing, help fevers be effective & efficient, maintain mucous membrane function, and provide your immune system with the support it needs to function optimally. From the marrow on outward, our winter elixir is a full-spectrum solution to respiratory infections.PS: If you don’t have all the ingredients we discussed in this episode, work with what you’ve got! Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 🙂 And remember that you can work with what the landscape gives you in your own bioregion – wherever you are, there are herbs that can do these jobs.Herbs discussed include: loosestrife, elderberry, ground ivy, mullein, boneset, sumac, goldenrod, st john’s wort, japanese knotweed, catnip, & blue vervain.If you want to learn more about how to manage cold & flu with herbs and holistic strategies, our newest online course is for you!

She recently completed her new book The Prisoner’s Herbal, which Katja helped edit and which we’re going to help distribute in the US.We talked about how Nicole’s personal experience of finding support from wild plants during her own incarceration shaped her work as an organizer and as an herbalist, the sad state of healthcare and nutrition in prisons, why herbalists should care about what happens to prisoners, what prison abolition really means and how we can move as a society in that direction, and how we can all support and care for incarcerated people in ways large and small.To get your own copy of The Prisoner’s Herbal and support the work Nicole is doing, visit:Solidarity ApothecaryAlso mentioned in this episode:IWOC – Incarcerated Workers Organizing CommitteeBlack Permaculture NetworkSolitary GardensIf you’d like to help us keep our incarcerated students initiative moving forward, while also supporting out podcast, free clinics, scholarships, and other projects – and get some goodies for your generosity – we’d very much appreciate it!

Thank you!!Our theme music is “Wings” by Nicolai Heidlas.Support the show | Where does loosestrife belong? Is barberry a badberry? And what’s with all the knotweed everywhere?! Most folks will tell you it’s simple: “These are invasive plants. They’re bullies, who take over an area and crowd out “native” plants! They need to be pulled out, root and branch! No use for ’em – not a good seed in the lot!” … Whew. If that were true, there’d be no such thing as medicinal\xa0invasive plants – but we’re here to tell you, there is such a thing. Many such, actually!In this episode we’ll tell you all about three of our favorite “invasive” herbs in our part of the world: purple loosestrife, Japanese knotweed, and barberry (European and Japanese varieties). We’ll explore each one’s medicinal virtues and specific talents, drawing insights from historical & traditional practice, phytochemistry, and our own experiences working with these plants to solve problems and improve health.In the process, we’ll work to challenge some of the underlying assumptions in the standard narrative about invasive plants. Too often, this concept is predicated on unexamined biased assumptions about what it means to be “native” and what it means to be otherwise. The truth is, plants aren’t native to geography, they’re native to ecology. As the environment changes, the places plants live must change too. Thinking differently about invasives can help us better understand and relate to our changing world.Herbs discussed include purple loosestrife, Japanese knotweed, barberry, & autumn olive.Also mentioned in this episode:Where Do Camels Belong?, Ken ThompsonHow Wolves Change Rivers1491, Charles MannInvasive Plant Medicine, Tim ScottIf you’re a regular listener, by now you’ve heard us talk about our podcast supporters – and maybe you’re wondering how to become one, yourself!

When an herb has a sweet flavor, that gives you information about the way it will affect the body. These herbs tend to be moistening, building, and restorative. They’re great for correcting dry, atrophied, or depleted states of health, whether those are constitutional tendencies or the result of an illness or injury.In this episode we discuss a handful of our favorite sweet herbs. Each one has its own particular talents, but we can also see the consistent aspects of their medicines that can be traced back to their “sweet principles”. Even a little basic phytochemistry helps us understand why these taste sweet and how to best work with them. We also talk about sweet delivery methods like elixirs, electuaries, and herb-infused honey.Don’t let sweet stop at sugar!Herbs discussed include fennel, cinnamon, jiaogulan, codonopsis, goji, licorice, stevia, & astragalus.Our We’re All In This Together sale is still running!

If you’re a regular listener, you know we’re very interested in science and in the historical & traditional ways of working with plants. But there’s a side of plant medicine we don’t talk about too often, and that’s the spiritual & ritual side. The truth is, we do actually think a lot about these elements when we work with herbs! But perhaps not in the way you might expect… and that’s where herbal awareness rituals come in.What we like best is to present a method for working with or taking the herbs in a manner that has ritualistic aspects. By stepping aside from the hustle & bustle of life, taking a moment to engage all your senses and all your attention & intention with the remedy, you enhance its effects manyfold. It is truly astounding how much this kind of practice enhances the work of the plants.An herbal awareness ritual can be presented to the client, or person asking for help, in a variety of ways. Some of these will emphasize the “rational” aspects of ritual, drawing insights from the science of the placebo effect and deep psychology; others will emphasize the “magical” aspects, connecting to spiritual and religious traditions or experiences. Being fluent in all these languages is very helpful for an herbalist. We consider it an important clinical skill to be able to find ways to present a ritual practice to someone in the way they can accept.All this & more in this episode!Well, we’re halfway through July, so that means our We’re All In This Together sale is half over!

So many people rely on it as part of their morning ritual, and it’s easy to see why! The aroma, the flavor, the stimulation – there’s a lot to like.

As president of two companies, Exceptional Water Systems and Pure Vision Technologies, his vision, belief and teaching, is to continually improve water quality for all aspects of life. Michael has dedicated his time and energy in researching water, down to the quantum physics level by working with scientists, biochemical engineers, water treatment specialists and doctors from all over the country. Michael started his journey in 2005 where he began his pursuit and passion for water for a local commercial pool and spa distributor. During that time, he learned that fully understanding water was the key to success in the aquatics industry. After a few short years he became a Certified Pool Instructor. Having the opportunity to share his knowledge about water quality, hydraulics, safety, and a little influence from his friends and family, drove Michael to start Exceptional Water Systems. After two short years of special research and development, Michael then founded Pure Vision Technologies, a company devoted to manufacturing and developing new technologies to deliver the highest level of water quality possible by utilizing only natural elements like oxygen, ozone, and UV. His intentions were to utilize natural elements for water treatment to provide not only a safe environment while in and around aquatic environments, but also after the water has been used.

After his enlistment was up, he went on to graduate from the University of Phoenix with a degree in marketing.

I love them because they are at the heart of creating a truly fulfilled and magical life, and that\'s what I\'m playing for. But I hate them because when I\'ve felt I\'ve lacked any or all of them, I judged myself so harshly.\xa0 \xa0 In today\'s episode I\'m talking about the difference between purpose, vision and passion, how they interact with one another, and why they\'re key ingredients to having it all.

Are you feeling imbalanced and burnt out with work constantly, AND are you making excuses about why you are unable to establish and hold those boundaries? \xa0 I know the feeling of struggling with holding boundaries. The fear of saying "no", of telling someone you\'re unavailable, of turning your phone off at night because "what if I miss something important?". \xa0 All those thoughts are real, and they are all also major contributors to having zero work boundaries. \xa0 In this episode I explore how to create and hold boundaries at work, even if you\'re starting from the ground floor. \xa0 Links: https://www.matthewbivens.com/balance-ebook/ | What do you do when you\'re feeling imbalanced, burnt out and overwhelmed? \xa0 Feeling imbalanced is just a part of life.

And the final product is called copy.\xa0 \xa0 It’s the written text on billboards, websites, emails, social media, advertisements, etc. \xa0 This copy should ultimately persuade your ideal client to buy your product, book a call, or whatever action you want them to take. \xa0 I friggin’ LOVE writing copy. \xa0 And you need to as well. \xa0 \xa0 Because storytelling sells. \xa0 \xa0 If you\'re not selling yourself or the products you are offering, it’s most likely because you’re copy is BORING. \xa0 Yep. I just said that. \xa0#SorryNotSorry. \xa0  It doesn’t mean YOU are boring. \xa0It just means your copy might suck. \xa0 \xa0 But don\'t worry if you feel like that might be you! Everything is figureoutable with the right knowledge.\xa0 \xa0 Which is why I\'m interviewing copywriter and storytelling extraordinaire,\xa0Keli Chevalier\xa0on today\'s episode!  Keli is a gifted StorySeller, and she\'s so much fun to listen to! I can\'t wait for you to hear today\'s episode. |  |  | Over the last decade, maybe you’ve noticed this new thing (honestly, I’d have to question whether you’re actually alive in 2019 if you haven’t noticed it) called the Digital Course. Online learning isn’t really new, but anyone being able to create a course is kinda new.\xa0 \xa0 It seems like everyone really does have a course. Your dog probably even has one so he can teach other dogs how to fetch their owners’ Kindles. \xa0 I friggin’ love digital courses. \xa0 I remember the first one I took. It was with the Institute for Integrative Nutrition and it was what inspired me to become a Health Coach. At that time, I was looking for ways to get in control of my own health.\xa0 \xa0 It was exactly what I needed in my life then and it’s part of what put me on the trajectory that’s landed me here today… writing this post to you about digital courses. #meta \xa0 But hey, my point is not to travel down memory lane. My point is to get you to think of something you may have not yet considered (or maybe you think you’re not cut out to do… you’re wrong, btw): \xa0 Open your mind to the possibility that, in this information-hungry world we live in, maybe you have a message that needs to be turned into a course. \xa0 I talk a lot about your potential in your biz, about how overcoming your limiting beliefs can unlock your success, and how you can totally create the life you want. \xa0 But what does all of that mean if you don’t have a tool to make it happen? \xa0 Here’s your tool: spread your wisdom (and make some money) by creating a digital course that you can sell over and over again.\xa0 \xa0 I’ve created a few online courses so I’ve got some nuggets in today\'s episode that you’re gonna wanna note as to why I think this could be your next big break. \xa0 And if you\'re ready to jump in with both feet now, I\'ve got a special treat for you! | Before I was a dōTERRA anything, I worked at a health club teaching Pilates and yoga. \xa0 I was a little more than just a teacher, though. \xa0 I was the Mind Body Coordinator and that meant I was managing 35 other teachers and 105 classes on the schedule in addition to teaching my own classes... like the badass I am 😉 \xa0 I loved it. Not just because my classes were always the ones fully booked, but because it was an environment in which I thrived. \xa0 During this time, though, I was growing... personally and professionally. I hadn’t ever really thought about building a “personal brand” (as we like to call it now) but in retrospect, that is exactly what I was doing. \xa0 One day I had a lightbulb moment. I realized the reason I was so popular as a teacher was because I was attracting people who wanted to hear what I had to say. \xa0 #dominoeffect. \xa0It was the ah-ha turning point for me.\xa0 \xa0 It wasn’t coconut cream and raw cacao though for all. My potential to grow made other people uncomfortable. \xa0 Mainly my boss (oops). \xa0 So today on the podcast I\'m telling you the story about that one time I got fired...and what I did about it! | Have you ever been stuck in a rut? \xa0 *Hands Up* I know I have. \xa0 It’s really easy to fall into the “Comfortable” trap. \xa0 Because let’s face it, the other “C” word can be pretty scary. That’s right: Change. \xa0 Are you living a life on autopilot because it’s comfy? And “just enough” or “getting by” is good enough for you? \xa0 Screw that. You all deserve so much more. And I’m not singling you out.\xa0 \xa0 I literally talk to HUNDREDS of people throughout my journeys, webinars, conferences and meetings every single year about how if YOU want to change your current situation, no one is going to do it but YOU. \xa0 Because of that, I\'ve been looking forward to today\'s episode for MONTHS.\xa0 \xa0 My guest is Jessie Reimers, a doTERRA\'s youngest Presidential Diamond and a total friggin go getter. Her story will inspire you into action...I can pretty much guarantee it.\xa0 \xa0 This is one of those "Don\'t Miss" interviews! | Photography is one of the most critical parts of my brand. \xa0 Whatever I put out into the world on my Instagram, website, emails, blogs...it has to accurately represent my brand. And it’s gotta look goooood. \xa0 You wouldn’t leave the house with rollers in your hair or your makeup half done, so don’t put anything out into the world that you’re not super proud of either. \xa0 When it comes to personal brand photography, just like your written copy, it’s all about storytelling and converting your audience into paying customers. \xa0 Your personal brand photos need to visually tell YOUR story and look aesthetically pleasing. \xa0 On the podcast today I have my own lifestyle photographer,\xa0Jenn Hernandez.\xa0 \xa0 Jenn is a brand expert, a photography master, and so much fun to listen to.\xa0 \xa0 And if you love this interview with Jenn as much as I have, you\'re in luck!\xa0  Because she’s speaking at my event,\xa0Consciously Creating Your Whole You Live Experience, this November 16th in Boulder Colorado.  The theme of the event this year is centered on learning how to understand and communicate with people outside of my OWN generation. You know, you’ve heard of most of them right? \xa0The Silent Generation? Baby Boomers? Gen X, Gen Y, Millennials?  For example, how do I communicate with my team, who are all millennials, and help them understand and implement my vision for my business.  Or how do I sell to someone like my mom, who doesn’t trust the internet, when most of my business is based online.  This marketing strategy that I call called Generationally Authentic Storytelling.  It is an organized format that follows a sales process and deeply indoctrines your audience no matter what age and allows you to enroll them into working with you, joining your membership or buying your product with a lot less resistance. \xa0  Because you are communicating with them the way that their generation hears and processes information.  I’ve become so fascinated by this way of Marketing and communicating to different generations that I’ve decided to make it the theme of my 2nd Annual Consciously Creating Your Whole You Live Experience Event.  And I’m so excited to invite you to join me November 16th, 2019 in Boulder Colorado for a day of learning to communicate with your ideal customer across generational lines.  Tickets are on sale now over for only $247, which is a $50 discount. | This summer I’ve noticed that I’ve deviated from own wellness routine a few times because I’ve been busy or tired or off my schedule, and it really does make a difference in how my body feels and functions.\xa0 \xa0 So I decided that I’m finally ready to dedicate an entire episode on my show to talk about my wellness regime and the specific products I use to keep my body healthy so that I can play and work as hard as possible. \xa0 We only get one body. \xa0And it’s definitely not getting any younger. \xa0 I work hard every day to stay healthy...on the inside and the outside. \xa0 We talk A LOT about different tactics to consciously create the life and biz of our dreams and a lot of it has to do with our mental game.\xa0 \xa0 But our body is our vehicle.\xa0 \xa0 It houses our amazing thoughts and ideas, feelings and emotions...it’s what gets us through this crazy journey we call life.\xa0 \xa0 I want to help you make the most out of YOUR gorgeous bod.\xa0 \xa0 So I’m going to share with you how I take care of mine on today\'s episode. | When it comes to consciously creating a life you love, it starts with taking control of your health.  That body of yours is the vehicle on this epic life journey and you gotsta take care of it.  It shouldn’t be a chore either...taking care of your health should be fun!  And it all begins with an invisible inner force that dictates our mood, energy levels, weight, and so much more. You guessed it... hormones.  Resetting those haywire hormones is the key to losing weight and boosting your energy naturally.  You don’t have to heal your hormones with more...hormones.  You can balance them using powerful essential oils and developing a self-care practice. Yup. It’s that easy.  I love anything that involves incorporating simple daily habits...we have enough stress on our plates.  So let me take this one thing off your plate.  Weight loss can be a touchy subject...but it doesn\'t have to be! There are experts like me guest on this episode, Dr. Mariza Snyder who make natural weight loss simple and effective without all the added baggage.  Listen to the episode you\'ll see what I mean! | I was just having this conversation with my biz bestie… \xa0 Why do entrepreneurs just drop their biz in the summer months and then complain about how hard it is to make sales when school starts in the fall?\xa0 \xa0 For realz.\xa0 \xa0 Yes it’s summer. \xa0But my biz can still be equal parts coconut dreamsicles and power presentations. \xa0 \xa0 On today’s episode, get the secrets to balance summer bliss and business growth without taking your laptop to the beach. (that’s so lame) \xa0 Because what\'s the point of summer if you can\'t play hard...and what\'s the fun in playing if you aren\'t healthy enough to enjoy it?', 'chan_desc': 'Hayley Hobson is an internationally known author, life coach and inspirational speaker.

With our Fab Fertile Coaching method, we take a functional approach to fertility. Looking at the other symptoms in the body.

Studies have found even drinking as few as 4 alcoholic drinks per week - decreases IVF live birth rate. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4487775/ Alcohol has been shown to decrease the quality, quantity, and motility of sperm.  It takes 90 days for the egg to renew and the life cycle of the sperm is 70-80 days. Stopping a minimum of 3 months prior to conception. It can also impact ovulation. Making it difficult to conceive. Plus there is no safe amount of alcohol in pregnancy.  We'll discuss how you and your partner can quit drinking to maximize your preconception health. Plus how to deal with societal pressures to drink and how to be social while sober.  --  Registration for Mindfulness Fertility Series Closes Today - Sept 23rd - this course is only offered 2x/year.

In this podcast, I’m going to inform you how to do this without using a spreadsheet.\xa0 It can also involve finding ways to earn more and I cover this as well.The Barefoot Investor book by Scott Pape has been a game-changer in helping me save an extra $500 a month.\xa0 If you’re ready to spend less than you earn and take charge of your financial future, then this podcast is for you.Resources Mentioned in this PodcastBarefoot Investor Bookhttps://selfhelpforlife.com/barefoot-investor | Last month (July 2019), I recorded and published my 50th video on YouTube.\xa0 It was around the time of my birthday, so I celebrated my birthday and creating 50 YouTube videos with a lovely long weekend in Hamilton Island.I felt that this would be a great time to reflect on what I have learned from creating 50 YouTube videos.\xa0 A big part of this was developing a number of success habits and mindset shifts that enabled me to achieve this goal.These are the same success habits and mindset shifts that will help you achieve success in almost anything that you put your mind to.So in this podcast, I will cover 9 key things that I learned from creating 50 YouTube videos. \xa0 I provide examples on how you could apply what I have learned to other areas of your life including health, fitness, reducing stress and anxiety.Resources mentioned in this podcastMy E-Mail list and Ten Strategies for Your Success free eBookhttps://selfhelpforlife.com/successJudy – My Virtual Assistanthttps://www.linkedin.com/in/judy-morcilla-factor-63aa2b106/https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~011c6543e92beb78b2\xa0 | Most successful people will tell you that a burning desire for success is absolutely critical to achieving your goals and dreams. It is the fuel that propels you forward and gives you the motivation to take action and get results.But how do you develop a burning desire for success? Well, this is what this podcast is all about. The most important thing to realize is that it is a learnable skill. It’s true that some people seem to naturally have a burning desire to make things happen. However, if you don’t have this fire in your belly, there are things that you can do to develop this burning desire inside you.In this podcast, you will discover the 7 best ways to create a burning desire for success.\xa0 Learn and apply these and notice that fire in your belly developing and giving you the desire and motivation that you need to achieve your goals. | Understanding the four different types of energy is crucial to learning how to master your energy on a daily basis.The four energies are physical, mental, emotional and spiritual and they work in fundamentally different ways.To master your energy, it is important to realize that all four of these energies are finite and will become depleted over time. This is why it is so important to make time to take breaks and to rest and recover.In this podcast, you will discover how to master your energy by understanding these 4 different types of energy and how they can work together to fuel your success. | Understanding the difference between rich and wealthy people is super important, especially if you would like to master how you make and spend money.Get it wrong and you will struggle when you’re older or when the economy is in recession. The quality of your life is massively affected by the quality of your decisions about money.Knowing the difference between rich and wealthy people will help you make the right money decisions, so that you can get ahead financially in your life.When you really get the difference between rich and wealthy people, your life will change for the better. What would it be like to not worry about money, because you know that there is always enough available?This might seem like a pipe-dream, but it is truly possible, and this podcast will get you started in the right direction. | It’s absolutely essential that you truly understand why you get what you focus on. It’s such a fundamental component to all success and positive personal change. I can’t emphasize this enough!When you really get this, the way you think will never be quite the same again. The key reason that you get what you focus on lies in how your brain learns. It learns by focus and repetition. Think about how you learnt things in the past? I’m sure focus on the skill and repetition had a part to play.However, when it comes to thinking and imagining, we often focus on what we don’t want.\xa0 We think about the worse possible outcome. I believe that this is primarily due to fear.It doesn’t have to be this way. When you learn why you get what you focus on and how your brain really works, you will be able to nip these old ways of thinking and imagining in the bud.\xa0Life then gets easier, with less internal conflicts and greater peace and happiness.The technical aspects of neuroplasticity came from this article.https://www.heysigmund.com/why-what-you-focus-on-is-what-becomes-powerful-why-your-thoughts-and-feelings-matter/Here is the link to Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz on Amazonhttps://selfhelpforlife.com/psycho-cybernetics', 'chan_desc': "Paul Thomas from the Self Help for Life blog shares the best ideas, concepts, strategies and techniques to help you master your mindset, emotions, health, business, finances and spirituality.

She is passionate about her relationship with food. Her brand JSHealth stands for finding balance and freedom with food. [01:28] Jessica was trapped in the fad diet world for years. Diets associated with restriction and deprivation always backfire. These create a vicious cycle where you have a really complicated relationship with food. There is another way to achieve a healthy life. [02:33] How disordered eating came about in Jessica\'s life. She started fad dieting at 14 and continued for 10 years. She developed an eating disorder and disconnected with her body. She developed fear and anxiety about her weight. [03:29] Jessica studied nutrition and started a blog about her journey of becoming a more whole foods and balanced eater. She slowly started to heal her relationship with food. She also went to therapy and discovered recipes that made her feel good. [05:21] The blog began as a personal journal. Her husband said she should make the blog live and use it as a tool to get new patients. Women will relate to the incredibly open and vulnerable story. She made the blog live six months after starting her writing, and she got 20,000 visitors. The positive feedback was motivating. [08:02] She began coaching and really got to see what women were going through in real life. The blog took off and she doesn\'t practice in the clinic anymore, but she loves her larger platform. [10:38] Jessica believes in a balanced moderation approach that is completely realistic to every person\'s life. None of the advice is unattainable. [13:06] How restrictive diets are so hard to stick to over the long term. Many people can\'t go past three to six months. Then they start binging or obsessing about food. They are just not sustainable. [16:03] How we are all so chemically unique. We have to think about what diet works best for our bodies and stop disconnecting and listening to all of the diet advice that doesn\'t fit our unique selves. We know best.

She is the creator of Kale in the Clouds and has an amazing instagram account. Today, we will be talking about healthy travel tips and how Rosie takes care of herself while being 33,000 feet in the air.In this episode of the Clean Eating for Women podcast, we talk about: \xa0  How being a flight attendant has allowed Rosie to get out of her comfort zone Rosie’s balanced approach to food and life How Rosie started listening to her body, changed her mindset, and eats foods that make her feel good  Some highlights of this episode on Healthy Travel Tips with Kale in the Clouds Creator Rosie Tran:  Four years ago, Rosie was asked to be her best friends Maid of Honor. Rosie decided to eat clean and focus on eating mostly veggies. This began her clean eating wellness journey. She started with a restrictive plant based route, but soon learned that balance was necessary. [03:39] \xa0 Prep is so important, because then it will be there when it is needed. It\'s hard to find time to put meals together. Having things premade helps so much. [05:19] Amazing food prep for the plane and hotel rooms. She got a little skillet, because some hotels don\'t offer microwaves. She would bring a spiralizer and heat zucchini in her room. This has made her job more fun. \xa0[08:05] Self-care. Rosie was so excited about every bit of her job. She worked a lot and made sure she was seeing everything on her layovers. Eventually, she realized she needed to slow down, take care of her body, and get the sleeps she needs. Slow down and don\'t have an agenda. Go after a good workout. [10:26] Rosie\'s best memories revolve around people and meeting unintentional friends. The importance of connection and in-person relationships. [12:56] Meal prepping. Mason jar salads. So easy to pop lid off and throw in dressing. Pre Packed salads and meals, plus the ingredients for other meals for longer trips. Filling meals don\'t require snacking. Bars, chips, chocolate, and fruit are great snacks. [16:51] Flight attendants don\'t have liquid restrictions. Being a flight attendant is such a cool job. The travel and flexibility is amazing. The importance of pursuing your true happiness and when work isn\'t work. [22:06] Rosie loves going to Hawaii. She gets to go there once a month. She now has enough seniority to pick where she flies to. Maui is her favorite. She loves the good weather and she is off to LA today.

He is a research microbiologist that has been in the industry for 16 years. He has promised to educate us today about spore based probiotics in a way that is easy to understand. rIn this episode of the Clean Eating for Women podcast, we talk about: \xa0  Kiran gives us a probiotic overview We learn what spore based probiotics are 80% of our immune system exists in our gut  Some highlights of this episode on Probiotics for Healing with Just Thrive Microbiologist Kiran Krishnan:  Kiran\'s super power is that he is a nerd that can talk to humans. He is going to explain some complicated topics in an easy to understand and "digestible" way. I heard Kiran on another podcast and knew he would be a great guest for the show. [01:13] Probiotics were first invented by Elie Metchnikoff. He put forth the idea that illness comes from an overabundance of bad bacteria. Auto intoxication. Using good bacteria to counteract bad bacteria. [02:11] A probiotic should be a live microorganism. It\'s a bacteria of some sort that can get into your system and make significant and valuable changes to the rest of the population in your digestive system and immune system. [03:17] If we have the right type of bacteria in our gut, we can create a significant amount of value in the way our body and our immune system functions. A probiotic is a good bacteria that goes to work for you fixing damage that we have done to our microbiome. [04:08] Things that can damage our microbiome can be too much sugar or taking antibiotics. We are a collection of thousands of organisms that work together as a whole. Our modern environment disrupts the cycle. Preservatives, pesticides, herbicides, glyphosate, chlorine, fluoride, and 80% of our personal care products destroy our bodies bacterial cultures. [04:52] Spore based probiotics form an endospore to protect themselves. They can survive in stomach acid. Then in the gut, they recondition the environment. They find bad bacteria and kill them off and feed the good bacteria through prebiotic foods. [11:33] Leaky gut is what is driving chronic inflammation that is driving chronic disease. Endotoxins leak through the intestinal lining and get into your bloodstream. This sets off inflammation and starts the process of disease. Obesity, brain fog, anxiety, depression, Alzheimer\'s, Parkinson\'s, cancer, and autoimmune diseases are all caused by toxins leaking from the gut. [19:42] Spore based probiotics are able to stop leaky gut in 30 days. It can help heal and reverse the entire condition. Metabolic endotoxemia is the process of digestion increasing intestinal leakiness. [25:59] The vast majority of the body can heal if we put it in a healing state. We can\'t be in a healing state with a continuous flood of toxins and inflammation just from eating food.

She is the creator and host of the PCOS Diva website and podcast. She has a new book out called Healing PCOS: A 21-Day Plan for Reclaiming Your Health and Life with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, and she is here today to share her healing philosophies with us.  In this episode of the Clean Eating for Women podcast, we talk about: \xa0  What is PCOS Amy’s healing journey Principles of healing PCOS  Some highlights of this episode on how to make veggies taste delicious:  How Carrie manages her PCOS symptoms with diet and lifestyle. A lot of women are frustrated with their doctors PCOS advice. Common symptoms like fatigue, hair loss, depression, and anxiety. Amy experienced many of these symptoms, but wasn\'t getting a lot of help. [01:22] Doctors were giving Amy a lot of strange pharmaceutical drugs. She finally went to a reproductive endocrinologist and got a PCOS diagnosis. She was 31 when she was diagnosed. It took 15 years to get her diagnosis. [04:45] Amy wants to give women the knowledge to empower themselves, and be diva\'s at the doctors office. After the birth of her second son, she was exhausted all the time. Mainstream advice wasn\'t helping. She decided to take control of her health. [05:50] Amy spent countless hours scouring online and reading books about PCOS. She started experimenting with diet and realized as she ordered at a restaurant that she was a diva. This was an aha moment, because she realized that she had to be a diva to take the best care of herself. [07:58] The three main factors of PCOS are insulin resistance, blood sugar issues, and elevated androgens. Start with managing your blood sugar better. Amy actually used a glucometer to understand how food was making her feel. Eating to keep her blood sugar levels in check really helped. [11:42] She started eating an anti-inflammatory diet with a lot of vegetables, clean animal protein, and water. She also took supplements and eight healthy fats. This helped get her hormones in balance, and it made her feel a lot better. [13:03] Women with PCOS are at an increased risk of blood clots by being on the pill. It can also increase insulin resistance and exacerbate mood disorders. It lowers libido and creates nutrition deficiency. [15:47] Amy started reading PubMed articles and finding ways to decrease her blood sugar. She would use things like apple cider vinegar. Her lab work showed that what she was doing was actually working. She also started blogging about it in 2009. She feels it is her calling to help women heal from PCOS. She went back to school to become a health coach. [18:24] Amy\'s book is a lifestyle plan. It talks about symptoms of PCOS and gives an overview. Then it jumps into the three tenets of being a diva. Thinking like a diva and changing your mindset. Then eating like a diva, moving like a diva, preparing for success to start the 21-day plan.

We don’t hold anything back, and talk about breast augmentation, lipo, tummy tucks, mommy makeovers, breast explants, and answer your questions from Instagram. It’s a juicy episode and I hope you love this one!  Here’s what we talk about: - Why plastic surgery isn’t for everyone - Our experiences with plastic surgery - How to find a great surgeon - Weird things that have happened - Non-permanent options, like Botox - Recovery tips and so. much. more.\xa0 A note: It’s important to be in a good mental space before you get any type of plastic surgery. Know that getting a physical attribution “fixed” isn’t going to fix any insecurities, turmoil, or heal any grief you may be experiencing. I also fully believe that you can be at a place where you love yourself, love your body, but still have some things you’d like to change or fix. They don’t have to be mutually exclusive. We both have a “you do you” attitude when it comes to plastic surgery, so I hope you listen to this one with an open mind. I’m sharing an episode about plastic surgery because it’s a very popular option for aesthetic and functional purposes. I wanted to share our experiences and also give tips for picking an awesome, safe surgeon and recovering in a safe way. Also, I have to admit that it was super fun to gab with my best friend for a while. ;) (You’ll be able to see why we complement each other so well. We’re opposites but in the best way.) A little bit about Betsy if you haven’t met her yet: I’m a busy mom of two crazy, adorable boys. I am a mom of an ADHD/ Anxious child, which in itself constantly presents me with unique curve balls! I work hard everyday to fight my own anxiety and body acceptance issues, while striving to be the best mom, friend, wife, version as me possible. My intention with my blog is to give you 100% real Betsy, the good the bad, the flab, and the fab. And in turn, you can give yourself 100% realness too. Because, honey, it is OK to be exactly who you are! My mission is to build a safe community for all of us women to live our truth even if it’s not always pretty!

In her early 20's she was introduced to chiropractic, whereas she had been very skeptical until it changed her life. The treatment was like magic - she felt new and light, like a better version of herself. She immersed herself in school, learning not only the art and science of chiropractic modalities, but also functional blood chemistry analysis, nutrition, applied kinesiology and natural remedies. She now specializes in difficult functional medicine cases, helping people with issues concerning their thyroid, blood sugar, gut health and hormone dysfunction as well as other metabolic conditions.  Dr. Barter went to Chiropractic school at the University of Western States in Portland, Oregon, but when she found out her mother was diagnosed with late stage cancer they moved to Colorado to fulfill her mother’s dream and she opened her first practice.\xa0 These days Dr. Barter can be found dancing, skiing, running, practicing yoga, biking, hiking, practicing barre or walking her Rhodesian Ridgeback, Ritz.

I’m thrilled to welcome\xa0P. Bredon Lundberg\xa0to the show today to talk about something extremely prevalent and sometimes misunderstood: pain.\xa0 How big is the chronic pain problem? What’s the difference between acute and chronic pain? Doesn't pain mean something is wrong? And the brain’s incredible ability to change its perception of pain in the body.  Here’s a little bit about Brendon: P. Brendon Lundberg, a previous chronic pain suffer, co-founded\xa0Radiant Pain Relief Centres, along with David Farley, MD, a Harvard-MIT trained physician, with a vision to build the safest, most consistently effective and appealing solution to the epidemic of chronic pain. Combining a mission to change the way chronic pain is understood treated with deep experience in healthcare management, marketing, business development and sales, Brendon and Dr. David Farley opened Radiant Pain Relief Centres in Portland, Oregon, USA, in February 2014. Following the success of the first center, they are laying out a plan for expansion to open new centers in new markets nationally and internationally. Their story and vision for the future of pain management can be understood by reading their book, Radiant Relief – A Case For A Better Solution To Chronic Pain. Previous to founding Radiant, Brendon played key operational and business development roles for two Portland-Area Portland Business Journal and Inc. Magazine Growth Award winning companies, and was the Director of Sales and Marketing for another Portland-based medical device start-up. Brendon holds a BS in business marketing and an MBA. \xa0 Some of the things we discuss in this episode: What is the latest scientific understanding of pain and why more doctors or therapies aren't utilizing this recent science Neuroplasticity and the brain’s potential to learn and change How Radiant's Scrambler Therapy works Does changing the brain's perception of pain create more risk? Brendon also gives some incredible insight on cultivating happiness, improving productivity, and his entrepreneurial journey\xa0 \xa0 Resources from this episode: Radiant Relief The Radiant Relief book Connect with\xa0Brendon on Instagram Brendon Burchard high performance academy\xa0 If you’re working out at home this summer or traveling,\xa0click here\xa0to get 21 days FREE of Les Mills On Demand.\xa0 Thank you so much for listening and for all of your support with the podcast!

What do you say? How do you explain this medicine if you only have a short amount of time?Let me share with you how I answer the question. It’s actually easier than you think. | Sometimes a mom needs a whole lot of moxie — especially when she and her family have gone through many different kinds of pain. This week’s podcast features a mom who has experienced much success with homeopathy. | Before we end our relaunch of my course, Skin, The Ugly Truth, I really wanted to chat with you a bit about a recent bout of skin eruptions I experienced. I was miserable until I found the precise remedy, but then, as usual, homeopathy performed spectacularly! | This week’s Mom with Moxie went through so much with her young son. Despite seeing numerous doctors, she couldn’t get a definitive diagnosis of his life-altering illness. He suffered — the whole family suffered — for a few years with no answers.Then she found homeopathy. | Today I’d like you to meet a mother/daughter duo that is doing just that … learning homeopathy together and sharing it with their family, friends and now, sharing their passion for homeopathy through study groups. | Many of you have expressed interest in what my experience entailed.

Transformation also depends upon the significant modification of the unconscious structures that shape and control ego-consciousness at the beginning of analysis, a change that takes place through the constellation of archetypal structures and dynamics in the interactive field between analyst and analysand" (Stein, 1995, p. 33). | JUNG PODCAST#30 - ANALYSIS 1In this episode I begin to discuss the central idea of the practice of Analytical Psychology, that of Jungian Analysis. Before I delve into the topic, I discuss why people come to analysis, and what happens in the first hour. I focus on Murray Stein\'s definition of analysis : “Jungian psychotherapists hold the notion of psychological development, of ‘stages of life’, and we ask ourselves questions about the levels of psychological development demonstrated in the narratives offered by the people who come to us. Does a person’s discourse show a good match, we wonder for instance, between chronological age and psychological attitudes? The full clinical impression of a person’s level or degree of psychological development takes many sessions and much observation to formulate in depth and detail. It is an estimate of their achieved individuation. Individuation is a term used to indicate a person’s potential for full psychological development. In its simplest formula, individuation is the capacity for a wholeness and evolved consciousness. The aim of analysis is to increase and to promote individuation in patients.” (Stein, 2006, p197) | JUNG PODCAST #28 - INDIVIDUATION 3In this episode I continue with Murray Stein\'s stage 2 (adapting/adjusting) of individuation, with an emphasis on some of the extremes of behaviour that occur in adolescence. I use ideas from Klein and Blos to expand on these behaviours. | JUNG PODCAST #27 IN INDIVIDUATION 2In this episode I continue with the material on individuation. I examine the early use by Jung of the term \'Individuation\', then work through some of the issues of Jung\'s conceptualization of the personality in terms of the first and second halves of life. The latter part of the episode begins with the first of three stages of individuation as conceptualized by Murray Stein - the containing/nurturing stage. | JUNG PODCAST #26 - INDIVIDUATION 1In this episode we begin working through Jung\'s central idea of Individuation. The first episode will focus on material from the Collected Works of Jung. I attempt to define individuation and give examples of some of the tricky issues that crop up whenever we deal with the topic. Issues such as Why individuate anyway? What are collective values? What has the encounter with the unconscious to do with this process of individuation? Why is individuation seen as a crime against the collective values? | JUNG PODCAST #25 - FEEDBACK3In this episode we deal with important questions regarding enantiodromia, dream interpretation and poetry (haiku) | JUNG PODCAST #3 - MODEL OF THE PSYCHE PART 2 - RE-RECORDED | JUNG PODCAST #24 - FEEDBACK2This episode continues with subscriber feedback and questions. Two very important questions regarding projection and the Shadow are dealt with. | JUNG PODCAST # 23 - FEEDBACKThis episode deals with listener feedback and questions.  | JUNG PODCAST #22 - ACTIVE IMAGINATION 2We continue to work through Jung\'s critical essay on the Transcendent function. I give specific guidance as to how one might enter into an active imagination.

In fact, the World Health Organization declared stress to be the health epidemic of the 21st century as eco anxiety or anxiety around the existing climate crisis and future survival of the human race. As that grows, I want to talk more about ways that we can all reduce a little stress in our day to day lives. So Sharon is here to share her tips related to sound healing based on a program that she originally developed for the integrated health institute at the Mount Royal University in Canada and his since presented to the Canadian Mental Health Commission, the Alberta Health region conference on chronic disease management, the Manitoba Health region, and the national health work and wellness conference in Quebec plus many others. | Today's guest is La Vee, a psychotherapist and host of The Thrift Therapy Podcast.

Much about this book can be learned from its subtitle: "Rediscovering Centuries Old Secrets to a Healthy, Long Life."\xa0The point being that much of what this book describes was known by our ancestors, and it\'s our job to unlearn what we\'ve come to know about aging, and relearn this crucial ancient wisdom. This fascinating book does a deep dive into the mechanisms that are involved in aging and then takes up some very interesting topics that are currently a part of our day-to-day discussions relating to aging, including the notion of fasting, the importance of understanding health implications of foods like like tea, red wine, and coffee, the controversial ideas of consuming dietary salt, why magnesium matters, what makes for a healthy versus unhealthy fat, and even explores Blue Zones, areas in the world in which there is extended lifespan. | Brain Body Diet\xa0is the newest book written by\xa0New York Times\xa0best-selling author,\xa0Dr. Sara\xa0Gottfried. Dr.\xa0Gottfried\xa0writes about the uniqueness of the female brain as it relates to physical body issues, such as weight loss, as well as psychological issues like anxiety, happiness, and mindfulness. It’s a deep dive into a vast array of lifestyle opportunities that can absolutely rewrite a woman’s health destiny.\xa0Brain Body Diet\xa0is an incredibly empowering work and I can assure you that you will find this interview to be very meaningful. I am honored that I have been given the opportunity to write the foreword for Dr. Gottfried‘s new book as well as permission to reprint it below. Take a read, and then enjoy today’s discussion. | Dr. Anna Cabeca has written a new book,\xa0The\xa0Hormone Fix,\xa0that focuses on the important role of diet and other lifestyle issues in terms of gaining hormone balance. She especially focuses on menopause and leveraging the fundamental relationship between a ketogenic diet and hormone function in what she calls the “keto-green way.” This is a unique feature of her new book that takes into account the importance of alkalinity for feeling well while engaged in a ketogenic program. Dr. Cabeca is a very special individual whom I deeply admire and respect. Please enjoy this interview, and be sure to let me know your thoughts below. | Today’s interview is with\xa0Lisa Mosconi, PhD. She is the associate director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic at Weil Cornell Medical College in New York. Prior to that she served as the director of the Nutrition and Brain Fitness Lab at New York University, School of Medicine. Dr. Mosconi holds a dual PhD degree in neuroscience as well as nuclear medicine from the University of Florence, Italy, and is board-certified in integrative nutrition. I think will really enjoy this interview and learn about her new book,\xa0Brain Food, which not only looks at nutrition but also leverages the science of nutritional genomics, and even the emerging science relating to the role of the microbiome in brain health. The book provides recommendations that we can all use with respect to the foods we eat and, interestingly, she does challenge some of our long-held notions. I hope you enjoy this discussion. |    While there certainly are various medications that prove somewhat helpful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson\'s disease, it\'s important to recognize that these medications are not actually treating the underlying disease itself. We now understand that one of the pivotal mechanisms in Parkinson\'s disease is compromise of energy production, at the level of the mitochondria. This ultimately manifest as various problems, not just in the brain, but actually throughout the entire body. With this understanding, specifically targeting mitochondrial function makes sense as a way of actually addressing this fundamental underlying abnormality in Parkinson\'s disease. \xa0 As many of you are aware, the ketogenic diet has been demonstrated to enhance mitochondrial function. As such, it should be considered as a candidate, at least, in terms of treating a disease like Parkinson\'s. In fact, this is the subject of a recent interventional trial in which actual Parkinson\'s patients were placed on a ketogenic diet under the direction of Dr. Matthew Phillips. \xa0 Today, the empowering neurologists interviews Dr. Matt Phillips about his recent published research in which he demonstrates powerfully positive results in Parkinson\'s patients placed on a ketogenic diet. How wonderful it is that we are now seeing published research dealing with nutritional interventions, especially in these challenging situations. \xa0    | When\xa0Grain Brain\xa0first hit shelves, one of the first questions I started to hear repeated to me again and again was “This is great and all, but what can I do if I’m a vegetarian?” The answer is simple: you can be a vegetarian and follow the Grain Brain lifestyle, no problem. Now as similar lifestyles begin to take the spotlight, the ketogenic lifestyle chief among them, the same question, posed about these diets, are coming to the fore. Thankfully, Dr. Will Cole is here to help. In his new book,\xa0Ketotarian, Dr. Cole lays out a lifestyle plan that expertly marries the vegetarian and ketogenic diets, bringing together the\xa0fat-burning power of ketogenic eating and the clean green benefits of a plant-centric plate. What could be better! | Without a doubt, we spend a lot of time in this forum discussing the influence of bacteria on the health of the gut, and how that translates into risk for disease elsewhere in the body. As it turns out, there are a multitude of other entities residing within the gut that are absolutely worthy of our attention. Bacteriophages\xa0are a type of virus that can infect bacteria and alter their function. First identified in 1917, bacteriophages have been long overlooked in terms of their potential contribution to human disease. Our interview today is with Dr. George Tetz, one of the world leaders in bacteriophage research. |   Last year I have the opportunity to interview professor Melissa Schilling on the topic of diabetes and Alzheimer\'s disease, in reference to her publication in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease.    I find it very fascinating that her research and publication are really quite unrelated, seemingly, to her profession as Professor of Management at New York University Stern School of Business. That said, as yet another manifestation that Prof. Schilling is truly a renaissance person, her new book,\xa0Quirky,\xa0explores the characteristics of some of the most incredible innovators who have changed the destiny of the world. What really distinguishes the people who literally change the world--those creative geniuses who give us one breakthrough after another? What differentiates Marie Curie or Elon Musk from the merely creative, the many one-hit wonders among us?  | This episode of\xa0The Empowering Neurologist\xa0looks at a new book from Dr. Rangan Chatterjee,\xa0How to Make Disease Disappear. Dr. Chatterjee is a medical doctor with nearly 20 years of hand-on, clinical experience seeing patients. He is double-board certified in both internal medicine and family medicine, and holds an honors degree in immunology. He is star of the BBC One TV show “Doctor in the House”, which has aired\xa0 in over 70 countries around the world. Dr. Chatterjee uses a functional and lifestyle medicine approach to reverse chronic disease. On the program, he actually moves in with families and helps them make important lifestyle changes targeted at improving health. | Recently, at the annual\xa0PaleoFX conference,\xa0I had the opportunity to sit on a panel alongside Dr. Michael Ruscio. I was extremely taken by his interaction with the audience, the compassion (and information) in his message, and the depth of his knowledge. I was delighted when he sent me his new book,\xa0Healthy Gut Healthy You,\xa0and I have found this book to be both extremely comprehensive and written in a user-friendly way. He has done an incredible job in writing this book and I’m hoping you will find it as interesting as have I once you’ve had a chance to read your copy. In the interview today, Dr. Ruscio explains how gut health relates to just about everything else in the body, how changes in gut health can manifest as disease, and what we can do to fix the problem\xa0— the ultimate goal.', 'chan_desc': 'The Empowering Neurologist is an interview series with some of the most exciting thought leaders in the field of health and wellness.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/56/52/68/565268ca-e30e-06dc-a3e1-a1325da951e9/mza_9177233228843399382.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2017-11-03'}}

This label left a long-lasting imprint on his self-worth, his identity, and beliefs in himself. Learning became his greatest mountain that he saw as an impossible climb. Having made it into university after years of struggle, Jim found himself at the same place he’d always been - incapable of scholarly success. Ready to succumb to the doubts within himself, Jim planned to quit school. It was in this time that Jim met someone who challenged the way he perceived his potential and changed his life forever. Firstly, he asked Jim to write down his aspirations on a piece of paper pulled from a journal that he had in his pocket. He then gave Jim the task to read one book per week about any great man or woman throughout history, plus personal development books - all while he was still completing his university. With the fear of failure taking over, Jim said, “I can’t do it”. This man immediately took the folded piece of paper from Jim’s hands and read his goals out loud. “Something about hearing your dreams come from a stranger’s voice… it shook my heart, it shook my spirit, my soul, something fierce” - those goals became the motivation he needed to push himself and to finally believe in himself. Today, Jim uses his experience of shattering those limiting beliefs to help others break through similar barriers and get their brains to reach their full potential. What belief do you have about yourself that are holding you back? Are you ready to break through that belief and make the impossible, possible? | Marie Forleo, NY Times best-selling author, life coach, and host of Marie TV, guides us through getting rid of those beliefs that could be holding you back.

As always, links to their website where you can get some will be in the shownotes -- and if you only try one type I recommend Lion\'s Mane, which is something I put in my morning coffee (approximately 1 gram) before blending it, for an incredible nootropic and focus effect on the brain. Definitely something for all of you who find it a struggle to keep your mind on single tasks.I hope you enjoy this mushroom-fuelled discussion with Skye Chilton of Real Mushrooms, and learn how to use fungi in your daily biohacking practice.\xa0REAL MUSHROOMS:\xa0https://realmushrooms.com/\xa0\xa0CONNECTConnect with Leon The Alchemist online for more intensive biohacking, longevity, and performance advice daily, with exclusive content you won\'t find anywhere else:INSTAGRAM: @LeonTheAlchemist |\xa0https://www.instagram.com/leonthealchemist\xa0TWITTER: @AlchemistLeon |\xa0https://twitter.com/alchemistleonLINKTREE:\xa0https://linktr.ee/leonthealchemistWEBSITE:\xa0http://bioalchemy.coCOURSE: http://bio.ax/\xa0LEARNWant to take your biohacking skills to the next level?

Today we\'re chatting about the topic of deuterium -- which is something that\'s in your body, in the food you\'re eating, the water you\'re drinking, and in fact, all around us in the environment. And what\'s scary as you\'ll learn in this podcast, deuterium is likely responsible for almost every disease you can imagine that\'s plaguing today\'s society.You\'ve probably never heard about deuterium, though as you\'ll learn in today\'s episode, it\'s likely the root cause of why you don\'t have enough energy, why you\'re aging faster than you should, and why you may be at a much higher risk of getting disease than ever before. And you\'ll also learn how to mitigate it, via the power of biohacking.In this episode, you\'ll be enlightened about what deuterium is exactly, the negative effects it can have on the human body, how excess deuterium causes your body to produce less energy through mitrochondrial disfunction, why it leads to early ageing, how to avoid excess deuterium in your food and water, the best ways to rid your body of deuterium, and much more.Dr Collins has also invited listeners of the Bio Alchemy podcast to take part in a deuterium study, which you can do via the link below.\xa0\xa0STUDY:\xa0https://www.ddcenters.com/bio-alchemy-study/DD CENTERS: https://ddcenters.com/\xa0CONSULT COUPON: "BIOALCHEMY" ($50 OFF)\xa0CONNECTConnect with Leon The Alchemist online for more intensive biohacking, longevity, and performance advice daily, with exclusive content you won\'t find anywhere else:INSTAGRAM: @LeonTheAlchemist |\xa0https://www.instagram.com/leonthealchemist\xa0TWITTER: @AlchemistLeon |\xa0https://twitter.com/alchemistleonLINKTREE:\xa0https://linktr.ee/leonthealchemistWEBSITE:\xa0http://bioalchemy.coCOURSE:\xa0http://bio.ax/\xa0\xa0LEARNWant to take your biohacking skills to the next level?

Thanks for all your patience and support.A legend in the world of superfoods, Darin Olien is known by the moniker "The Superfood Hunter" due to his extensive, phenomenal, and world-changing work in the world of superfoods, and powerful plant compounds. One of the interviews I\'ve been most excited about since starting my journey talking about biohacking on this podcast, Darin\'s interview is essential for anyone wanting to learn more about superfoods, and cut through the crap when it comes to what is and isn\'t legit in this extremely hyped up world of healing plants and nutrient-rich foods.The author of Superlife (https://amzn.to/2F2qA6c), Darin is no stranger to knowing all about what makes the human body tick, and how to effectively change your dietary environment to perform at a level you never thought possible. But it\'s not all about technological devices and space-age biohacks for Darin, he\'s all about taking things back to nature, and giving out bodies what they need to survive in a way that mimics our ancestral health.We talk about superfoods in detail in this episode, including some of the plants Darin has helped bring to the West, though you should pay special attention to when Darin talks about salt\xa0— specifically Himalayan pink mineral salt\xa0— and how you should be getting more of this into your system, and why it\'s so important.I highly recommend you learn more about Darin as he\'s an interesting character to say the least, and you can connect with him via the links below, and digest more of what he\'s all about.\xa0BARUKAS NUTS:\xa0https://barukas.com/SUPERLIFE BOOK:\xa0https://amzn.to/2Y1F2nx\xa0SUPERLIFE:\xa0http://superlife.com/\xa0DARIN ON INSTAGRAM:\xa0https://www.instagram.com/superlifeliving/\xa0CONNECTConnect with Leon The Alchemist online for more intensive biohacking, longevity, and performance advice daily, with exclusive content you won\'t find anywhere else:INSTAGRAM: @LeonTheAlchemist |\xa0https://www.instagram.com/leonthealchemist\xa0TWITTER: @AlchemistLeon |\xa0https://twitter.com/alchemistleonLINKTREE:\xa0https://linktr.ee/leonthealchemistWEBSITE:\xa0http://bioalchemy.coCOURSE:\xa0http://bio.ax/\xa0\xa0LEARNWant to take your biohacking skills to the next level?

Many of you won\'t have heard it as yet, so I hope it brings value.Essential oils are a controversial topic in some circles, due to the fact that they\'re sometimes peddled by stay-at-home MLM moms, who claim they can heal just about every condition on the planet, or be used as a remedy for absolutely everything. While many of the claims people like this looking to make a quick buck are incorrect, the simple fact is that essential oils can benefit us in many ways, and in some cases, their use is backed by real science.One such essential oil that I\'m going to speak about in this episode is lavender, which has clinical backing showing its effectiveness as an anti-anxiety tool, relaxant, and compound that can not only be used as a sleep aid, but even assist with insomnia, showing the potential power of this natural wellness compound.To those who are still doubters, and still may be unsure about the effectiveness of lavender oils, or essential oils in general as an effective biohacking tool, I recommend you don\'t take my word for it and consume some of the published data on the matter, including the studies I\'ve linked below. Though I don\'t blame you if you still have some reservations when some MLM mom is telling you on Facebook her oils can make you fly.If you\'re interested in learning more about essential oils, or want to secure some of your own lavender oil for use as a sleep aid, I always recommend Essential Oil Wizardry (https://bit.ly/2TeXLg7) as a trusted source I back due to their extremely high-quality products, and that the founder Dr. Nick Berry is simply an incredible dude who cares about the products he shares with the world.Some of the studies I mention in this podcast episode can be found below:\xa0STUDY — "Lavender and the nervous system":\xa0https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/STUDY\xa0— "An olfactory stimulus modifies nighttime sleep...":\xa0https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16298774STUDY\xa0— "Effect of inhaled lavender on sleep hygiene...":\xa0https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4505755/\xa0ESSENTIAL OIL WIZARDRY:\xa0https://bit.ly/2TeXLg7\xa0CONNECTConnect with Leon The Alchemist online for more intensive biohacking, longevity, and performance advice daily, with exclusive content you won\'t find anywhere else:INSTAGRAM: @LeonTheAlchemist |\xa0https://www.instagram.com/leonthealchemist\xa0TWITTER: @AlchemistLeon |\xa0https://twitter.com/alchemistleonLINKTREE:\xa0https://linktr.ee/leonthealchemistWEBSITE:\xa0http://bioalchemy.coCOURSE:\xa0http://bio.ax/\xa0\xa0LEARNWant to take your biohacking skills to the next level?

Almost completely a carnivore in his dietary observations, Bryan discusses how this lifestyle changed his gut health, fixed his joint pain, and changed his overall energy levels. As you all know, the carnivore diet is something I\'ve chatted about in previous episodes of the podcast and something I don\'t necessarily completely agree with, though Bryan will enlighten you on how it\'s personally aided him in many aspects of his life.In this episode, we discuss why natural light is so important for overall human health, how our ancestors used natural light and built their day around it, how over 1,000 genes are governed by light and vitamin d production, how red light therapy can be beneficial to health, what it can do for your mitochondria, Bryan\'s experiences on the carnivore diet, some of his daily biohacking practices, and much more.\xa0RED LIGHT RISING:\xa0https://redlightrising.co.uk/\xa0DISCOUNT CODE: BIOALCHEMY\xa0CONNECTConnect with Leon The Alchemist online for more intensive biohacking, longevity, and performance advice daily, with exclusive content you won\'t find anywhere else:INSTAGRAM: @LeonTheAlchemist |\xa0https://www.instagram.com/leonthealchemist\xa0TWITTER: @AlchemistLeon |\xa0https://twitter.com/alchemistleonLINKTREE:\xa0https://linktr.ee/leonthealchemistWEBSITE:\xa0http://bioalchemy.coCOURSE:\xa0http://bio.ax/\xa0\xa0LEARNWant to take your biohacking skills to the next level?

And in case you aren\'t aware, or haven\'t listened to previous episodes of the podcast, nootropics is just a fancy term for compounds that can help you perform better cognitively, that some people more commonly refer to as smart drugs. I don\'t care what you call them, they just help give your brain more thinking juice.Now despite the fact I do interview people on this podcast in relation to companies or products they\'re associated with, I always try my best to ensure episodes don\'t sound like infomercials. For me, the knowledge people like\xa0Roy\xa0have to offer to you\xa0— my listeners\xa0— is vastly more important than just someone pitching a product. However in this case, I did fanboy a little on the combination of a couple of products of Natural Stacks I\'ve used in the past in this episode, but I want you to all know that this is just my honest opinion. And again, not to sound like a dickhead in an infomercial, but I really do believe in what Natural Stacks does, as well as the effectiveness of the products they produce.In this episode, we discuss some of the shadier practices of some companies in the supplement industry, including how some supplement companies are literally putting peanuts in their products, how Natural Stacks tests all their products for quality, how smart drugs induce the novelty effect to help you focus, what Natural Stacks product combination I\'m totally fanboying on at the moment, how neurotransmitters control how you feel, upcoming research on brain performance, and much more.If you\'d also like to try any of Natural Stacks products, there is a discount link below to claim 20% off your first purchase.

Over the last ten years, James has taught thousands of people how to meditate more effectively around his home city of San Francisco, at conferences around the world, and to employees of some of the world\'s biggest companies including Salesforce, BitTorrent, and many others.\xa0A student of vedic master Maharishi Vyasananda, James studied this form of medidation for years before sharing it with the world, including an intensive practice in India, high in the Himalayan mountains. And if you\'ve ever been the kind of person to this that meditation is lumped into the "too hard" basket, or that it\'s always been a chore for you, chances are that James is the man who can turn that viewpoint around.In this episode, James enlightens us about what vedic meditation is and the how its process works, what a mantra is and how it applies to vedic meditation, how meditation can install the state of flow into your life, how most of us are human doings, when we should be human beings, some tactics that may help you stick to a meditation practice, why binaural beats can be an effective meditation for some, though why they\'re not the only answer, how to combine certain other practices with meditation, and so much more.You can learn more about James by checking out his websites below.\xa0VEDIC PATH MEDITATION: https://vedicpathmeditation.com/\xa0FLOW MEDITATION:\xa0https://www.flowmeditation.cc/\xa0\xa0CONNECTConnect with Leon The Alchemist online for more intensive biohacking, longevity, and performance advice daily, with exclusive content you won\'t find anywhere else:INSTAGRAM: @LeonTheAlchemist |\xa0https://www.instagram.com/leonthealchemist\xa0TWITTER: @AlchemistLeon |\xa0https://twitter.com/alchemistleonLINKTREE:\xa0https://linktr.ee/leonthealchemistWEBSITE:\xa0http://bioalchemy.coCOURSE:\xa0http://bio.ax/\xa0\xa0LEARNWant to take your biohacking skills to the next level?

Most notable known for founding the company Halo Neuroscience (https://www.haloneuro.com/), a company that produces the Halo Sport, a biohacking device that works by applying a small electric current to the area of he brain that controls movement–putting it into a state of hyperlearning.The neurostimulation that Halo employs leads the brain to become plastic, which makes it much easier for us to learn how to do new things. This state of neuroplasticity is something I spoke about in a previous episode in depth during my interview with Victor Mifsud the Blind Biohacker, and something Dr\xa0Chao\xa0will shed much more light on in this episode. But in short, this technology has some incredibly promising applications not just for human performance, but also for healing and rewiring the brain, as well as other parts of the body and nervous system.In this episode, we talk about what neuroplasticity is and how it can be beneficial for the brain, what the Halo device is and how it can supercharge learning, how your brain actually learns a new skill and why you should learn in the morning, how Halo helps you learn skills up to 50% faster, why it\'s being used by the military, surgeons, and pilots to improve work performance, how safe getting electrical stimulation of the brain using Halo us, how you can protect your brain from ageing and disease, and much more.If you like what you hear in this episode and want to get your own Halo to upgrade your learning abilities, Dr\xa0Chao\xa0has provided a discount code for listeners of this podcast to get the best price possible on the device.

For many people, gadgets and devices block consciousness and critical thought. How is the digital age contributing to more noise and confusion, instead of it being a way for us to achieve optimal health? What is the balance protocol and how can we use it to make better decisions in the face of so much information? On this episode, I’m joined by functional medicine physician and creator of the Balance Protocol, Dr. Anthony G. Beck. We discuss the perils of the digital age and how to separate the helpful information from the noise. \xa0 Takeaways + Tactics\xa0 People want to be entertained, so they get confused between information, knowledge and entertainment.\xa0  When people give us information, they should give you the inclusionary and exclusionary criteria, along with showing you how to measure and monitor it. Follow this formula: qualify, quantify, measure and monitor.\xa0  Scars are proof that we can heal, not that we’re vulnerable. They refine us and make us stronger.\xa0 \xa0 At the start of the show, Dr. Anthony discussed his journey, and how the digital age is bringing a lot of low integrity people to the forefront. Next, we talked about how to tell the difference between good information we can apply to our lives, and unhelpful noise. We also talked about how to avoid getting caught up in the Matrix.\xa0  We also discussed;  How to leverage tech without letting it rule us\xa0 Overcoming dark nights of the soul\xa0 The downsides of the digital age  \xa0 In a world where we are inundated and flooded with so much information, conflicting messages and even lies, we need to become filters in our own right. We need to develop the ability to figure out what applies to us, and recognize that the context of environment, lifestyle and mindset, matter as much as the information itself. Dr. Anthony’s insights remind us that no matter how much technology there is out there, our humanity, hearts and souls will always transcend the noise if we plug into that and not the devices and gadgets we own. \xa0 Guest Bio-\xa0  Dr. Anthony G. Beck is a functional medicine physician with over 25 years of experience. He is on a mission to educate, inspire and motivate patients to achieve their highest levels of wellbeing.

What is L.I.S.T and why is it a more powerful solution for ED? What are the biggest barriers that get in the way of men getting their ED treated? What is the Rocket and why is it a powerful solution for ED? On this episode, I’m joined by Dustin Wolff. He is a bio-hacking guru, Regenerative Medicine practitioner and co-founder of The Rocket, a revolutionary ED device. He shares on the work he does and how the Rocket will help thousands of men get their sex lives back on track. \xa0 Takeaways + Tactics\xa0 L.I.S.T employs a sonic wave that penetrates the soft tissue, which pushes blood flow to the area in order to repair it.  One of the major causes of ED is a build-up of plaque in the penis’ blood vessels. Shock wave therapy clears this plaque and renews these blood vessels.\xa0  The three reasons men don’t get treated for ED is affordability, accessibility and embarrassment. The Rocket is affordable, easily purchased online and allows you to treat yourself in the privacy of your home.  Being fit and in good health is the most powerful thing we can do to get better results with any treatment.\xa0  At the start of the show, Dustin shared his experiences of being in the military and how he got started in the ED field. Next, we talked about how the body can heal itself given the right environment and how Low Intensity Shockwave Therapy works. We also talked about why pills like Viagra don’t really treat ED and fix the underlying issue.\xa0  We also discussed;  How and why young men are struggling with ED\xa0 How the Rocket works and treats ED\xa0 Why treatment is more effective and successful in healthy people  \xa0 The Rocket doesn’t just temporarily bring blood flow to the penis, it actually solves the root problem, with absolutely no side effects. It will clear the blockage in the penis blood vessels and even promote the growth of new blood vessels. It’s safe, effective and affordable. The result is that men get firmer and longer lasting erections, which also impacts their marriages and self-confidence, helping them stand up taller and combat the challenges we’re facing. Learn more about The Rocket on this episode, and find out how you can use it to change your life. \xa0 Guest Bio-\xa0 Dustin Wolff is a regenerative medicine expert, bio-hacking guru and co-founder and president of the Novus Anti-Aging Center, which he runs with his wife, Stephanie.

Why is this negative stuff just as dangerous to our health as the biological issues? Why are the emotional effects of Erectile Dysfunction? What is the underlying root ideology of fear and how do we overcome it? On this episode, I talk to Michael Bertonatti, wellness specialist and clinical director of Miami’s number 1 optimization clinic, The Medical Health Institute. He shares on optimizing ourselves beyond the physical.\xa0 \xa0 Takeaways + Tactics\xa0 When we internalize our stress and low self-esteem issues, it starts to affect us biochemically.\xa0  If we give our bodies what they need, they would never break down. When we optimize our metabolic, neurological pathways, our bodies won’t be set up to get sick.\xa0  Identifying, connecting and surrendering to God can have a profound impact on us, how we feel about ourselves and navigating this world.\xa0   At the start of the show, Michael shared his story and how his own health issues led him down the path of helping people. Next, we talked about how widespread the testosterone deficiency epidemic is, and why the media sensationalizes and demonizes the use of therapeutic hormonal optimization. We discussed why that has a lot to do with money and trying to instill fear in us. We talked about relentless education and how technology, social media and other distractions have made people lazy.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 We also discussed;  How ED affects self-esteem\xa0 The one common denominator in people who value their health\xa0 Vulnerability, masculinity and the importance of having someone to talk to Tools to improve spirituality  \xa0 The truth about the world we live in today is that we have to use multiple vehicles in order to achieve optimum health. Testosterone and hormone optimization is not the only tool that can address our problems because we also need to deal with our emotional and mental health and make sure we are educated, informed and enlightened in everything we do. Optimization isn’t just a hormone or biochemical change, it’s a lifestyle overhaul which will shatter the whole sick care model as we know it.\xa0 \xa0 Guest Bio-\xa0 Michael is a wellness & BHRT specialist and the clinical director at The Medical Health Institute. He has been in practice for ten years helping patients attain optimal health without using conventional medicine.

How is this approach causing more harm than good? Why is the chiropractic so important to our overall health and wellness? What are the pillars of mental toughness? On this episode, I talk to insightful chiropractor, coach and restaurateur, Dr. Ralph Napolitano, who shares on pain, dysfunction, what’s wrong with the system, and how we can avoid getting overcome by it. \xa0 Takeaways + Tactics\xa0 Once your skeletal system has a dysfunction, your health will start to deteriorate and degenerate, which leads to other problems including digestive issues.\xa0  The digestive system makes up half of our nervous system, and if we don’t eat well it will affect many aspects of our health.\xa0  Mental toughness is all about mindset mastery, accurate thought, confidence and magnetic influence.\xa0 \xa0 At the start of the show, Dr. Ralph shares how he got to where he is today, and why so many people in the gym are missing the point entirely. Next, we talked about the difference between pain and dysfunction, and what skeletal and nervous misalignment can do to the rest of the body. Towards the end, we talked about the lessons Dr. Ralph learned from his late father.\xa0  We also discussed;\xa0  The pillars of mental toughness\xa0 The importance of the gut in the rest of the body\xa0 Why the news media is so dangerous  \xa0 Everyone in our world is constantly keying in on the pain, challenges, and issues, and throwing quick fixes like medication at the problem. The problem is, this just doesn’t solve anything, and in the case of the skeletal and nervous system, it leads to even bigger problems downstream. If we focus on solving the dysfunction, we’ll create long-lasting solutions and true optimization. \xa0 Guest Bio-\xa0 Dr. Ralph is a licensed chiropractor, coach and restaurateur in New York City.

How was C60 developed, and what is the science behind why it works? How does C60 optimize and improve our health? On this episode, C60 Purple Power CEO, Ken Swartz, shares on why C60 is the miracle super-oxidant we need to be optimized.\xa0\xa0   Takeaways + Tactics\xa0 C60 is a carbon molecule made up of 60 carbon atoms. When testing the new molecule, scientists discovered that it doubled the lifespan of animals.\xa0 In humans, C60 increases visual acuity and fat loss, improves libido, athletic performance and endurance. It’s even been known to make stem cells younger.\xa0 Take C60 in the morning because it’s a stimulant.\xa0 \xa0 At the start of the episode, Ken shared on how he got started with C60 and the story of its development, and the testing methods and tools that were used. We also talked about why it’s only now being used in humans. We also talked about how the molecule supercharges the mitochondria, and what that does for our health.\xa0 \xa0 We also talked about;  Why C60 is used as a delivery method for medications How CC60 makes us younger\xa0 How C60 improves athletic function\xa0  C60 is revolutionizing age management because of it’s incredible abilities to not only increase life span, but to improve health and so many functions in the body. These include libido, energy, focus and concentration, athletic performance, endurance and fat loss. The molecule supercharges the mitochondria, de-ages stem cells and helps the body in so many ways. If you’re looking to be optimized, it’s worth adding C60 to your supplement regimen. It is the most powerful and versatile molecule there is.\xa0 \xa0 Guest Bio-\xa0 Ken Swartz, is the CEO of C60 Purple Power and host of the C60 show.

What is the connection between our highly toxic environments and the condition? Why does treatment have to go beyond just killing the parasites? What are the other factors leading to the rise of Lyme Disease in our population? Why are our internal drainage pathways so vital in treating the disease? On this episode, I’m joined by prominent functional medicine physician, clinician, bestselling author and speaker, Dr. Jay Davidson. He shares on his mission to help cure Lyme disease, and what we can do to eliminate pathogens and detox our bodies. \xa0 Takeaways + Tactics\xa0 Emotional trauma is as much a health risk factor as our environment, the food we eat and how well we take care of our bodies.\xa0 When it comes to treating disease, we shouldn’t just focus on the diagnosis, or how our DNA caused it. There’s always an environmental or habit-based source of the illness.\xa0 Drainage is extremely important in letting out the toxins. The most important drainage pathways in our bodies are the colon, the liver bile duct and lymphatic pathway.\xa0 If your brain is firing on all cylinders, you should be able to download information and retain it easily. If you’re having issues with memory, and cognitive function, it might be due to a lymphatic drainage issue. \xa0 At the start of the show, Dr. Jay Davidson shared on how he got into medicine, and how his wife’s struggles with Lyme disease led him down the path he’s now on to help people suffering from the condition. Next, we talked about how unresolved emotional trauma affects our physical health. “Typically, the more symptoms someone has, and the more they are struggling to get better, the more past trauma they have.” We also talked about why we need to shift our focus to unlocking our DNA instead of just thinking about the issues it might be causing.\xa0 We also discussed\xa0  How our life experiences are a projection of our inner state The difference between drainage and detoxing\xa0\xa0 The best foods and treatments to keep our bowels functional\xa0  \xa0 Our bodies are constantly assaulted by toxicity, mould, parasites, emotional trauma, and bad food choices. For us to survive, there are no other options besides detoxification, optimization and any other measure we can use to stay healthy. Lyme disease is a reflection of the times we’re living in, but that doesn’t mean that we are powerless against it. By eliminating toxins, keeping our drainage pathways clear and eating the right foods and taking the right supplements, our health can be restored.\xa0 \xa0  Guest Bio-\xa0To Download Your FREE PDF Copy of the Amazon Best Seller: The Definitive Testosterone Replacement Therapy MANual, Click Here\xa0 For a FREE Paperback Copy.

What are the key supplements an optimization-minded man should be taking? How can erectile dysfunction get addressed? How can men get rid of fat? On this episode, Dr. Jeffrey Ruterbusch shares on optimization tips and hacks, and his experience doing medicine all over the world. \xa0 Takeaways + Tactics\xa0 When it comes to natural testosterone boosters, none of them show anything beyond transient elevation. If we train first thing in the morning on an empty stomach when our glucagon levels are the highest, and take hydroxycitric acid and l-carnitine, we’ll get chiseled\xa0 Tesofensine is phenomenal for weight loss.\xa0 \xa0 At the start of the show, Dr. Jeffrey shared how he got started, and how optimization supplements have changed over the decades. Next, we talked about whether natural testosterone boosters work, and why you should train when your glucagon levels are high.

The only challenge is, there are a lot of fraudsters claiming to sell the real thing when they aren’t. Why is this such a problem in the world of supplements? How can we identify reputable sources and sellers so we don’t waste our money? What are the benefits of C60? On this episode, SES Research co-founder and C60 expert, Chris Burres shares why C60 is a key optimization supplement and where to buy it.\xa0  Four Takeaways\xa0 Genuine C60 should dissolve and turn purple when you put it in into sunflower seed oil.\xa0 Most scientific studies are done with the intention to come to a specific conclusion, which is the opposite of science.\xa0 Because people aren’t protecting themselves from blue screens and devices, we don’t get into restorative, deep, polyphasic sleep, which is where we release growth hormone.\xa0 If you’re looking for legitimate sellers of C60, don’t buyer from a company that only sells on Amazon, and has no website or physical address. When you’re dealing with a legitimate company, you can call them and have an intelligent conversation.\xa0    At the start of the show, Chris shared how he got started, and how to find reputable C60 sellers. We talked about red flags that tell you a seller is selling fake supplements. We also discussed why so many studies shouldn’t be trusted.\xa0  We also discussed:  Why the supplement industry is so prone to fakes How C60 improves sleep\xa0   What makes C60 special is that there’s nothing quite like it. There’s no other supplement that gives you energy throughout the day and helps you sleep better at night. But in this “buyer beware” era it can be hard knowing that you’re actually buying the real thing. It’s so important to do you homework and buy from companies that have validity. If you buy the real thing, and you incorporate it into your life, you will be in the best health of your life.\xa0\xa0  Guest Bio-\xa0 Chris is an entrepreneur, Co-Owner of SES Research Inc and Owner and Operator of eWebResults.com. https://www.sesres.com/.

How do peptides work and why are they crucial to healing and cell regeneration? How can we reconcile what we know now about cell biology and how we attack disease and aging? What are the best peptides to use and how can we optimize our peptide use? On this episode, I’m honored to be joined by orthopedic surgeon, leading sports medicine physician, and game-changing performance optimizing master-mind, Dr. William Seeds. He shares powerful insights on the peptide revolution and how they are changing the face of medicine. \xa0 Four Takeaways\xa0 Aging is the #1 risk factor in health. When a cell deteriorates and fails to start the process of autophagy, it goes into senescence. Peptides can interrupt this process.\xa0 The immune system is paramount. Many health process breakdowns are caused by a problem in the immune system.\xa0 From age 30, there’s a slow down in the production of growth hormone and IGF.\xa0 Exposing the brain and the body to constant stimulation of growth hormone can do more harm than good to a patient.\xa0 \xa0 At the start of the show, Dr. Seeds shares on the use of peptides in professional sport, and how peptides actually work. Next, we talked about how long it will take for medical system to actually benefit people. Dr. Seeds also shared on his favorite peptides, how he uses them and the health issues they solve.\xa0 \xa0 We also discussed;\xa0  The best peptides for improved brain function\xa0 Melanotan and conscious expansion Why Dr. Seeds combines GHRHs with GHRPs\xa0  \xa0 Thanks to the advancement of optimization medicine, we finally have the biotechnology to extend our lives and use biotechnology to reverse or control the effects of aging. Through peptides, we give the body the ability to do what it did well when we were younger, and give it that chance to do it well as we age. Peptides aren’t about cheating the health code or enhancing performance, they are about repairing and restoring our bodies. Every aspect of our bodies and our health can be completely changed by peptides.\xa0  Guest Bio-\xa0 Dr. Seeds is a board-certified orthopedic surgeon and physician specializing in all aspects of sports medicine and total joint treatments. With over 22 years of experience, Dr. Seeds is focused on providing the most innovative results to those seeking to maximize their performance, relieve injuries, and live a healthy lifestyle.

From fitness coach, to blogger, to photographer to downright awesome human, it\'s safe to say that Minna wears many hats so it was fun to have her on the show to share more about her journey and how she defines wellness.

What about pairing CBD with herbal medicine? Where are you sourcing your CBD from? These are all important questions that we have yet to tackle here on the podcast. So today I invited Prismatic Plants founder, Sarah Polansky onto the show to share all of her CBD and herbalism wisdom with us today.

This week\'s episode is jam-packed! Brain health is something I\'m deeply passionate about both because of my past work in brain imaging research but also from my own struggles with mental health.

It\'s not a secret that I am deeply passionate about women\'s health, but what I\'ve found in my many conversations on this topic is that women are rarely informed about what\'s happening in their body before they run into an issue. It\'s very much reactive medicine rather than preventative. Besides getting a pap smear, it is incredibly difficult for women to start a conversation about their reproductive health unless they\'re already dealing with an issue. This is why Modern Fertility was born. Today on the podcast I am chatting with Afton Vechery, one of the cofounders of Modern Fertility all about women\'s preventative health including getting your hormones tested, preparing for fertility (even if you don\'t want kids right now) and making the tools for these accessible to ALL.\xa0 On today\'s episode we also discuss:  Her own hormone struggles and why she decided to start Modern Fertility The factors that affect female fertility and getting your hormones tested PCOS vs. POI and why it\'s important to know the difference The most common issues with fertility Freezing your eggs - should you do it?

We had to choose our health, our families, our marriages, and the other things that really matter above pushing this book out there, and that's okay.” (18:55) “It's so worth it for you to feel like ‘I can just listen to myself and honor what works for me’, and not get so caught up in what's working for someone else, or again what may be very well based in good science, it just doesn't land well for you with your goals, your hormone imbalances and your particular set of stuff right now.” (26:15) “I think as women we often want to go back to ‘well that worked really well for me last time’.

Carrie Jenkins is a writer and philosophy professor who explores the philosophy behind love and the impact of socially constructed romantic love.\xa0 Love is a subjective experience, and it is only by combining the theories of love as biology, phenomenology, chemistry, and magic that we can begin to piece together the puzzle of this conscious experience. Instead of thinking of love as a winning or losing game, or something that you are failing at, Carrie argues that love is a deliberate act that anyone can be a part of. Instead of putting the fairytale of romantic love on a pedestal, Carrie works to open up the guidelines in which we treat love in all realms of our lives. By putting the same status on other relationships in our lives, not just that of romance, you can separate the connection between romance and attachment to find the version of love that best suits you right now.\xa0 Combining science and philosophy to find the answers to the questions not fully understandable to us yet, Carrie is shining a light on the power of love and why you should stop romanticizing romance. How has the social construct around love and romance impacted your relationship with yourself and others?

Someone living through the things. The real trick is not to try to choose between those, but to see how they could both be true at the same time. Then well really understand it.” (10:41) “The problem with the romantic bit of romantic love is that we put that one kind of great life on a pedestal. And we said ‘that's the really good life, and everything else is at best a kind of approximation, and if you don't measure up to the idea, maybe you did your best or you kind of failed’.” (16:47) “At some point, we have to start asking the question, am I really doing something wrong? Or is the message wrong or just not right for me?” (19:43) “Reality never looks like the fairy story, never has and never will, and yet we all hold ourselves to that as an ideal.” (25:02) “There are so many ways that the story can go, it's not fair on us that we only tell ourselves the one story, there are so many good stories.” (35:03) \xa0 Links Carrie Jenkins Website Follow Carrie on Twitter What Love Is and What It Could Be by Carrie Jenkins \xa0 Find the full show notes for this episode here Keep up with all things Love Is Medicine Follow Razi on Facebook\xa0|Instagram | Sleep issues are common, they are everywhere, and almost every single person will face sleep challenges at some point in their life.

Unfortunately what has happened is the number of hours of sleep people are getting per night has been steadily declining by about 20% of the last century.” (4:33) “A lot of people I think view working hard and playing hard and not getting a full night's sleep as sort of a badge of honor. I actually take the opposite view. It is not actually work ethic when it starts to interfere with our health, when it starts to cause not only physical disease but emotional stress and psychological problems, the list goes on and on.” (5:13) “You are ultimately who is in charge, you are the boss, we work for you. You need to make sure that you are getting the service that is important to you, you are getting the information that is important to you, you're getting what you need.” (19:17) “I think dreaming gives us an opportunity to reflect and if we are having uneasy dreams, if we are having dreams that are disconcerting, that is our mind and our body struggling withs something, something is not right.” (31:42) “If I were only to focus on [biochemistry] I would really be doing a disservice to my mentors, to my training, to the memory of naturopathic physicians who came before me who were integral in having this profession and keeping this medicine alive.” (42:55) \xa0 Links NBI Health Website TAP Integrative Website \xa0 Find the full show notes for this episode here Keep up with all things Love Is Medicine Follow Razi on Facebook\xa0|Instagram | After seven years of suffering from chronic nerve pain that left her bedridden, Dr. Brandy Gillmore decided to stop listening to the doctors saying ‘there was nothing that could be done’ and take her healing measures into her own hands. Fascinated by the power of placebo, and eventually finding true physical healing through mental stimulation, Dr. Gillmore has been on the path to sharing this knowledge with others ever since.

And so that’s what opened my entire journey of self-healing and healing with the mind.” (7:07) “It didn’t make sense to me that logically we could see that emotions could impact us to the point of death, and it was nowhere in our health system. And not only that, but that 8 emotions could impact the physical body and the rest of them didn’t do anything. That didn’t make sense either so that’s the path I started going down.” (15:29) “I started taking people who were in chronic pain, and showing them how to release the chronic pain in minutes using just their mind, so they could actually see the results.” (22:09) “When we let go of hurt, of negativity, of all this stuff, not only do we feel better and happier, but the way it attracts\xa0 changes in our life is truly incredible.” (32:52) “A plant needs food, where you give it fertilizer, it needs water, and it needs the sun, which is energy.

Skipped a big event or a day at the beach because you don’t look the way you think you should? Why? What do you think will be different when you reach your weight goal? When I ask my clients these questions, they say things like:  \xa0I’ll be happier. \xa0I’ll be able to go to the beach. \xa0I’ll be able to buy clothes I love.\xa0\xa0 I’ll have more self-confidence.\xa0\xa0  Really? I wonder. I ask them questions like:  Why can’t you be happier now? Why can’t you go to the beach now?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Why can’t you buy clothes you love now?\xa0\xa0 Why can’t you have more self-confidence now?  There really is no reason why you can’t have all of those things now, regardless of your current weight.\xa0 Putting off living until you lose the weight is actually approaching it backwards. Listen to learn how you can change your mindset and live your best life NOW to make losing weight easier. | Are you spending so much time working in your job that it interferes with your ability to take proper care of yourself? Do you mindlessly gobble down lunch at your desk? Does regular exercise fall to the bottom of your “to do” list because it can’t compete with your overbooked work schedule?\xa0 I get it. I’ve practiced law, a profession famous for overworking. In my four years in a high pressure firm, I became a compulsive overeater to deal with the stress, and I gained 40 pounds!\xa0 You can definitely work too much, and it can have consequences for your health, including causing you to gain more weight. Listen to learn how your employment may be contributing to weight gain and what you can do about it. | Do you feel stressed out often? Although we hear a lot about stress in the media, many people overlook the effect that it has, not only on their overall health, but on their weight, too.\xa0\xa0 Stress management is as important a part of becoming healthy and dropping those extra pounds as changing your eating habits is. Maybe you’re thinking, whaaaat? How does sitting around meditating and not burning calories help me lose weight?\xa0\xa0 Different stressful life experiences have different effects on us. Sometimes, stress can cause people to lose their appetite. Other times, it can trigger the urge to eat to soothe yourself and avoid those uncomfortable emotions. Listen to learn why stress makes it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it, and what you can do to reduce the effects of stress in your life. And grab a copy of the Stress Reduction Resources Think Sheet, too! | It is more important to listen to your body and allow it’s messages to take the lead when it comes to when, what and how much you eat than it is to be at your goal weight.\xa0\xa0 Does that surprise you?\xa0 In our society, there isn’t much emphasis placed on listening to our bodies. The emphasis is on immediate gratification. That’s why obesity is at epidemic proportions. One of the reasons why I believe in the primacy of listening to your body is that being at your goal weight doesn’t necessarily make you happy.\xa0 But when you inhabit your body and use its messages for guidance, you achieve happiness and balance in your life.\xa0 Isn’t that the point? If your body isn’t happy, you won’t be either.\xa0 Listen to learn about your relationship with your body and why it should be your closest advisor regarding what it needs and what you need.\xa0\xa0 If you want to learn how to listen to your body and eat consciously, grab my free 30 days of Conscious Eating Calendar at the link on my website. | Have you been assuming that the reason you can’t lose weight is because being overweight runs in your family?\xa0 Is almost everyone in your family overweight?\xa0 Do you believe that genetics are causing your weight problem? Research on families and obesity has shown that children of overweight parents have a whopping 80 percent chance of being overweight themselves, but that genetics plays a very small part in that determination.\xa0\xa0 What seems to matter most is your family environment. So while you probably can’t blame your parents for giving you “bad genes,” they may have taught you bad eating habits. Or created an unfavorable eating culture.\xa0 Family dynamics and home environment have a much larger effect on weight than genetics. MUCH larger. That doesn’t mean that you didn’t inherit genes that put you at a higher risk for obesity. Maybe you did, but it also doesn’t mean that being an unhealthy weight is your destiny. You aren’t destined to have your mother’s body! You can overcome any genetic predisposition by changing your habits. Listen to this week's episode to learn more.\xa0 If you want to learn what you need to do to become a healthy weight in a sensible sustainable way, grab a copy of my 8 Secrets for Permanent Weight Loss at the link on my website. | You’re a foodie, and you really love food, right?\xa0\xa0 But do you rush through your meals, or give yourself time to enjoy them? One of the simplest steps you can take to improve your health and well being, and shed some extra weight is to slow down. Yes, eating slowly improves your health.\xa0 Eating fast is a habit. Like any habit, you can change it. Listen to learn the reasons why you should choose to become a slow eater, and how to become one! For more tips on how to live and eat the naturally slim way, grab my free 8 Secrets for Permanent Weight Loss at the link under Free Resources on my website. | Is it hard for you to avoid overeating at parties? On vacations? Or other special events? Are those the kinds of things that throw you off track, then you have trouble getting back on your weight loss path? I have a very simple strategy for you to use so you can navigate any eating situation without overeating.\xa0 Planning ahead and visualization. There are a few different approaches to planning ahead, and not all of them are suitable for foodies. Some are overly rigid, and require you to ignore your body’s messages. My approach doesn’t do that. Listen below to learn how you can use planning ahead and visualization to have a peaceful relationship with food and eating while also navigating previously challenging situations with grace and finesse!\xa0 For more strategies for eating what you love while shedding your extra weight, head over to my website, ShariBroder.com, and grab your copy of 8 Secrets for Permanent Weight Loss. | If you want to be healthy, then eating healthy is important. That’s not rocket science.\xa0 And who doesn’t want to be healthy?\xa0 But can you go overboard? Can healthy eating or so-called “clean eating” become an obsession that is actually unhealthy? The answer is yes. You CAN take healthy eating to an extreme.\xa0 There’s even a name for it: Orthorexia. What is orthorexia and why is it important to recognize the symptoms? Listen to learn more about this unhealthy obsession with eating “clean” and healthy food, and how, rather than making someone healthier, it can actually have the opposite effect. Head over to my website, sharibroder.com, for lots of free resources (it’s one of the menus in the header and there’s a link in the show notes), including 8 Secrets for Permanent Weight Loss, a 30 Days of Conscious Eating Calendar, Podcast Think Sheets, and more! | Do you hate the way you look?\xa0 Do you wonder how you could ever feel okay about your body?\xa0 If you’re middle-aged or older, do you worry about your wrinkles and the effect gravity is having on your body? In my opinion, women spend way too much of their time and energy focusing on that one small aspect of ourselves: our appearance. Almost all of us are guilty. There is so much more to you than the way you look!\xa0 Yes, I coach people about how to permanently lose weight, but I believe that having a healthy relationship with food and eating and being healthy are so much more important than the size of your body or what you look like.\xa0 But sadly, throughout history, women’s appearance has been given way too much weight in determining our value.\xa0 Despite the feminist movement, the situation is getting worse. According to Dr. Nancy Etcoff at Harvard Medical School, the latest research shows that low body image in women is a global issue of epidemic proportions.\xa0 When we spend so much of our time and energy worrying about our appearance, we can’t spend it doing something really meaningful, productive, or that make a difference in your life and the lives of others.\xa0 LISTEN to learn more about what it means to have a good body image, and why you don’t need to look like Jessica Alba to have one! | What’s the very best way to lose weight?\xa0 There are tons of diets out there, each one clamoring for your attention and maybe your money.\xa0 But do any of them work?\xa0 When I say “work,” I mean they do more than just produce temporary weight loss. Lots of diets, if someone stays on them long enough, will produce temporary weight loss. So when I say “work,”\xa0 I mean that if you follow the program, you can not only lose weight, but actually keep it off without wasting a ton of your precious energy and mental real estate fretting about food and eating. That means it must teach you how to eat in a sustainable way, and help you heal your relationship with food and eating.\xa0 Listen to learn what characteristics are necessary in a weight loss program for it to be sustainable so that you drop the extra weight and don't gain it back.

The simple power of poop has been found to be 92 percent effective in treating the opportunistic and antibiotic resistant bacteria C. difficile, with patients reporting dramatic recoveries within 12 hours. Though these “ick factor” therapies remain experimental, having not yet received full FDA backing, hundreds of trials are underway across the country to determine their future in treating IBD, SIBO autism, obesity and other inflammatory conditions. And plenty more people have taken matters into their own hands to try their luck with fecal transplants at home. Today on the podcast, we talk about all things stool transplants: how they work, who might benefit most, and what we still don’t understand about their efficacy within the whole microbial ecosystem in all its complexity. Joining me is Dr. Andrea McBeth of Flora Medicine, who is one of the leading experts in the field. Make sure to listen to the end of the episode as she also addresses the recent controversy over the FDA halting several trials using fecal transplants and what the future might hold for Big Pharma and every day sufferers. A quick taste of what we’ll cover:  How FMT works and the best mechanisms for delivery for various gut issues Why all the other matter in your poop is equally if not more important than the bacteria when recolonizing your microbiome SIBO, IBD, autism, obesity and other inflammatory conditions that are being explored right now with FMT treatment Methods for doing a DIY fecal transplant or fecal therapy How to choose and properly screen a donor The difference between a therapeutic dose for shifting an ecosystem and what you might need to eradicate a pathogen Risk factors and why we still need more safety precautions Why FMT could help certain SIBO cases What lifestyle and diet strategies you need in order for the FMT to work long-term And so much more...

And yet, it’s often when we take our biggest missteps. In today’s episode, we go beyond SIBO to talk about the rules of greater gut health, why our detachment from the earth is making sick, and how by simply getting dirtier we can correct some of the microbiome mistakes from our youth. I’m joined by Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a pediatric neurologist, herbalist, urban farmer, and bestselling author of The Dirt Cure: Healthy Food, Healthy Gut, Happy Child. In our chat, we discuss what’s happening in a developing gut and how some of the popular ills of childhood – like ear infections, fever, rashes, colic, hyperactivity – relate to food sensitivities and a damaged microbiome. More importantly, Dr. Maya gives us some concrete advice on natural alternatives to conventional over-the-counter drugs that might be damaging your kid’s microbiome further. If you’re someone who is still putting together all the pieces of your health puzzle (or a child’s) this conversation will bring a lot of aha moments, and offer plenty of suggestions for moving forward.\xa0 A quick taste of what we’ll cover:  How the genetic vulnerabilities we’re born with play out via our lifestyle and environmental triggers What being out in nature does for our nervous system and biodiversity How the microbiome interacts with the microvirome – our body’s ecosystem of viruses Why childhood fevers are so important for immune development How gut health impacts the nervous system and why certain children present with neurological issues like ADHD or Autism, and others will get an ear infection Why early childhood emotional or physical trauma can affect gut health later in life Cranial-Sacral Therapy, reiki, chiropractic adjustments and how you can expand your child’s wellness toolkit How to approach an elimination diet for children Natural tools for your medicine cabinet to fight common childhood ailments like fever, rashes, etc. What dietary culprits could be behind chronic ear infections in children How we can apply the rules of greater gut health in adult life, even after imperfect childhoods  Resources, mentions and notes:  Where you can find Dr. Maya Shetreat Maya’s bestselling book, The Dirt Cure Episode 13 with Aviva Romm: advice on how to rebound from a C section Episode 7 with Jason Wysockion bodywork and SIBO Fever breaking kit: peppermint oilcompresses + yarrowor elderflower for sweat Join the\xa0SIBO Made Simple Facebook Community Page Subscribe to receive a\xa0free download of the episode transcript  This episode is brought to you by\xa0Epicured, a low FODMAP meal delivery service that understands that food is medicine.

Today’s episode discusses some of the controversy around the effectiveness of breath testing, when it’s worth doing, how to make sure your results are accurate, and what other tests might be better at getting to the bottom of your gut issues. Joining me is Dr. Patrick Fratellone, a functional cardiologist and herbalist who used to practice with the late Dr. Robert C. Atkins. He takes us through how he does his gut detective work as a functional medicine doctor, including what comprehensive tests on genetics, vitamin levels and intestinal permeability can tell you about your bigger gut picture. If you’re someone who’s been debating whether or not to get a breath test for SIBO, this episode might help you weigh that decision. A quick taste of what we’ll cover:  Whether doing a SIBO breath test is worth your time, money and energy What other tests are necessary to determine how your small intestine is functioning Why vitamin D levels are great indicators of your gut health How Dr. Fratellone goes through his process of elimination (hint: SIBO is not the first condition to rule out) MTHFR genes and what they tell you about your health picture, including SIBO Genetic origins of IBS and how to test for them Candida versus SIBO: how to tell the difference Testing for leaky gut / intestinal permeability and why it’s important How to prepare properly for a SIBO breath test so your results are accurate IGG reactivity testing and what it actually tells you  Resources, mentions and notes:  Where to find Dr. Patrick Fratellone  Genova Diagnostics Digestive Stool Analysis\xa0  Thorne Onegevity Stool Test 3-Hour Lactulose Breath Test for SIBO  Intestinal permeability test for leaky gut\xa0 Leaky gut treatment: liquid vitamin D + powdered L-glutamine Viome microbiome kits IgG reactivity testing  Become a recipe tester for the SIBO Made Simple BOOK!!

Think butterflies in your stomach before a big presentation, that last minute urge to pee before going on stage. And if you’re someone with SIBO or other digestive issues, you might be dealing with some of the other downwind symptoms that occur when we let our anxiety get out of control. On today’s episode, I’m joined by Dr. Megan Riehl, a GI psychologist (yes, it’s a thing) who specializes in tactical approaches to relieving visceral hypersensitivity, food fears, and anxiety related to our gut.

She\'s a mum of 2, with a third baby on the way, she\'s a prenatal &\xa0paediatric chiropractor and business owner.\xa0 In this episode we discuss the importance of self care throughout pregnancy and into motherhood. Stephanie & myself also veer off into the extremely important discussion of expectations. The people around you (and their views on pregnancy/birth) can make or break your outcomes, so choose them wisely! |   Feng Shui Mommy – the book – was sent to me by Bailey’s PR team as a fit for the show. I’ll be honest, when I first looked into it, my thoughts were: “WTF!? Feng Shui is some Chinese home organisation thing, right?” How does Feng Shui Mommy even fit into a book title?! I took a look around Bailey’s website so I could get a feel for her before having her on the show. I’m happy for a good dose of hippy but I’m not an all-out-woo kinda girl. I just couldn’t see how the concepts of house & pregnancy could possibly be linked. Herein lies the genius. FENG SHUI PRINCIPLES Bailey Gaddis is a doula, a hypnobirthing coach and, in a past life, was also a home organiser. But Feng Shui Mommy isn’t about organising your house. It’s about organising your energy. That’s what Bailey does so well in this book, and it’s the reason I wanted to chat to her on the show. She’s all about the energy. Where feng shui in the home focuses more on your outer world, she relates these principles to your inner world. Pregnancy is such a gorgeous time to connect with your baby, but a lot of us really don’t have the balance in mind, body & spirit. Feng shui mommy is about creating your own perspective of birth rather than listening to the fear-based culture that exists. CREATING YOUR BIRTH COMMUNITY If you were able to create a group of people who were supportive of you and your dreams, how much better would that be? Imagine surrounding yourself with people who think like you, who make you feel good, and who can transform the ‘normal’ version of birth. That’s one of the things we talked about, plus a lot more too. We chatted about the 4th trimester, which is something a lot of people don’t seem to think even exists(!) We spoke about the energetic blockages to birth (mothers of pregnant mums, we’re looking your way). And most importantly, we had a good natter about how to clear the negative energy around you.

( And you should – it’s great! )    \xa0 | This episode is a MUST LISTEN for anyone in the UK. The face of birth is changing - midwives are currently regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (an oxymoron in itself!), who are proving themselves to be unfit for purpose.\xa0 Rather than being responsible\xa0for assisting the wants of the women they are providing care for - which has always been the duty of a midwife - under the new regulations, midwives are instead going to have their practice ruled by what their employer (the NHS trust or the private company who they work for) wants them to do. Why does this matter? Well, if you want to give birth outside of the "norm" for that employer then you may be told you\'re not allowed.\xa0 For years, I\'ve seen memes that pronounce "You\'re not allowed to tell me I\'m not allowed" and "My body, my baby, my birth".\xa0 Under the current changes, this has the potential to all change. Listen to Katherine explain the situation much better than I can! It really is an eye opening episode. | Feeling like a failure after my caesarean This is an off-the-cuff episode that I recorded whilst sitting in a hotel room early in the morning. The weekend away was a planned bit of relaxation for myself and my beautiful friend MaryAnne (from the You\'re Doing Great Mom podcast). We had a few glasses of wine in the bar in the evening and got talking about my first birth with George, which was a planned home birth that turned into an emergency caesarean at 33 weeks. Although MaryAnne knew bits and bobs about my birth, she didn\'t know the full depth of it. She had no idea that I felt like a failure after my caesarean. I told my family\xa0that I felt like a failure, that my body let me down, and most of all that I didn\'t deserve to have children. My feelings were invalidated and dismissed, because I had a "healthy baby". That\'s not how it should be. Clearly this had been on my mind all night, because I woke up with the urge to record a heartfelt episode to go in depth into the birth trauma and associated feelings that led to me having PTSD. Challenging core beliefs "As a chiropractor, one of my greatest fundamental beliefs is that the body is just perfectly designed, and here I was with a body that wasn\'t perfectly designed… that had failed me… that had made it so that I couldn’t have a baby naturally.\xa0It really challenged every single belief that I have" I really struggled with coming to terms with what happened, and how I felt about it. Not just the birth, but the initial feelings toward my beautiful baby. As pregnant mums, I think we all sit and visualise how our lives will be, and what kind of parents we\'ll be too. Nobody sits and thinks to themselves, "I think I\'ll get separated from my baby and not even coo over a photo of him". But that\'s the reality for many of us. It wasn\'t this overwhelming surge of love and affection that I thought it\'d be. I was scared. Petrified in fact. It wasn\'t how birth was meant to be. It wasn\'t how\xa0my\xa0birth was meant to be. Letting go of the stigma There\'s SO much stigma surrounding mental health anyway, but although people talk about PND, I\'d never even thought that you could get PTSD unless you were a soldier or the victim of a horrific crime. I believe that it\'s so important to share stories of birth trauma, PTSD, PND and any other mental health issues surrounding birth & pregnancy. While I\'m totally in support of positive birth, sometimes things aren\'t rosy, and we need to validate that. Feeling like a failure after my caesarean, I\'ve since discovered, is not uncommon. I wish I\'d known at the time. So, if you can think of anyone who could benefit from knowing they\'re not alone in how they\'re feeling, please share this with them. PS -  Here\'s where MaryAnne and I chatted for You\'re Doing Great Mom  Download Episode for Later!  | Child development is something every parent is concerned about - we all want our children to be the best! As\xa0with many health-related issues, we often wait until something is wrong before seeking help. When we\xa0wait until school age tests to be certain how our child is developing, it\'s often past the critical period to be able to see the biggest\xa0change to their brain function. In this episode, I talk to Dr Marty Rosen who teaches internationally on the topic of how skull movement affects brain development in babies and children. Often babies have small but noticeable asymmetries in their skulls, which can alter the way the child\'s brain develops. This is sometimes due to a traumatic delivery, like forceps pressure, sometimes due to sleeping positions, but often the baby\'s positioning inside Mum\'s tummy has a big effect too. As a baby\'s brain begins to develop before he/she is born, by the time of birth, the foundations are in place for this growth and development to continue through infancy. A whopping\xa080-90% of brain growth occurs within those first two years, so this is a really important episode for all parents to listen to. One of the biggest things I hope to do with this podcast is to encourage change before things "go wrong", and Marty is absolutely on the ball with that message too. But be warned,\xa0Marty is an absolute wealth of knowledge, and he talks fast.... really fast! So you may have to rewind back a few times, but I promise you, it\'s worth it. What this man doesn\'t know, is not worth knowing. About Marty Rosen Martin G. Rosen, DC, is a 1981 graduate of Life Chiropractic College.\xa0 He lives and practices with his wife Nancy Watson, D.C and his daughter Erin Rosen, D.C. in Wellesley, Massachusetts. \xa0Dr. Rosen taught his first chiropractic seminar in 1979 and has traveled the world teaching SOT®, pediatrics, cranial adjusting, practice management and chiropractic philosophy and neurology ever since.\xa0 For over 33 years, he has been at the forefront of chiropractic pediatric and specifically pediatric craniopathy.\xa0 He has written multiple books and research studies as well as run a successful family chiropractic practice.\xa0\xa0 Dr. Rosen has dedicated his life and inspired thousands of others in the pursuit of excellence in the application in the art and science of chiropractic. \xa0His "Pediatric Chiropractic Care" book is a "must have" book for those chiropractors looking to become experts in the care of children. He is widely active on social media, and you can find him on Facebook in many forms:\xa0his personal page,\xa0his office,\xa0his paediatric page\xa0and he\'s also on\xa0twitter. In this episode, we discuss:  How a baby’s brain begins to develop before he/she has even been born The formation of synapses (connections) between different parts of the brain begins in utero! Foundations are needed to build the basis for the baby to grow on, and reach developmental milestones At birth we have almost all the raw materials to develop upon 80-90% of brain growth occurs in the first 2 years The survival part of the brain (cerebellum) grows 240% in the first year of life Social developmental milestones are reached as a result of the nervous system growth Psychologists describe the first 2 years as the period for most dynamic growth Why it’s so important to identify children at risk of neuro-developmental delay\xa0within the first year A lot of the issues we are seeing in children at school age actually occurred within the first year of life The health of our future generations is declining due to the onslaught of environmental insults Children need a nervous system that is able to deal with the insults in order to develop appropriately, which is the aim of the chiropractic paradigm Environmental insults can be physical (falls, bumps to the head, junior sports), chemical (air & water pollution, electromagnetic fields from mobile phones and iPads, food), emotional (lack of bonding) & sometimes spiritual The nervous system usually adapts, but sometimes compensates The three parts of the nervous system and what they control within the body: central, peripheral and autonomic How a stretched spinal cord (from forward postures such as children playing on iPads, or even from a straightforward birth) affects the developing brain and body, as a result of changing the tone of the nervous system Compensatory patterns - what they are and how we get them - if we have too many things to compensate for, then we can’t develop as well or as quickly as intended How nerves from the upper neck feed directly into the brain, and while glitches may not show up immediately, as different areas of the brain begin to develop, differences are noticed How an overloaded nervous system can begin to balance once subluxations are corrected Different children with different personalities will show their inability to adapt in different ways, but it all comes down to the same thing - an overwhelmed nervous system How the skull is designed to allow the brain to grow, but with altered movement in the skull bones, the whole system down to the coccyx is affected - this changes the speed of nerve reaction times Slower nerve reaction times may result in slower learning The younger you are, the better the ability to adapt Symptoms aren’t a good indicator of whether a child needs to be checked How birth affects the infant’s nervous system Marty’s preference is to check all babies within 7-10 days Final thought: “It is imperative to have your child’s spine and nervous system checked by a competent chiropractor as soon as possible to make sure that you give them the greatest opportunity to develop their optimum potential: neurologically, immune system, socially, emotionally & physically”  Further research:  Pediatric Chiropactic Care by Martin Rosen, DC www.drmartinrosen.com Journal of Vertebral Subluxation\xa0McCoy Press International Chiropactic Pediatric Association SOTO-USA\xa0 SOTO-Europe  | In this episode of the Pure Natural Pregnancy podcast, Sarah talks to Mark Harris from Birthing for Blokes.

In our modern world, we\'re exposed to technologies and frequencies that our bodies have never experienced in human history, like cell phones, wireless, magnetic fields, and even the electricity in our homes. We don\'t think about these exposures because we can\'t see or hear them in our environment and there\'s been very little rigorous long-term safety testing for their effects on human health up to this point. But there\'s now growing evidence that EMFs actually can cause harm to our bodies and can even affect fertility. Brian has dedicated his career to understanding and educating the public about EMFs and owns a company called Shielded Healing. He and his team travel the country doing home assessments for EMF exposure and making recommendations to help consumers protect themselves during the time it matters most: at night when they sleep!In this episode, Brian shares:The different types of EMFs we\'re exposed to and the specific technologies they come fromHow these frequencies can cause disruptions in our bodies, including with fertility and baby\'s developmentSimple, low-cost steps you can start taking right now to limit your exposure to EMFHow you can get a more thorough assessment of your home environment and transform your bedroom into an EMF-free healing spaceWe also talk about Kristin\'s personal experience working with Brian to assess her home and shield her bedroom space against multiple types of EMF.\xa0You can find show notes for the episode, the studies we discuss in the interview, and links to Brian\'s website and social media here: https://tinyfeet.co/my-podcast/48LAST DAY TO GET $100 OFF FERTILE IN 5 MASTERCLASS!

She shares the very interesting connection between our sex hormones (especially estrogen) and histamine. When you see the word histamine, you probably immediately think of an allergic response. In fact, the primary way we treat allergies in conventional medicine is with anti-histamine medications. But histamine actually participates in A LOT of other functions in the body, including our digestion, mental health, sleep, libido, hormone production, and menstrual cycles. It\'s obviously pretty important, but having too much of it in the body can really cause problems. And if you\'re suffering from things like heavy/painful periods, PMS or PMDD, menstrual migraines, painful breasts, anxiety, insomnia, and allergic symptoms, then histamine definitely needs to be on your radar! Tune in to learn more from Dr. Briden about how histamine is connected to hormones and fertility, how we can sometimes end up with too much histamine in our bodies, and what to do about it. You can find show notes and resources for the episode, along with links to Dr. Briden\'s website, book, and social media on our website at: https://tinyfeet.co/my-podcast/47.Tania Dempsey\'s Mast Cell research paper | In episode 46, we interview fertility acupuncturist, nutritional therapist, and founder of The Fertility Kitchen, Charlotte Grand. She shares some amazing practical strategies we can use to start implementing better nutrition to support fertility and a healthy pregnancy. Most of us have a pretty good idea of WHAT we’re supposed to do to improve our diet, but the HOW is where we tend to get tripped up. So if you’re having trouble ditching junk food, eating healthy on a budget, or even learning how to cook with real-food ingredients, this episode is for you! We start off by talking about Charlotte’s personal fertility journey that brought her to acupuncture, nutrition, and The Fertility Kitchen. And in the rest of the episode we discuss things like:How to train our brains into healthier habits so we can finally leave sugar and processed foods behindSimple ways we can add more variety (AKA nutrients) into our diets without becoming master chefsWhy things like organic, seasonal, and non-GMO matter and how you can eat this way without breaking the bankHow to make healthy eating simple and approachable, even if you’re super busy or just not that into cookingWe also talk a little bit at the end about acupuncture and how this amazing healing modality can support you on your fertility journey.

While the conventional medical model views mental health conditions as "chemical imbalances" that require drug therapy to correct, we view mental health symptoms as a clue to something deeper going on in the body. Contrary to what we\'ve all been taught, the brain is not a separate entity from the rest of the body and there is a complex interplay between the brain, the gut, and the immune system that is not being taken into account in mainstream psychiatry. There are many underlying factors that can either directly cause or worsen mental health issues, and addressing these factors with natural therapies can lead to incredible healing for those who are suffering - often without the unwanted side effects of antidepressant/psychotropic medication. Throughout the episode, we discuss:What depression and anxiety are and the many possible symptoms associated with themThe major factors underlying mental health symptoms and why antidepressant drugs don’t address themHow mental health issues are related to your fertility and why it’s so important to investigate your symptoms before conceivingSteps you can take to improve your mental health and heal your body from the inside out\xa0You can find show notes for the episode and links to all the resources we discuss on our website at https://tinyfeet.co/my-podcast/45.IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are currently taking medication, we are NOT suggesting that you discontinue it! You should never stop taking antidepressant or psychotropic medications without first consulting with your doctor and putting together a carefully monitored plan for tapering slowly off of these drugs. Stopping cold-turkey can be extremely dangerous and damaging to your health.\xa0Take the FREE Quiz: Are You Healthy Enough to Get Pregnant? | Herbal medicine can be a little scary for those that are thinking of having a baby or trying to conceive. You may be asking, "are the herbs safe to take?" "What happens if I get pregnant, will they hurt the baby?" You may just feel overwhelmed with the options and not sure if you\'re making the right choice for your unique situation. In today\'s episode, we go over 8 botanical herbs that are known traditionally and clinically to be helpful in fertility: Black cohosh, Chaste Tree Berry, Dong Quai, Red Raspberry Leaf, Tribulus, Rhodiola, Shatavari, Wild Yam. These herbs are safe when taken is recommended doses from a reputable source. If you find out you\'re pregnant while taking these herbs, it\'s important to work with a licensed practitioner to know what\'s safe to continue. Most of the herbs we discuss should be stopped once you have a positive test.

Infertility is hard - and we’re not going to pretend otherwise. But, like any challenge in life, it’s also an opportunity. As Kristin struggled to understand why she couldn’t conceive, she discovered life-changing information about her health, developed a profound sense of control and responsibility for the wellbeing of her future children, and experienced enormous personal growth, both individually and with her partner.

We\'ve talked before on the podcast about what to expect if you needed to seek out testing or treatment from a conventional fertility clinic, but this week, we want to tell you more about OUR approach to fertility and give you some options that you may not have considered before. Throughout the episode, we discuss:What functional medicine is and how it’s different from conventional medicineWhy you don’t actually have to choose between the two when it comes to your fertilityWhat our intake process looks like and which basic blood tests we recommend all potential clients seek out with their local providersThe 4 functional labs tests we use in our practice and when we typically recommend themHow we combine all the information from your intake and labs to build a completely customized healing protocol just for you!We also talk about the two things we CAN’T do for you through Tiny Feet and share some others ways we can help you aside from becoming a one-on-one client.

Millions of women with supposedly benign breast implants are suffering from mystery symptoms, including unexplained infertility or miscarriage. The vast majority of doctors will never suspect that breast implants could be the cause of their suffering. It takes women years, even decades, to find out that the cause was sitting right inside of them all along. This is what happened to Dr. Haylee and that’s why it’s important to her to tell her story to help spread the word about this important issue. \xa0She offers a unique perspective as a naturopathic doctor who’s also dealing symptoms of BII.\xa0In this episode, you’re going to learn:\xa0Common symptoms related to breast implant illnessWhy breast implants can cause trouble conceiving and miscarriageWhat are the appropriate steps to take if you think you have BIIAnd natural therapies that will help you heal while you are exploring your optionsBII is not curable unless you have an explant surgery – and Dr. Haylee’s is scheduled on August 20th 2019.

Screening for thyroid issues before and during pregnancy is NOT routine practice for conventional medical providers in the U.S. But we consider this one of the most important preconception tests a woman can receive and we advocate for universal screening, especially because not all cases of low thyroid function cause obvious symptoms. In this episode you’ll learn what your thyroid does and why it’s so important for fertility, pregnancy, and baby’s development, the symptoms and possible underlying causes of thyroid dysfunction, how to get the right testing and interpretation for your thyroid labs, available treatment options for low thyroid and how to choose the one that\'s right for you, and how to investigate and address the root cause of your thyroid issues so you can actually heal your body instead of just manage your symptoms.

She talks about her fears over discrimination, postnatal depression, her obligation to champion the need to get talking about fertility in the workplace and the need for organisations to have robust fertility policies in place. \xa0In late 2008 Shelia’s Mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. This led Shelia to start trying to conceive so her mother could become a grandmother. However unfortunately Sheila was given the frustrating diagnosis of unexplained infertility. Sheila decided to pay privately for an IUI and was under the impression from the clinic that she would still be eligible for NHS funding if the IUI was unsuccessful. Unfortunately Sheila was given incorrect advice and local policy meant that devastatingly she was no longer eligible for NHS treatment. Sheila was in a senior position at work and was concerned about divulged her fertility treatment to her employers, in fear that she would face discrimination. It became challenging for Sheila to manage her fertility treatments whilst working, this was particularly difficult as her employers and peers were unaware of her fertility issues. During this time she was also juggling her Mothers illness, and in hindsight is aware that she didn’t consider her own mental health After the birth of her first child Sheila suffered from Post Natal depression. Sheila talks about the correlation between IVF treatment and postnatal depression. Sheila took the opportunity to commence counselling and this she found invaluable and would encourage anyone to take care of their mental health as well as their physical health during IVF treatments. Sheila recounts the time when she started bleeding at 11 weeks and how she broke down at work. Her boss was incredibly supportive and her greatest regret is not confiding in her line manager sooner. Within Sheila’s workplace there was no published Fertility Policy and Sheila believes that these are the conversations that we need to start having. Sheila also feels it is her obligation to speak up about her experiences to help inform future workplace policies. At the prime of her career Sheila felt she needed to step back at work and she now regrets this. Had she not been successful on her fertility journey, she would have been left without a baby and the career she wanted. Making the decision to prioritise her mental health made a huge difference in her subsequent pregnancy and birth of her twins. Sheila recommends women working in the corporate world find someone within their workplace who has previously been through a similar journey. Look to these colleagues for support and help in navigating through their fertility treatments whilst maintaining their career. \xa0 SOCIAL MEDIA Sheila Cameron Natalie Silverman\xa0 Instagram\xa0 Kate Davies\xa0 Instagram\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Meet Amy Bennie , Trustee and Chair of the Daisy Network. Daisy Network is a charity dedicated to providing information and support to women diagnosed\xa0with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency. \xa0We discussed what is Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)\xa0 -\xa0 a term used to describe where the ovaries stop working before the age of the natural menopause. Some women with POI can be as young teenagers. Daisy\xa0provides support and medical advice, local support but also aim to raise awareness among medical professionals. Sadly POI occurs in 1:100 under 40, 1:1000 under 30 and 1:10,000 under 20, however other women may also be diagnosed following cancer treatments for example. It can be difficult to diagnose POI and may be incorrectly diagnosed initially. Symptoms include periods not starting as a teenager, periods stopping, noticing menopause symptoms such as mood swings, night sweats, anxiety, tiredness etc. Diagnosis is obtained by taking a FSH Blood sample and repeat 4 weeks apart Like fertility, POI or the menopause is not routinely discussed in schools and therefore there is a lack of awareness.Treatments for POI include HRT or the Combined Oral Contraceptive pill. HRT replaces the oestrogen that is lacking and helps to protect bone density. Daisy offers a variety of different support networks such as medical support, local support for meet-ups and connect with other women suffering with POI, Private Facebook group. Daisy also has an annual conference called Daisy Day. Daisy Network aims to be the first point of call for women who are diagnosed and encourage early referral from medical professionals once diagnosed. Women who are diagnosed with POI are more likely to conceive with egg donation and IVF.All the Daisy Network team are volunteers. The charity fund raise through their annual conference and by members who do fundraising events such as climbing Kilimanjaro and 100k walks.Majority of POI is spontaneous but it can be hereditary and therefore this makes it difficult to detect and more research is needed to understand POI more. HRT and breast cancer risk – for POI HRT replaces hormone levels that have been lost and does not increase the levels and shouldn’t increase the risk of breast cancer. Most recent study did not consider POI and therefore does not relate to a woman suffering from POI. SOCIAL MEDIA\xa0 Daisy on Facebook\xa0 https://www.facebook.com/DaisyNetwork Instagram Twitter Fertility Podcast\xa0\xa0 Instagram\xa0 Kate Davies \xa0Instagram \xa0 | Adam talked through the new PCOS guidelines, with regards to diet and also the issues around Clomid, explaining he prefers to use Letrozole.\xa0 One of the most common misconceptions he says he still hears is women who have been told they won\'t get pregnant because they have PCOS. When it comes to being overweight because of it, most women can improve their fertility by a 5-10% reduction in body weight.\xa0 Adam talked about how a lot of women end up having IVF when they have PCOS and they don\'t need it. He spoke about Ovulation Induction kits as well as explaining more about a Laparoscopy and thankfully we\'ve moved on from Ovarian drilling - which you will also hear him and Kate discuss.\xa0 Adam also talked about the downside of Metformin being used by women with PCOS and he explained how GP\'s don\'t understand what PCOS is and mistakenly think you have to have severe symptoms however we recognise it is a spectrum.\xa0 You don\'t need all of them just 2 - such as menstrual disturbance and the  Rotterdam Criteria\xa0 We also touched on the ethical issues - which we will aim to discuss more in a future episode.\xa0 Things to consider: PCOS runs in the family - 1st degree relatives so there\'s a 50% of your mother\'s sisters daughter having it. Talk to your sister. Get screened.\xa0 We need to understand normal!

They fell pregnant naturally in January 2015 and then married in April 2015, unfortunately, two weeks before the wedding, at their 12 week scan the couple had found out that the baby they went to see for the first time and very excited about had no heartbeat, they\'d had a missed miscarriage\xa0  One \xa0year later Katy fell pregnant again, but suffered another loss, which was a\xa0blighted ovum and it was at this point Katie discuvered the TTC Community to hear other people’s stories and find support. Katie explains "the strength I gained from some of the battles these women had gone through to get their dream was inspiring to me and has given me the determination \xa0to never give up, given this new found optimism we were ready for our first round of IVF "  The couple we diagnosed with unexplained infertility and were optimistic about the IVF procedure. So far they haven\'t had success with a failed cycle and failed frozen embryo transfer ( FET ) however as they continue on their journey, they came up with making\xa0IVF socks company, to document each stage of the process and add a little bit of fun to the situation. That’s really what these socks are all about. Katie says "Remember what will be will be. so try and enjoy the journey rather than worry about it. That’s how I view things now."  The pair are about to go through another FET and would like to offer a discount to anyone listening to their story.\xa0 Visit their website to get a discount using this code FP25 SOCIAL\xa0 The J Starts here\xa0 Fertility Poddy\xa0 |   I was really looking forward to speaking to Jody Day on the podcast again. I\'ve heard Jody talk numerous times at Fertility Fest and am always struck by her determination and positivity when it comes to talking about her work and her book \'Living the Life Unexpected and Rocking the Life Unexpected\'\xa0 Jody is the founder of Gateway Women, a network for childless women. In our chat we talk about societies’ representation of childless women and how conversations are beginning to change.\xa0 It’s becoming more normal to talk about childlessness due to infertility but being ‘childlessness by other circumstances’ are less discussed. Jody is collating a huge resource of articles and papers on this topic. Gateway Women is an amazing organisation which helps and supports women through her book, by meet-ups across the world, through social media and the Gateway Women Private Online Community. Jody and her colleagues also run workshops and more than 1500 women have attended the workshops. Jodie talks through the obstacles to overcome when facing childlessness – stopping treatment and the fear of ‘giving up hope’ both making peace internally but also for how friends and families react. Giving up hope is the first step and she explains how we need to change the narrative around hope. As Jody says ‘we’re not giving up hope for something terrible’ Childless women in our society are representative as ‘wrong’, ‘evil’ and ‘deviant’. Jody also spoke about the importance of giving women new childfree friends as she has found that childlessness decimates friendships and results in loneliness and isolation. She\xa0feels that perceptions on childlessness will change but it may take another decade. The LBGTQ community have helped to change the way society perceives sexuality, however women without children in the work place is the biggest diversity group that HR hasn’t heard of. Jody talks about the belief that someone who has a child is of more value than those who don’t. Women internalise this narrative and feel shame in believing that they are defective, barren women. Coming up is World Childless Week and I spoke to its founder Stephanie Phillips about her reasons for creating it and you can hear more from her\xa0and find out more about how you can get involved here\xa0World Childless Week\xa0 It runs from 16-22nd September.

After a jampacked few months, Jessica\'s currently has her hit play  Avalanche staring the amazing Maxine Peak, showing in Sydney Do have a listen to previous chats I\'ve had with Jessica on this podcast - starting here\xa0 It was great having Kate speaking with me to Jessica, as Kate is a fellow mountaineer and had all sorts of different questions to ask. So Jessica Hepburn has a background in the arts and as a result of publishing her first book the Pursuit of Motherhood book, found she was being contacted by artists who were telling her they had similar experiences or how much her book had helped them, which is how Fert Fest came to be. It is the first arts festival bringing together dedicated to fertility, infertility, the science of making babies and modern families\xa0 and has really picked up it\'s momentum, being part of The Fertility Show as\xa0Eshre.\xa0 What is amazing about the festival is how it has created the first platform for patients, the public and the profession - a level playing field to discuss what it feels like to go through treatment There are people going through treatment who have infertility issues and people who have got no fertility problems. There are many similarities -\xa0isolation, not knowing\xa0\xa0how your story will end, feeling\xa0envy amongst peers,\xa0feeling you aren’t a natural / normal man or woman\xa0 - Jessica talked about how these are all\xa0common symptoms when\xa0fertility treatment doesn’t work first time\xa0 and\xa0common feelings that everyone shares She described how she is part of a collective of patient advocates, working together to try and make the industry better, which I love and feel chuffed to also be a part of.\xa0 So in her crazy busy schedule, Jessica has very recently\xa0climbed Mount Elbrus in Russia nd then flew back and swam across Lake Windermere as you do! Jessica talked about how in the challenges she has taken on she wants to inspire other people to do is live big and bravely whatever their fertility story is and to know there are many ways of living life She spoke about how it was her childhood dream of swimming the channel\xa0 and the parallels she draws to her IVF experiences - doing these challenges such as how the\xa0result is out of your control - the sea decides if she’ll let you cross her and the mountain decides if she’ll let you climb her and your body decides if it will let you conceive and carry a baby She described her experience of swimming the channel as transformational.\xa0 \xa0I think if you\'ve heard me speak to Jessica before you\'ll agrees she sounds more determined than you’ve ever heard her She spoke about how she is really conscious that we’re only here for a really short amount of time\xa0and how "if you can’t always have the family or the life you dreamed of, there are other routes to happiness\xa0and these challenges have been one for me as have the writing and as have the fertility fest family" \xa0Jessica also discussed with us her concerns about the misconception of IVF being viewed as\xa0one treatment thing and people often wrongly think it’s going to work the first time, but for a lot of people it doesn’t work the first time\xa0\xa0but the cumulative success rates over 3 or more treatments are better and how she\xa0wants people to think this is a 3 treatment cycle - which is what the NICE guidelines suggest.\xa0 SOCIAL MEDIA\xa0 Jessica on Twitter\xa0 Fertility Poddy Kate Davies\xa0 \xa0 | Natalie and Kate chat to Francesca Steyn – Head of Nursing at the CRGH - Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health in London. Francesca is involved with the Sperm, Egg and Embryo Donation (SEED) Trust and she talks to Natalie and Kate about the ‘minefield’ that is surrogacy and how patients considering this option can get the information, guidance and support they need. When we interviewed Francesca she has just been nominated for Surrogacy Professional of the Year 2019 – an accolade she won in 2018, and we are delighted to announce that Francesca has been awarded this again for 2019! Congratulations Francesca! Francesca leads the nursing team at the CRGH but also leads on Clinical Governance and Quality as well as managing the Surrogacy Programme.\xa0Francesca has worked in the field of surrogacy for a number of years and has seen huge growth in surrogacy in the UK. Clinics are a lot more aware of surrogacy services then previously. For people considering surrogacy, Francesca recommends finding a clinic that has experience in surrogacy. The HFEA website provides more information on this and the important things to look out for are -\xa0 if the clinic has a dedicated surrogacy team, how long have they offered surrogacy,\xa0 do they provide open days etc. Legal considerations can be complex but the CRGH have very detailed protocols to follow to make sure that all steps are followed. The SEED Trust provides unbiased and independent support and guidance for anyone considering surrogacy. The website has information and resources for intended parents and donors.\xa0 Making the decision to seek surrogacy at home or abroad. Francesca has seen a change in that patients are considering surrogacy in the UK rather than seeking help abroad, mainly because of greater availability in the UK and more support and resources. LGBTQ community has increased since law changes in 2010. There is a huge amount of support for surrogacy among the LBGTQ community from various organisations and networks. More work needs to be done to normalise and raise awareness of surrogacy among the Heterosexual community. Main challenges to overcome when making Modern Families – the need for more awareness and greater funding. Individuals currently need to fund their own treatment and this is a barrier to many people creating their family. Francesca is involved in Fertility Preservation training with the Royal College of Nursing and BICA. In the UK we have a shortage of donors and Francesca urges people who may be considering this to come forward to find out about what’s involved in donating.

Kate and I spoke with Kelly about her own fertility journey which lasted nearly 10 years and included 2 miscarriages, ovulation induction, 3 IUI and 4 IVF cycles. During her NHS treatment, funding was taken away in her area and Kelly made the decision to start private treatment. At the end of her fertility journey Kelly felt as though she was identified by her infertility. She felt no joy or happiness and felt as though she was a failure. Kelly was having EFT to help her emotional wellbeing and had immense emotional support from her clinic and\xa0felt passionate about helping and supporting others and trained in EFT and NLP. She found that there was lack of support for couples who find themselves involuntary childless and wanting to break down taboos she set up the Dovecote Community online. She now runs a Facebook page and closed Facebook group for women and men who are looking for support and holds Walk and Talk Events nationwide for both the Dovecote and Care Fertility. Anyone struggling with infertility can attend these peer support events. We also spoke about a Buddy System for couples who are at a similar stage of treatment and Skype Support Meetings that Kelly has created to help deal with the inevitability of pregnancy announcements and how people deal with that as well as general coping.\xa0 Kelly talked so honestly and openly about how she has now found resolution. She embraces life and feels incredibly grateful for all the things she has in her life. She and her partner make sure they take the time to nurture their relationship and share experiences with their nieces and nephews. We asked Kelly her advice to her younger fertile self, which is "don’t let infertility define you, continue to do the things that bring you joy and finally remember to have fun and do the things that give you joy."       \xa0 SOCIAL Follow Kelly Da Silva\xa0 facebook\xa0 Instagram\xa0 Walk and Talk Events\xa0 My insta\xa0 Kate Davies insta\xa0\xa0     | This episode shares highlights from several sessions that took place at The Fertility Show in Manchester.

Dr Muhammad Akhtar\xa0- Consultant Gynaecologist, Manchester Fertility and Dr Michael Carrol\xa0 We spoke about Infertility in the Workplace where you will hear me share how I managed my treatment whilst still hosting a breakfast radio show. Hortsense Thorpe -\xa0 Outsource Manager & the creator of the Centrica Fertility Group shares her experience and Aileen Feeney,, former\xa0Chief Executive of FNUK talking about how a lot of us never talk about what we\'re dealing with at work as we are worried it could impact our work and our career prospects.\xa0 Ten years ago, even five years ago you may not have\xa0been able to or felt willing to share your fertility situation with colleagues and employers. We want to break down this barrier and encourage you to and give you the strength to talk about this in the workplace. Hortense and Aileen talk about their hopes for the future and our host Natalie will share how she managed her treatment whilst still hosting a breakfast radio show. The panel\xa0will be happy to take any questions you may have about your rights in the workplace when it comes to taking time off for appointments.

Come along to this session and get invaluable help and support from these incredible women. Andreia Trigo\xa0\xa0Founder of inFertile Life,\xa0Fertility Nurse and NLP Coach shares her personal story and you\'ll hear all about the support groups around the UK available within Fertility Network UK.\xa0 Finally we move onto a conversation about having a Plan B and you\'ll hear from Linder Wilkinson about being a surrogate and part of Surrogacy UK, Mandy Worsley - mum through adoption who also now works to support others dealing with the emotional toll of fertility treatment and Kate Dobb, mother to twins conceived through egg donor.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 SOCIAL MEDIA @fertilitypoddy @fertilityshow \xa0 |  \xa0 The ARGC is a divisive clinic and one I\'ve always been intrigued to understand more about so in this episode Kate and I speak with\xa0 Medical Director, Mr Mohammed Taranissi who talks about ‘IVF Boot camp’, how they manage male factor infertility, and why he feels that the IVF clinics success rates on the HFEA website are misleading. You can also hear my chat with HFEA to find out how patients can navigate their website to help them choose the right clinic for them and discusses the contentious issue of IVF Add-ons. \xa0The ARGC website states that 75% of patients come to the ARGC after having failed cycles elsewhere. Mr Taranissi says that in reality, it is more likely 80-85% patients that are attracted following repeated failures elsewhere. The ARGC is sometimes referred to as ‘The IVF Boot camp’. Cycles are all carefully monitored and changes made as required to maximise the outcome. The intensive monitoring is suitable for couples who have had repeated failed cycles. The ARGC address male issues before starting treatment, particularly in giving lifestyle advice. However, ICSI is generally the course of treatment but patients are assessed on an individual basis. The ARGC offers support in the form of patients understanding their condition and what the ARGC can do differently for them that may not have been done before. ARCG pregnancy rates for under 35 is 80.2% . HFEA has not updated their success rates in many years and Mr Taranissi feels this is misleading and confusing to patients. Mr Taranissi recommends considering Live Birth success rates by age groups and by per cycle started. Consider the most up to date results to make an informed decision. Patients coming to ARGC predominantly have implantation issues. This is an area of focus for Mr Taranissi. Mr Taranissi feels that the science and procedures behind IVF has moved on considerably in the last 40 years and that IVF is no longer a taboo. Natalie also talks to the HFEA about their role and how patients can navigate their new website to find the information they need.\xa0Patients can find information and resources to help them choose a clinic based on 3 ratings - Inspection rating, patient rating and IVF Birth rate. The \'Choose a Clinic\' page on the HFEA website is the only place where all the information on birth rates are compared in the same way, making it easier for patients to make informed decisions. The HFEA uses a traffic light system to explain the benefits and risks of IVF Add-ons based on the strength of evidential research.

We find ourselves working constantly without making much money or the practice that once was a private spiritual life raft has become a public performance and sometimes that makes it lose some of it’s special-ness.\xa0 In today’s podcast episode we are going to talk all about:  Why yoga teachers get burned out Why the structure of our society sometimes makes it difficult to take care of ourselves and our families while teaching yoga What we can do with our teaching schedule to avoid burnout How to know if we should be hustling for more clients and classes OR NOT Why having clear boundaries about time and money go a long way in helping us avoid burnout How to manage Student/Teacher relationships to protect our energy reserves Two different kinds of Self Care and how to know which one you need more of right now Why you need a Sustainable and Sustaining Morning Routine and how to create one  After you listen to the episode I’d love to hear how this episode landed for you! Do you have other Self Care practices that help you avoid or heal from burn out? Tell me in the comments below!\xa0 | The yoga world is a subculture of our society; it mirrors both the beauty and the problems of the wider culture it inhabits. As a group we tend to spend more time teaching and talking about the things we deem “positive” about ourselves and our world, but in the long run this does everyone a disservice, both us and our yoga students.\xa0 If we want our world to be different and better it is up to create that change. And that means we have to talk about the underbelly of the yoga industry. We have to shine a light on the dark, dusty corners and start cleaning up. For that reason I am SO honored and excited to introduce you to the Yoga Is Dead podcast. My friends Jesal Parikh and Tejal Patel created this podcast as a way to jumpstart critical conversations, elevate oppressed voices and expose the problems felt by anyone who isn’t in the “in” crowd of the yoga industry.\xa0 In this episode you’ll hear:  Why they decided to call their podcast Yoga is Dead and the reactions they’ve received so far Why they felt it was necessary for their first episode to cover the racism and cultural appropriation they’ve experienced All about “Karma Capitalism” and why it is a problem How power hoarding shows up in the yoga world and what can be done about it Suggestions\xa0 for being a good ally And so much more!\xa0  Listen here and please share any thoughts or questions below! Myself, Jesal and Tejal will be happy to answer any questions that come up!\xa0 Learn More From Jesal + Tejal:  On the podcast’s website  Resources to learn more about racism, cultural appropriation, privilege and being a good ally  Resources to learn more about Karma Capitalism\xa0 Follow them on Instagram Join the Yoga is Dead Facebook group  | My spiritual practice is one that asks me to wake up to the world as it is.\xa0 My spiritual practice asks me to be strong enough to see the truth about our society and understand my place in it. My spiritual practice values equity for all people and has a deep reverence for our inherent interdependence as a species.\xa0 My spiritual practice has always understood that I am not free until all people are free. The evolution of this path led me to anti-racism work. As I began to see how living in a White Supremacist culture has infected everything I understand about myself and our world I was led to the work of dismantling the White Supremacy that is inside me, as the very important first step in dismantling White Supremacy out in the world.\xa0 As I continued to walk down this path I ran face first into a wall. As a white woman teaching yoga is there any way to do that without appropriating and stealing from a culture that is not my own? I don’t have an answer for that question.\xa0 From my perspective, as a person committed to creating and supporting a better world for all people, it seems important that I get used to the discomfort that comes from living in the questions.\xa0 Many of you are sitting with these questions as well, and I appreciate you reaching out to me to ask for support on this path. In my role as a mentor I am committed to holding space for difficult conversations and asking (hopefully) thoughtful questions.\xa0 We are so so lucky to have Susanna Barkataki joining us on The Mentor Sessions today to bring her lived experience, wisdom and expertise to these questions.\xa0 Susanna Barkataki helps yoga teachers, studios, nonprofits and businesses become leaders in equity, diversity and yogic values so they can embody thriving yoga leadership with integrity and she has worked in teaching and social justice for two decades.\xa0 In this episode you’ll hear:  Why the yoga world so badly need to hear Susanna’s message of diversity and inclusion A breakdown of the language often used in conversations like this. We’ll define:   Decolonization Cultural appropriation\xa0 Diversity Inclusion Dominant Culture And accessibility specifically as it relates to yoga spaces     The main difference between honoring yoga and appropriating yoga\xa0 A conversation about how to update the movement practice and include learnings from modern movement science while still honoring the original teachings What members of the dominant culture can do to transform our society  | Ann Swanson is a certified yoga therapist, mind-body science educator, and author of the beautiful new book,\xa0 Science of Yoga. She is part heart-based healer and part science nerd. With a Master of Science in yoga therapy and roots studying yoga in India and tai chi/qi gong China, Ann uniquely applies cutting-edge research to mind-body practices while maintaining the heart of the traditions. She joins us on the podcast today to talk about the intersection of yoga and science.\xa0 In this episode you’ll hear:  what the yoga world has to gain from diving deeper into the study of science all about the enteric nervous system and how yoga practice might affect it some of the Yoga Myths that were Ann’s favorite to bust ;-) how Ann recommends we teach shapes and movement given that most yoga alignment cues are aesthetic what the research shows about yoga, meditation and chronic pain  \xa0 | Matthew Remski is a yoga teacher and author. \xa0As the survivor of two cults, his work has been pivotal in illuminating the shadows of globalized yoga and Buddhism, and showing that disillusionment and critical inquiry can be gateways to mature spirituality. Matthew has written a new and very important book called Practice And All Is Coming: Abuse, Cult Dynamics, And Healing In Yoga And Beyond and it should be required reading for all yoga teachers. The book explores abuse that took place in Mysore (as well as around the wider yoga world) \xa0AND offers us a path forward through the healing that happens in community. In this episode you’ll hear:  the important difference between intention and impact in the world of oppression and healing the importance of listening to and uplifting survivors stories complex ideas about cult dynamics explained in an easy to understand way and how this conversation might impact all of our teaching why seeing physical opening as a sign of spiritual advancement is a dangerous idea and what can yoga teachers do to dismantle that way of thinking in their own practice and teaching  Learn More From Matthew:  On Facebook On his website Buy the book here  | Erin Jade has been working in massage therapy and yoga/movement instruction since 2004. In 2014 she began to pivot away from traditional asana into varietal movement drawing from the influences of Katy Bowman, Erwan Le Corre, Ido Portal, Igor Burdenko, Moshe Feldenkrais, FRC, Laban Bartenieff, contemporary dance and more. The search led her to movement education and rehab through the lens of applied neuroscience when she discovered education systems Z Health and Applied Movement Neurology Academy. Erin has begun to introduce these concepts to yoga and movement teachers and we are so lucky to have her on the podcast today teaching us the basics about applied neuroscience in yoga and movement classes. In this episode you’ll hear:  why it is important to assess how our nervous system functions and how we might do that how much of our movement ability is driven by our vision and what should yoga teachers should do with that information why what we do in class should translate to functional skills applicable to everyday life and what that might look like in an asana class and much more!  | This is a VERY special podcast episode! To celebrate Episode #50 I decided to turn the microphone around and let someone interview ME. And it’s not just any “someone”. Almost by coincidence two of my very best friends from college, Alece Demeray and Nikki Hay, became yoga teachers many years after I did. We are Yoga Friends now but we still are Regular (Best) Friends first. I knew if I asked them to interview me \xa0you folks would get a glimpse at the real, unfiltered version of Francesca! In this episode you’ll hear:  about the most influential trainings and teachers in my life my current teaching schedule dream trainings I would love to take how I maintain the initial spark of being a student, even though I’ve been a teacher for a long time the systems I’ve built to make sure I maintain my self care practices the parts of my teaching I am most proud of what the next phase of my career might look like some of my worst qualities (!) my favorite TV shows, podcasts and apps  \xa0 | It is common for yoga students to come into class, tell us they have an injury and expect us to be able to modify for them or at least give them ideas as to what they should avoid. If those moments before class make you nervous then today’s podcast episode is for you! Gabby DeLorenze has her Bachelor’s degree in Athletic Training, a Master’s degree in Biomechanics, a certification from NASM as a Certified Exercise Specialist and is also a yoga teacher and today we’re going to talk all about how to offer modifications in a group yoga class. In this episode you’ll hear us talk about a few of the common injuries that people bring into a yoga class and what teachers might suggest for those students including,  Plantar fasciitis Pain in knee, both in flexion or weight bearing Pain in shoulder, especially in overhead movements Pain in shoulder due to rotator cuff injury Pain in lower back  Learn More From Gabby:  On her website On Instagram On  Facebook  Get 20% off her e-book using the code FCPodcast  here', 'chan_desc': "Francesca Cervero is a full-time yoga teacher and yoga teacher's mentor. She has been teaching yoga in New York City and Washington, DC since 2005 and the foundation of her teaching practice comes from OM Yoga Center’s style of alignment-based vinyasa. Her teaching is also inspired by the years she spent in physical therapy, a constant curiosity about anatomy and biomechanics, and her love of Buddhist teachings.Francesca believes that introducing more people to the deeply healing benefits of yoga has the power to completely transform our world and the best way to get more people practicing (mindful, therapeutic) yoga is to raise the bar of professionalism for yoga teachers. She hopes that yoga teaching can be a career path that is respected and allows for sustainable income. She believes that the responsibility is on us as teachers to be worthy of, and demand such respect. It is for this reason she has maintained a thriving business teaching 15 private yoga clients a week and added a full practice teaching and mentoring yoga teachers in The Science of the Private Lesson™.Here is the plan for The Mentor Sessions: Support + Strategy for Yoga Teachers--->Making the deeply healing benefits of yoga and its sister practices more accessible has the power to transform the world we live in. An important part of making smart, mindful, therapeutic yoga more widely available is for all of us to continue to deepen and evolve as teachers.I believe the depth that arises in teaching comes from inquiry and relationship, not from collecting information from gurus. I want the yoga world to have higher standards for quality teaching AND better support networks for teachers, and I want this podcast to be at the forefront of those discussions.I’m here to offer nourishing support to help you feel more confident in your teaching and realistic strategy to help you find more clarity on your career path.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/b3/82/51/b3825181-7e83-11bd-0595-aa24b1ad0a32/mza_3609282151557255983.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2017-10-09'}}

The stress of grief disrupts our sleep cycle, incites cravings for comfort food, and does not usually inspire physical activity. While this is normal behavior in the early period of loss, the sooner we can start taking care of our physical body, the sooner it will become our ally in our mental and emotional health. In this episode of the Mindfulness & Grief Podcast, yoga teacher and wellness expert Jason Wendroff-Rawnicki shares how the death of his sister, Lauren, inspired him to live more fully and honor his lifelong mission of helping others. He offers helpful tips on how to get more sleep, work wholesome foods into your diet, movement into your day, and how smelling something good via aromatherapy can radically shift your mood. We even discuss how media - social and otherwise - can help or hurt your ability to regain emotional balance after loss. Don\'t let all this talk of health and wellness scare you off - both Jason and I know grief is hard! But if you pick just one or two things to try from this episode (which is chocked full of health tips for grief), you will be taking the first and most important step to helping yourself reengage with life after loss.\xa0There is no one-sized-fits-all solution for health and well-being, but there are some time-tested tips and tricks that work.

But what do you do when on top of that you need to raise a grieving family, get everyone to school on time, pay all the bills, and run the household all on your own? These are just some of the challenges widowed parents face. While grief professionals may offer helpful insights, our guest and psychologist Dr. Justin Yopp explains why peer support groups for widowed parents may be one of the most helpful resources for bereaved fathers and mothers. This episode is for widowed parents who are looking for inspiration and practical advice on parenting after loss. Based on insights gained by facilitating widowed parenting groups and academic research, Dr. Yopp offers compassionate guidance that respects each individual\'s journey. His book, The Group: Seven Widowed Fathers Reimagine Life, is based on the “Single Fathers Due to Cancer” project, a group facilitated by Dr. Yopp and his colleague Donald L. Rosenstein at the University of North Carolina. They now collaborate with other colleagues at UNC to run The Widowed Parent project, which is committed to supporting widowed mothers and fathers with children in the home. Proceeds from The Group are all donated back into the project in order to benefit the families.

In the 20th episode of the Mindfulness & Grief Podcast, Karla Helbert explains how the chakra system can act as a model (or metaphor) to help us understand the energetic response to grief and trauma. She also shares tips to find balance during this chaotic time, and even closes the podcast with a guided meditation you can try at home (but not if you are driving please!). Just like having a map or GPS can help you when you are lost in the woods, a system to help you cope with grief can help you feel less overwhelmed and frightened when the tsunami hits. Going beyond the outdated prescribed stages of grief, the Chakras in Grief and Trauma can help you learn to grow through, rather than heal from, your loss. Rooted in her own experience of being a bereaved mother, as well as her yoga training and years of helping others through loss as a licensed professional counselor, Karla Helbert is the author of the Chakras In Grief and Trauma, \xa0Yoga for Grief and Loss, and Finding Your Way To Grieve: A Creative Workbook for Kids and Teens on the Autism Spectrum.

Glenn Kelly (Ron) shares on the job self-care tips, as well insights into how business leaders and colleagues alike can cultivate a grief-literate work environment. A bereaved father and business leader, Ron is the author several books, including Grief in the Workplace and Sometimes I Cry In The Shower. For some, work can feel like a safe haven, a normal experience in the midst of the worst time in your life. But for most of us, the two or five days of\xa0 bereavement leave just isn\'t enough.\xa0The reality is that most of us have to earn a paycheck whether we feel like it or not. After a major loss, work may feel like the last place any of us wants to be. There are many challenges that were not present before, including debilitating brain fog, uncontrollable emotional swells, preoccupation with our loved one and the business of grief, not to mention the unskillful platitudes offered by well-meaning but ill informed colleagues. Over 4 Million active U.S. employees experience the death of a spouse, life-partner, or child every year. Research indicates that in addition to the pain the employee feels, companies are losing an estimated $100 billion in direct and indirect costs due to staff bereavement. But this statistic does mean there has to be a battle between employee and employer. In fact, with Ron\'s help, organizations like Delta Airlines have found ways to support their bereaved employees that benefit both company, employee, and the people they serve, and cultivating compassion and care along the way.

Five years ago, I started a FB page, Grief Speaks Out at\xa0www.Facebook.com/GriefSpeaksOut. It is a loving, supportive international community of 2.4 million people. My book, Grief Day By Day: Simple Practices and Daily Guidance for Living With Loss has been called a soothing balm for a wound and an outstretched hand in friendship. \xa0I have a Master\'s in Counseling Degree and have studied NLP, and hypnotherapy. In becoming fully alive with grief I have produced documentary films and an off-Broadway play. I’m a vagabond who has been to all seven continents. I love being a grandmother. \xa0 \xa0 | In the thirteenth episode of the Mindfulness & Grief Podcast, I interview Molly Hicks, music therapist and bereavement counselor with Penn Wissahickon Hospice in the Philadelphia, PA area, where she serves adult bereavement clients through individual counseling and support groups. During this episode, Molly shares the principles of music therapy, and how music can help you cope with grief and express how you really feel. 13:22 minutes in, you will also get to hear Molly\'s original recording of\xa0Call in the Light,\xa0a song, in Molly\'s words that is "about darkness and light, which is very common in a lot of music and a lot of songs....the person who is grieving can call in a source of light from themselves and also from the memories that they share with their loved one and the bonds that they still have with that loved one." The lyrics are available below! Along with music therapy interventions, Molly also uses her background as a yoga teacher to incorporate gentle poses and mindfulness techniques into her sessions. Additionally, she supports bereaved children and teens each year at Camp Erin Philadelphia, through the visual and performing arts.

Cancer affects 1 in 2.25 people in the United States today, and is quickly on track to advance to 1 in 2. The tendency of most people, once handed a diagnosis of cancer, is to react (understandably) from a place of shock and fear. Dr. Kevin Conners suggests taking the time to do research and consider the alternative treatments available, if possible, before resorting to the\xa0“big guns”—radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery.\xa0Dr. Kevin Conners is the Staff Physician and Clinic Director at\xa0Conners Clinic, an Alternative Cancer Treatment Center in St Paul, MN. He’s been studying alternative cancer care for over 18 years.\u202fHe has written numerous books including\xa0“Stop Fighting Cancer and Start Treating the Cause”\xa0that is available as a free download at\xa0ConnersClinic.com/books.\xa0 \xa0 It would be difficult to find someone who has not been affected in some way by cancer.\xa0 In troubling times like these, isn’t it great to have access to so much\xa0information? Genetic testing can go far to inform us how our unique bodies respond to different natural supplements and protocols when it comes to treating cancer. We have the ability to listen to our bodies and the power to choose our path of treatment. Why not make the most informed decisions possible?\xa0 \xa0 Resources mentioned in this week’s episode include:   Frankincense essential oil\xa0   Lemongrass and cinnamon essential oils\xa0   connersclinic.com\xa0   connersclinic.com/books\xa0   Submit a Recipe to the DIY Dugout by emailing diy@revolutionoilspodcast.com OR by using the Hashtags #diydugout and #revolutionoilspodcast on Instagram.
