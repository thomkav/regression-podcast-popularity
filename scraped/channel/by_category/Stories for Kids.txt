Well, neither had the fairy prince. Of course, he had flown many times before, being a fairy and all. Flying is a fairy’s preferred mode of transportation, as we all well know. If you had wings, wouldn’t you fly everywhere? Yes, exactly.\xa0 Still, falcons fly far higher and faster than any fairy and Haukka was a powerful bird. The prince had been hanging on for dear life to her neck feathers for what felt like hours. Every time Haukka had dipped or swerved he’d been worried that his crown would slide off his head and tumble down down down, far down into the thick forest below.\xa0 As some of you may recall, The Fairy Prince had lost his crown once before, and he was not in the business of ever losing it again. Thank goodness that when he had lost it before, his dear friend Faith had rescued his crown and returned it to him before his mother’s birthday party or oh, the trouble he would have been in! Faith was the loyalist friend anyone could ever hope to have.\xa0 But Faith. Where was she?...

They stop for a rest and run into some pixie problems...\xa0A sweet, funny fairytale story for your kids at bath time, bedtime, car time, and family time.\xa0 An excerpt from today\'s story:\xa0 “Oh no! It’s raining!” said Geraud in a panic, diving under a leaf to\xa0keep his wings dry. “What do you mean, I”m not getting wet?” said the Prince. Iris looked up, “That’s not rain, it’s pixies!” she shouted, pointing to the trees above them. Pixie giggles filled the air. Tee hee hee Tee hee hee... “Oh, not pixies!” cried the Fairy Prince! And there, standing on the branches of the tree above the Prince, as naughty as could be, were a dozen little pixies holding buckets of water. And the next thing the fairies knew, they were pouring water all over them. “I knew landing in the forest du Lutin was a mistake,” sputtered Iris, her delicate purple wings now drenched from the buckets of pixie water. “We can’t fly away with wet wings!” “Tee heee tee heeee thee heeeeeee!” giggled the pixies. “Fairies are so much fun! We love fairies!” And the Pixies were so delighted with themselves that they began to sing a little song that went just like this: "Oh fairies so pretty, oh fairies so wise But when you get ‘em wet these fairies can’t flies (tee hee hee hee) Yes they’ll howl and scold us, but what can they do, For a wee soggy fairy can’t chase after you! Pixies play tricks! Pixies play pranks! Pixies Pixies Pixies, Hooray Hooray! \xa0 Tee hee heee heee teee heee hee!" But the Pixies didn’t quite know who they were dealing with here… this wasn’t just any group of fairies… If you\'d like to hear the story I\'m referring to in this story, listen to episode 36: "The Two Sister and the Wolf".\xa0 Web:\xa0aprileight.com Kids Listen:\xa0app.kidslisten.org Insta:\xa0instagram.com/aprileightsongsandstories Facebook:\xa0facebook.com/aprileight Get your Reward!\xa0patreon.com/aprileight An original Fairytale by April Eight. c2018 All rights reserved.\xa0 | Happy Halloween!

They did not want to get caught breaking the rules about stepping off the high road or touching the Giant King’s animals. And yet, here they were, standing near a giant shiny animal who was making the loudest noise anyone could possibly make. How could they possibly NOT get caught? Still. The girls were determined. They couldn’t just leave him there. Sar dropped her pack on a nearby boulder and carefully approached the golden moose. He was thrashing his huge head around and stomping his powerful hooves in the snow, trying to get his antlers out of branches. “Be careful,” whispered Neiva to her sister. But it was under her breath. There was no way Sar could have heard her over the howls and thrashings of this desperate creature. Sar walking delicately through the snow, singing her most soothing song to calm the creature. (SONG) An original Fairytale by April Eight. c2018\xa0 | Episode 39 is a song episode.

Dilly Brown was a White-Footed Deer Mouse who lived by the dump in an old, leather boot, with his mom and his dad and his brother, Dally. Now, Dilly and Dally were twins born two minutes apart. Gather around for today's fable about truth-telling, and the upset stomach that comes with a lie about pie eating. | Why does the kudzu vine grow SO fast? Before you were born, there wasn’t a stitch of Kudzu in the South. There were vines, of course, vines of every kind.

Listen in to today's tale as Mister Cricket takes us back to a blisteringly hot day in Suavity Bosk when a certain snake, named Slide, learned a valuable lesson in Generosity. Being generous and kind isn’t easy and we hope today's fable shows the importance of those virtues. | Did you know that once upon a time, every possum in the woods (Suavity Bosk) had a tail as black and bushy as a skunk's backside?

Check out all of our episodes at\xa0BUDDYPEGS.COM/PODCAST Creator Notes: We all know kids LOVE to clean up and patiently prepare for big adventures…. Right? Yeah, don’t worry, our son doesn’t either. We hope this episode lays the foundation for family conversations about what it means to ride a safe bike. Even encouraging kids (oh, and adults) to clean their bikes is a big step towards safe adventures on two wheels. Plus, cleaning and maintaining bikes is another great family activity that keeps everyone present with each other. I recently had a chance to hear a live presentation by the actor Geena Davis who is on a mission to bring gender diversity to the entertainment world. Her talk was a real eye opener and we immediately realized we too have focused on mostly boy characters in the World of Buddy Pegs. So you’ll notice now that Pepper has morphed into a female character and is now played by one of our local kids, Claire. If you want to know more about Geena’s work, check out\xa0www.seejane.org. One more thing… Do take a minute to also check out the Jean Tingley creations on our website. We love introducing young groms to amazing creators you may not have heard of before. In fact, I had never heard of him either until our co-writer Bob brought him to our attention. So cool! ~Fitzy | Part 1. What exactly does the Buddy Pegs bike shop look like anyway? Well, in Part 1 of this 2 part episode you can take a look for yourself! The Buddy pegs crew takes you on a tour of the shop complete with Schmiddy’s fantastical contraptions like the Repair Bike Check-in-omatic 4000 (RBC4K for short), and a garage door opener like you’ve never seen before. Oh, and the best part… wait until you hear about the secret entrance to the underground part of Buddy Pegs! Only Watson, Wrigley, and Schmiddy know about that… and now you too!\xa0 Lessons Learned:  Slowing down to finish what you started. The importance of teamwork.  Words to Explore:  Contraption Constellation Suspended Simultaneously  Tips For Your Family Ride: Do you and your kids safety check your bikes before each ride?

Read Full Show Notes HERE.  Check out all of our episodes at BUDDYPEGS.COM/PODCAST\xa0 Creator Notes: When we wrote this episode we had four things in mind:  Describe the shop in more detail (in the past we’ve spent a lot of time describing the characters who work at Buddy Pegs, but not the shop itself). Explain more of the “character flaws” of Watson, the dalmation who is co-owner of Buddy Pegs. Introduce the underground lair beneath Buddy Pegs. Lay the groundwork for an adventure and bigger theme that will evolve in Part 2 of this episode.  Buddy Pegs is not your typical bike shop and we had a blast thinking up all the crazy contraptions that Schmiddy the dog, the cat has built over the years and we’re only getting started. Of course these are the gadgets we wish we had in our bike shop! Imagine an automated track system that quickly moved bikes around the shop - bring it on! Watson is perhaps your typical bike shop owner… if you’re describing me when I was a shop owner. Always moving to the next thing and not slowing down long enough to complete a task has consequences. Boy did I learn that the hard way. And so will Watson in Part 2! We really hope this supports the conversations you’re already having with your kids about the importance of stopping to finish a task and clean up before rushing into the next “thing”. But we can’t have a teaching moment without a little drama and intrigue can we? Finally we get to show you the Buddy Pegs underground lair! As you’ve heard in past episodes, Schmiddy is the mastermind behind Poppawheelie and Captain Endo’s super gadgets. But where and when does Schmiddy make them? Well below Buddy Pegs in his master workshop of course! We have some great things to show you in Part 2…. Just don’t expect any Batmobiles. And finally, what does “check yourself before you wreck yourself” really mean? As you can imagine, Watson is in for a life lesson in Part 2 that will make it all clear. Until then… keep your thumbs up and the rubber side down. ~Fitzy \xa0 \xa0 | Part 2. The exciting conclusion to the first Buddy Pegs holiday episode! Spokesville’s Holiday Bike Drive Extravaganza Extraordinaire (or SHBDEE for short) is in jeopardy! All the right sided pedals of the donated bicycles have been stolen from Top Dog Elementary School. Not to worry because Poppawheelie, Captain Endo, and Master mouse Kabibble are on the case! Find out how the crew works together to recover the stolen pedals from the villainous cat Cheetos and saaaaave the day! Oh, and take your first trip to Macho Taco to find out why those Splendito Burritos are so darn good!   Eclectic Tantalizing Parkour   We suggest wearing your bike helmet if you want to get into Parkour.   The value of \'giving\' transcends beyond the holiday season. You do not have to be a superhero to use your \'super smarts\' to solve a problem. The best way to learn to ride a bike is with no pedals of course!  \xa0\xa0 In this episode, Poppawheelie uses her new call to action when it’s time to roll, “Pedal in Power Position aaaaaannnd, let’s ride!”. Do your kids know what “power position is”? Power position is simply putting your foot on the pedal at the top of a pedal stroke before you push down and start riding. Now head out try it with your kids, maybe you’ll even hear yourself shouting out Poppawheelie’s rally cry! \xa0  Written by Scott Fitzgerald and Bob Berky Performed by Scott Fitzgerald, Bob Berky, and Jannine Fitzgerald.

When you borrow something, bring it back!  Do your kids know what a Penny Farthing is?  From wikipedia: “The penny-farthing, also known as a high wheel, high wheeler and ordinary, is a type of bicycle with a large front wheel and a much smaller rear wheel. It was popular in the 1800’s until the development of the modern ‘safety bicycle’ in the 1880s. It was the first machine to be called a ‘bicycle’.” \xa0 Did you know that left and right bicycle pedals screw into the cranks in different directions? That’s right! Or.. left. Um, yeah. Right pedals screw in righty/tighty and unscrew lefty/loosey. But, left pedals are the opposite!  \xa0 If you want to see more, check out this Park Tools video on how to install and remove pedals:  \xa0 Written by Scott Fitzgerald and Bob Berky Performed by Scott Fitzgerald, Bob Berky, and Jannine Fitzgerald.

È stupefacente constatare come una fiaba possa sopravvivere molti secoli pressoché invariata. Ciò si spiega meglio col fatto ch\'essa riflette una struttura psicologica umana basilare e quindi universale. Anche se una fiaba emigra e in una certa misura si adatta al paese nel quale si radica, il motivo fondamentale resta intatto perché esprime un processo comune a tutti gli esseri umani. Temi come quello della ricerca e della liberazione della principessa, o come quello di una figura femminile che scompare o muore per rinascere e riapparire, si trovano nei miti e nelle fiabe, nelle leggende e in un gran numero di sogni individuali. Raccontata da Filippo Carrozzo | E il ginepro cominciò a muoversi, e i rami si scostavano e poi si riunivan di nuovo, come quando uno si rallegra e fa così con le mani - Jacob e Wilhelm Grimm, il gineproÈ anche di questo che parlano le fiabe, di quella possibilità e del modo di superare la paura che può provocare, trasformandola in un racconto del terrore che spurga e purifica un cuore o una testa troppo gonfi: mia madre mi ha ucciso, mio padre mi ha mangiato, ma io ho raccontato questa storia e sono tornato in vita.Cip cip, che bell\'uccello ha cantato! Il ginepro è una pianta della famiglia delle Cupressaceae, ha foglie piccole e appuntite, fiorisce a marzo e le sue bacche possono essere raccolte in autunno. È un albero con una storia millenaria, compare persino nel vecchio testamento come "luogo" nel quale il piccolo Gesù, assieme a Maria e Giuseppe, trova un riparo e un nascondiglio durante la fuga in Egitto. Anche gli sciamani siberiani lo considerano sacro.Nel 1990 uscì un film dal titolo The Juniper Tree della regista americana, oggi scomparsa, Nietzchka Keene; il film girato in Islanda, aveva come protagonista una giovanissima Bjork; era ispirato alla fiaba dei Grimm.Raccontata da Filippo Carrozzo | La storia del brutto anatroccolo, piccolo cigno nato – per errore – in una comunità di anatre, è una fiaba capace di evocare significati profondi. Nella rilettura di Clarissa Pinkola Estés, lo sfortunato protagonista diviene simbolo delle sofferenze legate alla costruzione di una sana immagine di sé, alle relazioni, alle tante forme di dipendenza declinata al femminile.Versione de "Il Brutto Anatroccolo" di Clarissa Pinkola Estés da "Donne che corrono coi lupi" ed.

La versione attualmente conosciuta è quella scritta dai fratelli Jacob e Wilhelm Grimm in una prima edizione nel 1812, pubblicata nella raccolta Kinder- und Hausmärchen (Fiabe dei bambini e del focolare), evidentemente ispirata a molti aspetti del folclore popolare, del quale i due fratelli erano profondi studiosi.

Da pequena toupeira que queria saber quem tinha feito cocô na cabeça dela (Companhia das Letrinhas)por Werner Holzwarth (Autor) e Wolf Erlbruch (Ilustrador)O problema se apresenta certa manhã, quando a toupeirinha ia saindo de sua toca: quem teria feito cocô sobre sua cabeça? Para esclarecer o enigma, ela interroga todos os animais que encontra no campo: o cavalo, a pomba, a vaca, o porco... E os diversos bichos suspeitos, para se inocentar, exibem os respectivos cocôs à toupeira: há aqueles pequenos, de animais pequenos; há os de formato peculiar, etc. - cada animal corresponde a um excremento diferente. Até que, finalmente, graças à ajuda de uma dupla de especialistas - duas moscas pretas -, a toupeira encontra o culpado e dá um jeito de se vingar condignamente. As crianças adoram.
