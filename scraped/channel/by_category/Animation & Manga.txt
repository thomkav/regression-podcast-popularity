More details and photos can be found on our homepage –\xa0https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/06/toy-story-4-spoiler-free-review.html | There is so much detail that is put into every pixel on the screen — but, why does Pixar do this? Ling Tu (Sets Shading Lead) mentions in our session at Pixar that by putting all the rich detail into the backstory of everything that you see, they\'re able to enhance their stories. If everything visually looks as you\'d expect (set locations like a carnival or a porcelain character with tiny cracks), your mind looks right past those things and you can dive right into the story because everything visually is so familiar. Listen in as Craig Foster (Graphic Arts Director) and Alex Marino (Characters Shading Lead) also dive into what makes a Pixar film shine —\xa0oh and don\'t forget a discussion into all those hidden Easter Eggs that populate the film —\xa0there are hundreds in Toy Story 4. 00:00 — Episode 66 Kickoff 01:14 — Pixar Trivia. 03:24 — Love the Disney Parks, do you help plan your friend\'s vacations, visit Destination Mouse to become an agent. 08:20 — The Final Toy Story 4 trailer is hitting on May 21, get ready. 12:32 — Want to watch Toy Story 4 early or catch a sneak-peek, here\'s how. 18:14 — Bo Peep is coming to Disney parks this summer, get a look at her in-park design. 22:54 — What is happening with Pixar in New York City? 31:03 — Our interview with The Pixar team — It\'s all in the details. 1:05:21 — After the interview discussion. 1:10:44 — 1-on-1 interview with Craig Foster and Ling Tu. 1:17:48 — Wrapping up the show. Stay tuned to PixarPost.com all week for the latest Pixar news. T.J. and Julie | In episode 65 of the Pixar Post Podcast, we dive into the full discussion with Josh Cooley and Mark Nielsen — actually answering 15 questions (of which we highlighted 7 above) all about\xa0Toy Story 4.  Before we dive into the episode fully, we also highlight some of the latest news from the studio — show notes below.  We kick off the episode with Toy Story trivia and then offer a high-level overview of our trip (highlighting all that we\'re going to share over the next few weeks). At 15:28 into the episode, we cover the recent trip we took to Canada to visit Toys R Us and the product videos we\'ve been having a blast creating.  At 25:34 into the show, we discuss the\xa0Toy Story 4\xa0French premiere at the Annecy Film Festival on June 14 and at 28:02 we discuss the new\xa0Toy Story themed table-service restaurant\xa0which was recently announced for Disney\'s Hollywood Studios. At 31:56 we talk about\xa0Mychael and Jeff Danna scoring\xa0the upcoming (March 2020) release of\xa0Onward\xa0and then dive into a follow-up discussion on Disney+ and the\xa0Monsters at Work\xa0show (at 33:44). We also touch on Billy Crystal\'s historic honoring at the Grauman\'s Chinese Theater and his impressive nod to Mike Wazowski (at 40:30). Finally, before the interview, we provide some updated comments to our prior podcast (episode 63) asking if Pixar\'s short films are no longer happening and now transitioning to SparkShorts exclusively.  The fantastic conversation with Josh Cooley and Mark Nielsen kicks off at 46:51 into the episode. Listen along as they answer 15 questions over 30 minutes to dive deep into\xa0Toy Story 4. | In Episode 64 of the Pixar Post Podcast, we chat with Kelly Bonbright (Script Supervisor on Incredibles 2), dive into Toy Story 4\xa0news and of course start the episode with Pixar trivia.  The episode kicks off with T.J. putting Julie to the test with some Presto-inspired trivia — the theme of Presto\xa0was chosen since the Funko of the lead rabbit, Alec Azam came out a few weeks back. Additionally, we talk briefly about the opening of  Lightning McQueen\'s Racing Academy and the latest Toy Story 4 news (Tony Hale playing Forky, Don Rickles voicing Mr. Potato Head, the Toy Story 4\xa0US /  International trailer and more). KELLY BONBRIGHT INTERVIEW In our interview with Kelly Bonbright you\'ll learn all about her journey to Pixar — how she started in Consumer Products and eventually moved into the Script Supervisor role. You\'ll learn how the film is broken down into more manageable segments, funny sequence titles, and even some fun-facts.  One of those fun facts was that Incredibles 2\xa0had 59 total story sequences in the final film, but there were 121 omitted story sequences — that\'s a lot of awesome content and ideas that we still haven\'t seen! Listen to the entire episode below for even more great facts and learn what Kelly believes are the top skills you need to be a Script Supervisor. | In Episode 63 of the Pixar Post Podcast, we discuss Pixar\'s SparkShorts (and offer our rankings of Purl, Smash & Grab, and Kitbull). In addition, we talk about if Pixar will continue to release feature film short films —\xa0especially since we haven\'t heard anything about a short film for Toy Story 4. We also discuss Toy Story 4 news and when will the next trailer be released (you know, the one that\'s been rumored for a long time), the trailer which was shown at the Disney Annual Shareholder meeting, the upcoming book releases, and toy releases. Also, we chat about the possibility of starting a Patreon, we expand on the return of our podcast and how to listen to the episode with chapters to skip sections. | In episode 62 of the Pixar Post Podcast, we chat with Toby Chu, the wonderful composer of Pixar\'s short film, Bao. Additionally, we discuss the Pete Docter impersonator on Twitter (to kick off the show),\xa0Purl, the second short film in Pixar\'s Experimental Storytelling initiative (at 5:21 into the episode), and the box office successes that Incredibles 2\xa0has achieved (11:18). Incredibles 2\xa0is currently the third highest grossing animated film of all time, will it reach Frozen\xa0to become the top animated film? We break down the numbers. The main portion of the interview is our interview with Bao composer, Toby Chu (16:23). It was so great talking to Toby as we learned about his origins and passion for music, how he turned "no" into motivation to continue trying, and how the short film mirrored his life so closely. Did you know that he had to submit a demo for Bao? We get geeky about Pixar and discussed how much it meant to him that he was involved with the project, what it was like walking into the studio, and working with Domee Shi and Becky Neiman-Cobb (among others).

INCREDIBLES 2 FILM REVIEW: I know this is going to sound "sales-y", but Incredibles 2\xa0is incredible. It is high-paced from the opening moments of the film and doesn\'t let up until the final scene — but more importantly, when the film does take breaks from the action, there are also tender moments with important character arcs and big comedic scenes.\xa0  STORY & IMAGERY: The film feels very balanced from the story perspective and it is so much more than just a simple role-reversal (i.e., it\'s not just a Mr. Mom story). The animation is gorgeous (as to be expected) and the direction and layout of the film are stunning. I\'ll need a few more watches to really let this soak in, but my initial reaction was that the direction is one of Pixar\'s best — the angles and camera choices paired perfectly with the visuals on the screen.\xa0 CHARACTERS: With any sequel, you have a well-defined set of characters that audiences will be expecting a lot from. \xa0As mentioned above, in addition to the vastly-improved visuals over 14 years of technical advancements, it felt like we were able to see the Parr family as they were intended — with hair rendered to perfection and outfits that popped off the screen.\xa0 \xa0 Jack-Jack is a total scene-stealer and definitely generated the most laughs of any character (Dash being a close second). Violet won\'t let fans down and steps up in a big way to help the family during battles (wait until you hear the sound her forcefields make when she throws them). \xa0 Another fan-favorite, Frozone, always seems to be there when you need him (well, Honey doesn\'t think so). He\'s there to help Bob and Helen realize they need to make a change at the beginning and jumps right in to help with Jack-Jack when Bob is at his wit\'s end. \xa0  So, what about the new  wannabe supers? They\'ll certainly leave you wanting more as they don\'t have a lot of lines or interaction overall — but they certainly take advantage of their screen time when present. Let me also just say that Reflux (the senior-aged super) is my favorite of the bunch — he can often be found resting or holding his belly while cracking an unintended joke. \xa0 That\'s not to say the other new characters aren\'t also great — we describe them in a lot more detail in the episode (player above). The Screenslaver is also another superb character who "could" cause young viewers to get a little scared (Film is rated PG). The action when he\'s on screen really captivated us and you even get a few Bane vibes (Batman) when he gives a hypnotizing monologue. Is he on the same level as Syndrome? You\'ll have to wait and see. \xa0 We have so much more to say in our podcast — check it out above and let us know your thoughts.

Earlier, we  shared an article that dove into how the team created the Parr\'s new home in the film and now we\'re going to share the entire 40-minute interview that explores the home, the cities in the film, as well as the research behind the design choices which were made. SHOW NOTES: At the beginning of the episode, we chat about all-things Incredibles 2\xa0(no surprise) and highlight the Pixar Post Forum and the breadth of conversations going on — from sharing bus advertisements, to concerns about continuity between the two films, if you haven\'t signed up or shared your views, check it out. Next up, we discuss the  Incredibles 2\xa0soundtrack being available for pre-order as well as our thoughts on Michael Giacchino\'s punny titles. We also follow up on two recent posts that we completed where we dove into  The Art of Incredibles 2\xa0book as well as some early  Easter Eggs which have been spotted in the film (the reused Chinese food takeout box and the famed A113 has been spotted). There are quite a few early-screening opportunities for Incredibles 2\xa0and we list out at least 18 different choices you have - (D23 Gold Member Gatherings, D23 Gold Member Complimentary Tickets, AMC Double-Feature tickets and even some options at AMC IMAX theaters as early as June 6. Before we get to the main interview with the Pixar crew, we also shared details on the amazing marketing of the Parr family home listing on  Zillow. INTERVIEW: The main portion of this episode (starting at 30:20) is our interview with Ralph Eggleston (Production Designer), Bryn Imagire (Shading Art Director), Philip Metschan (Visual Designer) and Nathan Farris (Sets Supervisor).  Listen in as they share wonderful details about how they held back the animation quality of the new film at the very opening of the film so it wouldn\'t be as visually jarring if someone watched The Incredibles\xa0and immediately wanted to turn on Incredibles 2. They also discuss some amazing details about how the crafted complete cities for the film (even some buildings in the background). \xa0 Chat about\xa0Incredibles 2\xa0with other Pixar fans in the\xa0Pixar Post Forum dedicated to the film. | In episode 59 of the Pixar Post Podcast, we share our complete interview with Incredibles 2 writer/director, Brad Bird and Producers Nicole Grindle and John Walker. Along with the interview we share our thoughts on our two-day visit to Pixar Animation Studios earlier in April to discuss the film. We talk about many of the insights and details we learned as well as our high-level thoughts on the 22 minutes of footage we screened. Throughout the podcast, you\'ll learn about many details of the film\'s process, from the reason why the Incredibles family has the powers they do, to why the film swapped release dates with Toy Story 4. Additionally, you\'ll hear as we inquired which returning vocal actors (and which new vocal actors) really knocked it out of the park and why the film didn\'t have a time jump (since it picks up right where the first film left off). Oh, and have you ever wondered if you\'ll see Honey (Frozone\'s wife) in Incredibles 2? Listen for all the fantastic details. Check out even more details regarding our visit to the Studio on our homepage, PixarPost.com.

Specifically, this episode is basically about everything that wasn\'t adapted into the anime version. (You\'ve been warned.) The three dive into more comparisons between the anime and manga, discuss some responses from listeners about their favorite host club boys (y\'all are such haters about the twins, you know that?), talk about why there aren\'t more reverse harem series of late, and have a 40-minute Shipping Corner.

What the next episode is going to be about is still a mystery. | Covers volumes 1-9 of OURAN HIGH SCHOOL HOST CLUB by Bisco HatoriBisco Hatori’s breakout hit has made everyone laugh at pretty rich boys and their host club hijinks for over a decade. At the same time, it’s got a fair amount of problematic takes in it. So should OURAN be considered a must-read classic? OURAN superfan Rose Bridges and manga reviewer Aisha Soleil chat with Shojo & Tell host Ashley about who their favorite boy is (lots of unpopular opinions abound, but we can all agree that Haruhi Fujioka is the best part of this manga) and dissect the ups and downs of Ranka’s portrayal as a drag queen. Of course, there\'s also plenty of talk about gender being a performance, social class being a different kind of performance, and how the facade of the Host Club lets characters be their authentic selves.

What the heck’s a Phantom Thief, and what does it have to do with Jeanne d’Arc? Wait, God and some angels are here, too? There’s time travel? Long-time Tanemura fan Laura Spicer, Shojo & Tell host Ashley, and begrudging participant Asher Sofman delve into “Arina’s Christianity fanfiction” to discuss purity politics, how the anime compares to the manga, and how everyone in this manga got with the wrong person except Finn Fish and Access Time. (Chiaki doesn’t deserve Maron! HE DOESN’T DESERVE ANYBODY!) Also, did you know that Jeanne d’Arc and Eve (of Adam and Eve fame) are the same? Yeah. You’re in Tanemura land now.

In a poll about which CLAMP series we should cover next, Tokyo Babylon came out victorious. We’re here to give the people what they want, so on this episode, Shojo & Tell host Ashley and her journey-through-all-of-CLAMP buddy Asher Sofman answer many listener questions, like: Does Seishiro love Subaru? Why is Hokuto so great? What’s the true nature of evil? What were our favorite cases? This is a heavy episode to go with a heavy manga. Watch out for the turn about 30 minutes in.

(Can’t imagine who wins this war.) Aisha Soleil of MommaLuvsManga tells Shojo & Tell host Ashley what makes EVERYONE’S GETTING MARRIED stand out among other josei fare (the feminism is strong here!) and both constantly dunk on the love rival, Kamiya, for being the worst. Aisha and Ashley also lament that there weren’t enough sexy times in this manga, even though there was a PRIME opportunity for Asuka and Ryu to show off their sexting skills.

From being bitten by snapping turtles when you were little. That is the whole premise of this comedy from Meca Tanaka, and for such a quick, silly series, it really is delightful. The revenge that Leo, the boy with the turtle butt scars, wants to exact on his childhood friend and crush Tenma of course turns into true love. You’ve seen all these tropes before, but not quite with this amount of disregard and subtle subversion.

How pleasant is it to see a story about characters in a relationship through 97.892749%* of the story, instead of having a series of miscommunications preventing them from dating?

OK, honestly, Ashley mostly just rants about how Daiki is perfect and how he was robbed in this manga, while Kelly details how perfect Mao and Hiro’s relationship is. Both express shock and dismay at how, in a manga full of crummy characters like Mao’s dad and Sugimoto, Mao’s mom somehow ends up being the worst of them all. Both appreciate the understanding Mao’s dad and Hiro’s sister, Hina, have. There’s also a long discussion about the woes of publishing quiet romance manga that never get the hype they deserve.Just one more time, for emphasis: DAIKI IS THE BEST.Click here for a transcript of this episodeREFERENCESHouse of the Sun is available from Kodansha USA (digital only)Spoilers for The Hunger Games abound at ~1 hr and 5 minutes in.

The Otaku Summit crew talks about all the bad anime they have seen and they also talk about how one person has always been there recommending the BS.The new season reviews start off with Fire Force (31:00), The anime does a really good job on setting up the world and giving us enough to hook us in to enjoy the story and characters. The other big anime that came out this season is Dr. Stone (48:33), Chaos talks about how he kinda think this anime is being a little overhyped but enjoys that it is something different from a lot of other animes. The last anime that gets reviewed is Demon Slayer episode 14 (59:40), Steve and Chaos talk about how this episode was probably their worst one because nothing was happening and how a new character is annoying.

He meets the landlord who tells him of the suspicious types, the drunk Yoshikawa who is still unemployed after a leg injury, Mrs. Tezuka, a mentally unstable woman in apartment 783 who walks around at night pushing the pram of her dead child. A gigantic man with a mind of a child, nicknamed Little Yo, he was accused of child molestation. Then there’s Shojiro\xa0 a.k.a old sho, an old senile man who sits outside. We also learn about Tsutomu Sasaki, an underachieving student who still lives with his parents. Yamagawa sends two policemen to patrol at night but one goes missing, his gun is never found. Eventually Yamagawa arrives alone at the complex and confronts the killer. Knowing that the killer is collecting trophies, Yamagawa gives him his pager. The killer is petty and breaks the pager using his psychic powers. Yamagawa runs after the psychic killer. He runs up the tower of apartments and hears the killer prying into his mind. Taunting him on every doubt and teasing him. When Yamagawa makes his way to the roof he finds the door is already open and he hesitates to step forward. There he sees Old Cho playing with the gun as if it were a toy. \xa0 One morning later, a new kid on the block arrives, her name is Etsuko, during her arrival Old Cho causes a baby to fall from the tower block. The child is saved by Etsuko and having read old cho’s thoughts she tells him off. Etsuko quickly makes friends with the residents but having an affinity for outsiders she chooses to play with Yoshikawa’s son, the lonely Hiroshi and Little Yo. As the sun falls Etsuko quickly makes her way to the shop, during this time Tsutomu Sasaki spends the knife choosing to craft model planes instead of study. \xa0 Cho takes control of Tsutomu and forces him to confront Etsuko on the elevator, failing to kill her with his craft knife, Tsutomu turns the blade onto himself and cuts through his own neck. Etsuko is hospitalised across the street. After seeing Yamagawa’s ghost, inspector Takayama brings a shaman to the housing complex but the shaman becomes overwhelmed by what she feels, unbeknownst to Takayama, Etsuko is making an attempt on empowering Old Cho from her bed window but is easily distracted by her mother. \xa0 At night, Yoshikawa is caught under control by Cho and is given the policeman’s gun so to kill Etsuko. Little Yo and Hiroshi do there best to hold him off and protect her whilst she hunts down Old Cho. It becomes clear that Cho struggles to fight her, he decides to create a gas explosion all around the housing complex.

"What I do is go in and make bad scenes that much worse. I loved the movie of Battle Royale, and also love the manga. I just wanted to do it right. I wanted to do justice to it, and I knew I couldn\'t get away with doing a straight translation, because it would be horrifyingly bad."\' – Keith Giffen \xa0   §\xa0 There isn\'t a reality TV show aspect   §\xa0 Sakura doesn\'t make any bets prior to the program   §\xa0 Izumi was at the reef before Kiriyama and the rest arrived. This means Kiriyama would have flipped the coin on meeting Kazumi and way before the others arrived. It also means there was no allusion to rape what-so-ever.   §\xa0 Originally Niida makes up excuses for his actions and isn\'t as psychotic as he is in the English version.  \xa0  Basically, Keith Geifen makes it a lot darker than the comic needs to be.  \xa0  \xa0  Differences between other adaptations:  \xa0  ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yonemi Kamon is an original character that replaces, Kinpatsu Sakamochi in the novel and Kitano in the movie.  ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In the movie, Kazuo Kiriyama is one of two transfer students, the other is Shogo Kawada.

Now only 4 remain… but that’s still 3 too many. \xa0 Nanahara, Noriko and Kawada team up to defeat Kazuo Kiriyama, the most dangerous competitor of the students. Nanahara makes the killing shot, as he watches Kiriyama die, Nanahara expresses regret and wishes that he could have saved him. Kiriyama’s final words being “I can feel again”. \xa0 Kawada takes Noriko and Nanahara to the end of the island by the edge of the cliff. He pulls his gun on both of them and wins the game. \xa0 He is escorted off the island by boat, he is not given any aid or chance to clean himself before Mr. Kamon enters the cabin to question him. Kamon suspects Kawada for faking the death of Noriko and Nanahara, his evidence to support this suspicion is that documents about the explosive collars and the chosen class were hacked into before the game began. he tells Kawada that helicopters are flooding the island with poison as they speak and pulls a gun on Kawada. \xa0 Mr. Kamon is distracted due to Nanahara’s ambush on the boat. Kawada kills Kamon with a pencil to the neck. He goes onto the upper deck where he finds Nanahara and Noriko have kept the guards subdued and tied down. When one guard breaks loose he attacks Kawada but Nanahara takes the bullet as Kawada shoots the guard’s hand off. Nanahara is protected by the Kevlar vest he took from Kiriyama. The 3 send the guards into a dingy and cut them loose. \xa0 As Kawada teaches Nanahara how to control the ship he succumbs to the sustained gunshot wound from Kiriyama. Kawada dies on the ship. \xa0 Both Noriko and Nanahara become wanted criminals during the Christmas holidays. They discover Kawada’s plan was to die in that game but rescue Shinji Mimura, in doing so they would declare war on the program. Mimura’s aunt is kind enough to secure a boat to the U.S. for Nanahara and Noriko but before they leave Nanahara spies on Miss Ryoko to see if she is safe and Noriko calls her mother.

Kawada realises that Kiriyama will arrive at any second, following the smoke trail and bird signals meant for Sugimura. Kawada’s makeshift alarm is triggered and the chase begins. \xa0 The chase leads them using cars to rush through the island. Kawada is driving the heavier vehicle and decides to use it to ram into a head on collision with Kiriyama along with suppressive gunfire to take out his tires, a la a game of chicken. They use their remaining rounds of ammo to blow up Kiriyama’s car. \xa0 Kiriyama survives, having bailed out of the car before the crash and explosion. He finds another car and the chase continues, this time taking them through the site where Mimura died and finally to the site where Kiriyama first ambushed them. \xa0 Kawada uses this place to get hold of the shotgun. He uses it to get a surprise attack on Kiriyama, sending his car flying and shooting Kiriyama mid-air. \xa0 Noriko and Nanahara walk away from their car. Noriko spots something glistening in the sun as Nanahara speaks to Kawada. Kawada is shot. Kiriyama rises from a prone position with a damaged Kevlar vest showing under his torn shirt. Noriko shoots Kiriyama in the cheek with the gun she found, it shocks him, a sensation of bright colours has him feeling rage at Noriko. He remembers how his life was like before everything felt grey to him. A child prodigy, amazingly gifted with everything, including a kind and compassionate personality. Until a car crash gave him brain damage that is. \xa0 As Kiriyama retaliates Nanahara remembers the dart that Sugimura crafted for him and he uses this on Kiriyama to stop him once and for all. Sugimura’s spirit is with him through this moment. The spirit to protect the one you love. \xa0 \xa0 Instagram –\xa0 weappreciatemanga.co.uk Twitter - @RealJamesFitton Website – Weappreciatemanga.com Email – Weappreciatemanga@gmail.com | Battle Royale vol. 13 \xa0 Art by Masauki Taguchi Story by Koushun Takami Translation by Keith Giffen Talking about Kiriyama vs Soma!

How can a man win against someone who is already dead on the inside? How do you fight someone who does not feel pity, remorse, frustration or fear? Sugimura must find answers to these questions if he is to defeat his enemy, Kazuo Kiriyama. A hard task when Kiriyama observes that Sugimura is having the flight or fight instinct kick in. An adrenaline rush has Sugimura vomit but the fight is evened out when Kayako threatens Kiriyama. \xa0 Sugimura harnesses the power of chi and enters a flow state, Kiriyama mimics Sugimura’s power and launches him into a tree. As the fight continues Sugimura is launched further, a brutal blow landed from behind. Kiriyama picks his gun up and attempts to kill Kayako only for gunfire to hail down on him. Sugimura literally allowed himself to go with the flow and roll with the punches, so that Kiriyama would launch him far enough to the machine gun that was previously dropped. \xa0 Kayako runs to Sugimura and in this moment, he confesses his love to her. Kiriyama creeps up on them. Sugimura is late to realise that Kiriyama acquired body armour before the fight. \xa0 Immediately Sugimura regrets confessing his love as Kayako chooses to die by his side. He watches her die and Sugimura dies soon after. \xa0 Later that day, Mitsuko Soma finds a house to wash herself and masturbates in the lounge. Kiriyama is in the neighbouring house and suturing a gunshot wound he sustained during Sugimura’s fight. \xa0 The remaining contestants, Noriko, Nanahara and Kawada stay together and brace themselves for what’s to come. Kawada draws a Rorschach test consisting of Kanji symbols and philosophises on the nature of evil. He deduces that Soma became sick and would laugh at the test but Kiriyama is different, a sociopath that does not laugh. He hopes that the gunshots he heard was a fight between Soma and Kiriyama. But he also believes that Kiriyama will kill Soma and Sugimura. \xa0 Instagram –\xa0 weappreciatemanga.co.uk Twitter - @RealJamesFitton Website – Weappreciatemanga.com Email – Weappreciatemanga@gmail.com | Battle Royale vol. 11 \xa0 By Koushun Takami and Masayuki Taguchi With English translation by Keith Giffen \xa0 WARNING: EXPLICIT CONTENT! \xa0 It starts looking like Rocky with a slice of Dragonball in here. \xa0 Topics: \xa0   ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The art work and use of tone. \xa0   ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The pacing of the entire volume (like Stallone’s Rocky) \xa0   ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Kiriyama vs Sugimura \xa0   ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Kayako’s broken family life. \xa0 \xa0 Pop culture references:\xa0 \xa0   ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Dragonball z – Kayako mentions it when describing the energy she emits, “Chi energy” \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Synopsis:\xa0 \xa0 The announcement of 7 students recently killed during the program motivates Sugimura to find and protect Kayako. Between his martial arts classes, Sugimura would watch Kayako perform her flower arranging and it was during this time he found her attractive. Only later did he develop loving feelings towards her, when he took a stray kitten into class. Sugimura struggled to take care of the kitten until Kayako noticed, she helped him nurse the kitten and gave him advice. Kayako herself reveals that she was afraid of him, due to hearing the noise from his martial arts class, one room above her flower arranging class. Seeing his sensitive and compassionate side had changed that. \xa0 Now Kayako is a victim of the Battle Royale as is Sugimura and although he successfully finds Kayako it is obvious that she is frightened. In a display of trust, Sugimura throws down his gear and weapons. He tells her about the cat, the name he gave it, which was in her honour and the books he read so to help it, as she suggested. Kayako puts down her gun and the two team up. \xa0 Sugimura tells Kayako about their fellow students, Kawada’s plan to escape their prison island and the need to join him and his group with Noriko and Nanahara. Sugimura also talks about the dangers they face. About his encounters with Mitsuko Soma and Kazuo Kiriyama as well as the skills he has to protect her. And although Sugimura does have skill, he lacks resolve. \xa0 He speaks of one occasion where during a gym class, the judo teacher would bully him and demand a demonstration since he was not Sugimura’s personal sensei. The class could see that Sugimura did not have the resolve to fight back. And when one of the intelligent students humiliates the teacher, this vexes him enough to pick on more students. Including the mild mannered Kiriyama, who not only had the resolve and disregard to fight back but did so with the help from only reading a manual. Sugimura does not tell what happened next so not to frighten Kayako, although it became school rumour. Kiriyama went for the eye and went on to mutilate and cripple this teacher in front of the class. \xa0 Kayako demonstrates her ability to harness taichigong energy, long thought to be the stuff of fiction and martial art myth. She remains trustful to Sugimura even if Sugimura has never explained why he’s risking his life for her. Sugimura reasons that it would be best to confess his feelings for her sooner than later. The moment is wasted however as Kayako spots Kiriyama on the offensive. \xa0 Sugimura and Kiriyama begin their fight to the death. Sugiumura uses his dart to disarm Kiriyama of his guns and goes for the chi powered strike he used in their first encounter. This time it fails, as Kiriyama uses his own chi to blast Sugimura’s hand away. \xa0 Kiriyama becomes offensive, getting an eye poke on Sugimura’s right. Sugimura starts to anticipate the next moves and counter attacks. Kiriyama responds by being defensive. Which sends Sugimura into a panic and gets his fingers inexplicably cut off. During Sugimura’s wandering thoughts Kiriyama picked up the dart.

In the original novel she is Monotheistic, and worships Ahura Mazda (derived from ancient Iranian religion Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism, derived from Avestan word for wisdom) \xa0 Synopsis: \xa0 The most optimistic of the student contestants, Shuya Nanahara is nursed back to health by Utsumi’s gang of girls. When a bowl of soup meant for Nanahara is poisoned it breeds mistrust in them, resulting in a massacre. Nanahara survives by being locked in the upstairs bedroom of the lighthouse. The girl who is responsible for the poisoning is Yuko Sakaki. \xa0 None understand Yuko Sakaki more so than her parents. At home her mother looks at her photo album, the father is watching TV in the hope of seeing his daughter survive. When a horror movie appears on TV he switches it off. A force of habit due to Yuko’s nervous nature and belief in the devil. Her parents have had to deal with Yuko’s trauma of seeing boys fight in her class, knowing that she is now in a genocidal program has forced their denial to turn to grief. \xa0 With 9 contestants left, Nanahara makes his way downstairs and confronts the paranoid and frightened Yuko Sakaki. She runs off upstairs to escape Nanahara, stopping to fire at him. Whilst at the top the recoil of her gun causes her to fall. Nanahara rescues Sakaki before she experiences an epithany. Having believed that Nanahara was a demon, she realises that her inner demons, her paranoia, have caused her to hurt the ones she loves. She jumps from the lighthouse, choosing suicide. \xa0 After giving the recently passed girls at the lighthouse their dues, Nanahara leaves to search for Noriko and Kawada. He meets Izuno Inada, he can’t save her, she is delirious and is playing the game on her own private terms. Nanahara manages to flee but Inada’s paranoid schizophrenia has her now worshipping a god. \xa0 Nanahara travels through the woods and recalls all the people he has seen die. His survivor guilt takes its toll when he comes across the bodies of Keita Ijima, Yutaka and Mimura. \xadHe learns of the fight with Kiriyama, the microphones in the collars, the bomb that was made and the confidence that Yutaka gained in the end. \xa0 When Nanahara finally meets Noriko and Kawada he sees that the 3 of them are all they have to rely on. Noriko who so loves Nanahara has drawn a sketch of him in his absence. Meanwhile Izuno Inada has stripped down to her underwear and has made a sigil for her god, a deluded belief that it will protect her from all harm and bestow divination on her. Waiting for her prayers to be answered, Kazuo Kiriyama comes forth and provides a bullet to her thoughts. \xa0 35 down, 6 to go. \xa0 \xa0 Instagram –\xa0 weappreciatemanga.co.uk Twitter - @RealJamesFitton Website – Weappreciatemanga.com Email – Weappreciatemanga@gmail.com | 016: Battle Royale vol. 9 \xa0 By Koushun Takami and Masayuki Taguchi With English translation by Keith Giffen \xa0 Someone plays dead and schoolkids drop like flies. \xa0 Theme Music: \'Electro Hype\' by Liam Bradbury Podcast created by Jim Fitton and Steven Gorton. \xa0 Topics : \xa0   ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Who is Kayako?   ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Kazuo Kiriyama   ·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Narrative storytelling technique in this volume, a stream of consciousness a la James Joyce’s Ullyses. \xa0 Pop culture references:\xa0 \xa0 Superman / Krypton (Sugimura suspects that “Froggy” has body armour) \xa0 Synopsis: \xa0 The program continues when Sugimura finds the dead body of Hirono via his tracking device. He continues to look for Kayako only to encounter Yoshitori Oda, a.k.a. Frogboy. Kiriyama breaks up the two, he fires at Yoshi and scares off Sugimura. Yoshi plays dead thanks to the use of his body armour. He cries out in the hopes that Kiriyama can come close enough so that he can make a surprise attack. Kiriyama isn’t fooled. With his machine gun he evasively ducks down and disembowels Yoshi from his groin. \xa0 Having previously survived an encounter with Kazuo Kiriyama, Shuya Nanahara is guided by a vision of his recently departed friends. He shortly wakes up realising he’s been nursed by Yukio Utsumi. Utsumi has set up a group of 6 girls with plans to defeat the program. Chisato Matsui, Haruka Tanizawa, Yuka Sakaki, and Satomi Noda. They have taken fort at the island’s light house. However, one girl, Yuko Sakaki, is scared of Nanahara, she is paranoid and deluded enough to believe him to be the devil incarnate. Utsumi locks Nanahara in the bedroom with the promise that she’ll free him once he gains all of the girl’s trust. \xa0 Sakaki poisons Nanahara’s food but her go awry when the boisterous Yuka insists on serving the food and tries some for herself. Yuka dies prompting the group into a panic. Satomi takes dominance and holds every one hostage whilst demanding the killer to reveal them self.\xa0 The cook, Chisato, eventually gets a gun and holds up Satomi only for Satomi to shoot her. In defense of Chisato and the others, Utsumi retaliates and the entire gunfight ends with only one survivor, the person who incidentally started it, Sakaki. \xa0 Nanahara breaks out of the bedroom having injured his arm, believing that it is Kiriyama who is responsible for the gunfight. \xa0 Instagram –\xa0 weappreciatemanga.co.uk Twitter - @RealJamesFitton Website – Weappreciatemanga.com Email – Weappreciatemanga@gmail.com', 'chan_desc': 'It starts with a dude (James) getting his friend (Steven) interested in manga.

What’s interesting though, is that superheroes have always been popular in animation. From Western cartoons like X-Men, Justice League Unlimited, Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk, to anime titles like Science Ninja Team Gatchaman, Casshern, One-Punch Man and My Hero Academia.\xa0So how do superheroes fit into the modern animated landscape, and what actually counts as a superhero when it comes to anime? Andrew and Rob don their toughened spandex (no capes!), and head for the mean streets of animation to find out.\xa0After that it’s back to business as usual with a look at some of the things we’ve been watching, which this week are Dragon Ball Super part 6 and the anime adaptation of Koei Tecmo’s Dynasty Warriors spin-off - Samurai Warriors.If you\'ve enjoyed this podcast then please share us with your friends or leave us a rating on your podcast app of choice.

They\'ve become a staple of anime communities all over the world, but could they be better?Join Tucky (owner and organiser of conventions), and Rob (long-time critic and attendee), as they have a chat about how anime conventions could grow and evolve.Then it\'s business as usual with our regular look at some of the things we\'ve been watching, and kicking things off is the anime version of the Battle Girl High School social network game. After that it\'s time for a couple of book to manga to anime adaptations, starting with some historical fantasy in The Heroic Legend of Arslan before moving on to something more supernatural in Occult;Nine.

Rainbow Redwood is an award winning cosplayer, YouTube content creator, and seamstress. At the age of 14 she taught herself how to use a sewing machine and has never stopped learning since then. Her love for theater, dance, and historical clothing naturally lead her to perusing cosplay. At conventions when she’s not completing in craftsmanship cosplay contests she enjoys being a co-captain of Hamacon Idols*, hosting panels, teaching dance workshops (KPOP and Love Live), and judging cosplay contests. To keep up with her online you can find her here:Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/rainbowredwoodInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rainbowredwoodrose/FaceBook: https://www.facebook.com/rainbowredwood/Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/rainbowredwoodTumblr: http://rainbowredwood.tumblr.com/*Sequya is now a member of Pure☆Candy, a new idol group made of previous Hamacon Idols. You can check our their insta here: https://www.instagram.com/purecandyidols/ | OK, so what do you do when you have some of your favorite people to interview. In this case, Micah Solusod and Ayu Sakata. Only, you have interviewed them. Several times. In fact, last time they decided to interview you, instead. So now what do you do?Apparently, the answer is you play a tabletop RPG with them! So that's what we did.The name of the game is Honey Heist, made by Grant Howitt. It is a game where you are bear. You do crimes. We, as bears, did crimes. So many crimes. Micah was new to this, but you can't tell. You can find all of Grant's wonderful games at https://gshowitt.itch.io/. | Dipping once more into the wonderfully rich Hamacon 10 well, we have this lovely interview with Ask Cosplay-Senpai!Wonder whom this wonderful person is? Well, haven you ever been stuck on a costume piece? Can’t quite figure out how that prop goes together? Ask Cosplay-Senpai!With a decade of personal experience, over 25,000 items created, and hundreds of convention panels over the past decade, they are here to share their love for media, fandom, and—most of all—costuming! Find them on Instagram @askcosplaysenpai\xa0for tutorials, live builds and walkthroughs, and any advice you need on making your next cosplay the best it can possibly be.There is also this delightful interview with them.\xa0OSMnotes Find Ask Cosplay-Senpai in all these socially media-type places!

This is the holiday where we celebrate the good, hard-working folks over at NERV.\xa0 Their tireless efforts to protect us from those dastardly Angels and their constant attempts at creating the Third Impact. And who is the hardest working person there? Well, it would be none other than the wonderful, talented, and won't hurt us at all ever, Asuka Langley Soryu!What we are getting at here is that this is an interview at Hamacon\xa0 with renowned voice over artist Tiffany Grant, known best for her role as said Asuka Langley Soryu from Neon Genesis Evangelion.\xa0 | So, kids. When two podcasts like each other very much, they have a crossover episode. And when the OSMcast! and Third Impact Anime both like the works of Masaaki Yuasa and studio Science Saru? They have an episode about the movie\xa0 The Night Is Short, Walk on Girl, adapted from the novel by Tomihiko Morimi. Protip: This crazy experiment was recorded live at Hamacon 10. This is also the first time we have tried such a thing, so the audio is a little weird here and there. But still pretty listenable!\xa0  | Continuing on our journey through all the interviews we took part of at Momocon 2019, here's the one with Keith Silverstein! Who is that you may ask? Well, he has done a lot! Many will know him as Torbjörn from Overwatch, or maybe Char Aznable from Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin. Just all sorts of things! But he will forever hold a special place in our hearts around this parts, as Johnny Boya from mother flippin' REDLINE.\xa0 | As we continue the adventures of SS Momocon 2019, here is an interview we got to take part in with Zach Callison! He is probably best known giving the voice to a wonderful kid we know as Steven Universe. It's a show we kinda like. Enjoy!\xa0 | So if you haven't noticed yet, we had a ton of interviews at this past Momocon! In this one, we chatted with Deedee Magno Hall! Not only is her name amazing, she herself was also amazing as Pearl, in a cartoon people like to call Steven Universe. As... that is the cartoon's name.She was also Princess Jasmine in Disney's Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular for many years, as well as Nessarose in Wicked! She knows how to carry a tune, is all we are saying here.\xa0 | From Momocon 2019, we got the chance to talk to Carolina Ravassa! Or as you Overwatch kids may know her as, Sombra.\xa0 | So sure. maybe some other major video games expo may be happening right now, but what about what has happened before? Like, say, Momocon a few weeks back. We were there, and played an absolute non-literal ton of indie video games. These are those stories.OSMnotesMan, that was a bunch of neat games! Mostly. But hey, if you need even MORE independent coverage of independent games, Basil has made an independent post over at itsbasiltime.com to talk about some of the games that he enjoyed that were submitted to the Momocon\xa0Indie Awards Showcase, but were not on the show floor.
