He is a sought-after speaker, strategist, and the author of many bestselling books including The Obstacle Is the Way; Ego Is the Enemy; and The Daily Stoic. His books have been translated into over 30 languages and sold over two million copies worldwide. He lives outside Austin, Texas, with his family. His latest book is called Stillness Is The Key. Notes:  Commonalities of leaders who sustain excellence =  They look at the whole picture They have the ability to zoom out They have balance  Driven, skilled at what they do, but they do not run unchecked.\xa0 This creates happiness.   Highly disciplined Temperance - Integrated into life   The word enough:  Balance - "We\'re definitely going to be forgotten."\xa0 It\'s important to have the quiet time to do the work.\xa0 And you have to love doing it.   Michael Jordan\'s hall of fame speech:  "It\'s so misguided.\xa0 The problem with proving people wrong is eventually you do it.\xa0 And it\'s never enough.\xa0 Rather, you should choose to prove your own potential right.\xa0 Did I leave it all on the page?\xa0 Did I fulfill my own standards?" I choose to prove my supporters right instead of allowing detractors to take up space in my head   The higher power was the logos - the path of the universe... The stoics acknowledged fate and fortune and the power these forces had over them.  Marcus Lattimore (RB from South Carolina and the NFL) - He said, "The career ending injury I had was the best thing that ever happened to me."  Decide how you will\xa0choose\xa0to respond.\xa0 Make the choice to make a positive difference in people\'s lives.     The impact of father hood has had on Ryan:  "You realize how powerless you are as a parent.\xa0 It\'s humbling and eye opening."   The WHO - the power of relationships  It\'s a team.\xa0 It requires balance.\xa0 Both players must flourish independently:  "Accomplishments are not part of the identity of the relationship I have with Sam (his wife).\xa0 She doesn\'t give a shit how many books I sell." "I have an inner scoreboard and hold myself to those standards."     The value of a daily journal - The process, the ritual, the routine is helpful.  The act of the devotion.\xa0 Quiet time everyday, provides energy in the morning.\xa0 "A routine becomes a ritual over time." Journaling one line a day for five years: It\'s the process of warming up, talking to self, verbalizing fears   Thoughtfulness - "Interrogate yourself at the end of each day." -- This is what Churchill did Hitler said, "I recognized the correctness of my views."\xa0 That\'s not wisdom, it\'s insanity.\xa0 Don\'t do that. Privately, Abraham Lincoln with racked with doubt. The epidemic of ego easily mistakes for confidence and strength Stillness - What we\'re working towards.\xa0 We need it to think clearly.\xa0 We need to rest.  Must be fully in the moment   Momento Mori - "Get in the moment" Speaking routine - Wear the same clothes, workout before, listen to the same music, manage energy, funnel focus, and know that the material helps people Use the "Get To Know You Document" Why joining The Learning Leader Circle is a good idea  \xa0 | The Learning Leader Show With Ryan Hawk #330: Deconstructing The Art & Science Of Interviewing With Jay Acunzo Full show notes can be found at www.LearningLeader.com This is a special bonus episode focusing on deconstructing the art and science of interviewing.\xa0 You will hear learning happening in real time.\xa0 Jay Acunzo and I go a meta-level to better understand how to better improve our conversation ability, how to be better in an interview.\xa0 "Interviewing is a skill that enhances your life in a pleasant and unexpected way."\xa0 This is focused on how you can ask better questions, be more interesting and more interested, and become a better conversationalist. Notes:\xa0  The meta level of deconstructing the process of making the work is rare... "I experience the most flow when it\'s quiet, nitty-gritty work.\xa0 Those minute are profoundly rewarding for me." What makes a great interview? An open loop -- Start telling the story, but wait to close the loop until later to build intrigue... The difference between a narrative style show and an interview getting to know someone:  A story is three parts - The intent of the story: The "Joseph Campbell Heroes Journey" 1) Status Quo 2) Conflict 3) Resolution Bucket of questions:  "Tell me about X..." "How did it make you feel?" The analysis and the reflection     Change your mindset: "You\'re not an interviewer, you\'re a dance partner."  "The only thing that matters is that you lead.\xa0 Everything else is little subtle moves to get people to go to where you want to go."   "It\'s not a constant march forward. Instead, think of it like a dance. There are some steps back, steps forward, steps to the side — all packaged together in one coherent experience, with lots of zig-zagging and subtle steps inside those boundaries." Open ended questions: “Tell me about X” gets you story details, while “how did it feel when” gets you key moments of reflection and analysis. Both are crucial. Clip #1 -- JJ Redick\xa0  He says “great question” — what would make someone interviewed as often as a pro athlete say that? How to prep for an interview for someone who is interviewed all the time?  Built a basic rapport leading up to the interview -- Discussed sports, restaurants, podcasting, interviewing.\xa0 Developed a "friend" level of communication  Create an environment where the guest wants it to be a great show     Good follow up questions: Ask for an example... Asking, "How did that make you feel?" "What\'s your process?" --> Then be a deep, thoughtful listener to ask a follow up. Stay on the same level with your dance partner - Don\'t be a guest "worshiper" When following up, there are a few things you can do: 1) Distill 2) Disagree 3) Ask the next question... During an interview, the best question you can ask: "How did that make you feel?" It enables them to get in an emotional lane (away from canned responses) Testing the levels on the microphone -- Don\'t waste that opportunity.\xa0 Engineer the guest, the human -- You need them to feel like we\'re hanging out and excited about the interview.\xa0 Make it fun.\xa0 What to ask instead: "I\'m going to check your levels, do you have any pets at home?" "What would be your last meal on earth?" -- It helps people break out of their corporate drone mode.\xa0 The question is about the person, on a human plane. Create a safe space for them to share their truth. "I\'m not a journalist, I\'m a conversationalist."   Clip #2 -- Adam Savage  How did he get on the show? Working with a PR firm to book a guest -- A great PR person like Brent Underwood only recommends guests that are a good fit for the show. Ask questions that you are genuinely curious about -- I am curious about someone\'s process and it\'s always led me to a useful follow up... The issue is sometimes a "process" oriented question is the guest can answer with a generality... How to wiggle out of that?  Look at the acknowledgement section of their book to get ideas for important people/events in their life to ask about...   Mental Heuristics: Tell me about, 30,000 feet, go to a specific example... The third question is "Putting them in a box:" -- "   From Jay: Heuristics to tell great AUDIO stories:  Tell me about... How did you feel when (or, how did that feel?) Can you give me an example? (Superlatives) Best, worst, funniest, scariest, hardest, least certain, favorite, etc... (Dig for emotional moments)   Clip #3 -- Brian Koppelman  How to handle nerves -- Work to get settled in.\xa0 Get through the initial conversation point... Give people a genuine compliment for why you like their work -- Tell people why their work helps you   Hidden Gems:  Interplay between your intent for the work and your framework for it:  "My goal is to engineer an outcome, but I have an intent I don\'t want to become The Bachelor in Paradise."  Have self and situational awareness.\xa0 We carry with us good intent to serve the audience.\xa0 Don\'t let the framework or engineering supersede the original intent.     The two types of interviews: 1) The person, their story... 2) Their content  The best conversations are able to weave both together and smoothly bounce back and forth Learn about the person AND learn about the topic that he has mastered -- Master that dance between both -- I need to give you something that is going to make you better.

Kindra is one of the most sought after keynote speakers trusted by global brands to deliver presentations that inspire teams and individuals to better communicate the value of their company, their products and their individuality through strategic storytelling.\xa0 Kindra is a former Director of Marketing and VP of Sales. Her much anticipated book, Stories That Stick, will be published on September 24, 2019. Notes:  Why is storytelling so important?  It\'s how we learn, how we connect Your team needs to know you, and like you (stories do that when you tell them well) You can learn breadth/depth of a person through a story   A story is NOT:  A bullet point resume A list of information Stating the mission statement The objective   A story = The small moments when mission is in a specific place and time... When something happens. The four components of a story:  Place and time: "a moment" Identifiable characters - must see people Authentic emotion - Relatable to audience Specific details - Draw audience in to the co-creative process   Opening story of her book: In Slovenia at Thanksgiving:  The power of the sales clerk\'s ability to tell a story compelled Kindra and her husband to buy   Why did the story work?  It drew you in with powerful moments and emotion It had suspense - "I want to know what\'s going to happen..." People will give you their attention when you\'re telling a compelling story It brought them to places through vivid descriptions   How to better start a meet at work:  First, realize it\'s a skill you can develop Take a step back, think of the higher level message -- "What\'s the overall theme?"  "When have I seen this in action?"\xa0 Why was it compelling?     Make a list of nouns: People in life you\'ve had to communicate with (bosses, friends, colleagues)  Find moments and stories from those people... Understand the characters of the story   Think: "What do I want my audience to think, feel, know, and do at the end of this story?" Use the "bystander story" - Stories of others that you make yours  Remember the goal is to create connection This becomes your story... Through your eyes   How to handle price conversations?  Move from dollars and cents to value -- "They need to feel the pain of if they didn\'t have this thing I\'m selling."

"People are weary.\xa0 Trust is critical.\xa0 You must do what you say you are going to do."   "Trust is not being gullible.\xa0 Trust is a hard edged concept." It\'s three parts:  Character Competence Authority   How to build a culture of trust?  Listen -- Capture what your team is saying through 1 on 1 conversations.\xa0 Understand common values, goals, strategies Reframe the dashboard -- What does winning look like? Make sure it is clearly defined.\xa0 What\'s the current level of trust in the organization?   How to run an effective meeting:  Have a purpose, the right people in the room, and follow up assignments. Have pre-work.\xa0 It must be done.\xa0 Go through each individual member.\xa0 "Build trust by the process."   How to run a town-hall:  Listen carefully, repeat it.\xa0 FOLLOW UP and take action.   How to handle broken trust?  Fix breaches immediately. "Bad news doesn\'t get better with age." -- "Don\'t let grass grown under your feet."   "Trust decreases transaction costs." -- Everything is faster when there is trust. "You can\'t do good business with bad people." Interview process:  Understand the decision points Determine roles/responsibilities as a team Check references The most important decisions you will make is who you hire and who you fire   There must be a vividly clear picture of what success is:  Break down the details: Who is the champion? Time frame? Budget? -- Measure all of them to ensure all involved know what success is. Do a post-mortem: What went well? What didn\'t? Why?   Keep your team informed:  "Err on the side of over-communication." "Write a partner letter every two weeks.\xa0 Keep everyone updated." For JetBlue, there is a weekly meeting update -- a "State of the Union" for the 24,000 employees   Create a learning organization -- Foster an environment where there is a love for learning. Strive for win-win negotiations  Each is part of a series -- Think long term You must be fair in order to do many deals Art of the compromise -- Don\'t be zero sum.\xa0 You\'ll build a reputation and nobody will want to work with you.   Embrace respectful conflict -- Create an environment where people can open disagree.\xa0 This helps people refine their ideas and make them better.

(Of A Revolution).\xa0 He also is their primary songwriter and has been described by his band-mates as, "Our Leader." He formed the band with his best friend (and drummer) Chris Culos for an 8th grade talent show 23 years ago in Rockville, Maryland.\xa0 I first saw him play at a college bar called "First Run" on the Miami University campus in Oxford, OH my freshman year (2000).\xa0 Since then, O.A.R. has gone on to sell out Madison Square Garden.\xa0 We recorded this episode in Austin, Texas next to the stage at Stubb\'s Waller Creek Amphitheater. Notes:  The importance of persistence and why Our 20-year history – Watch them playing at First Run in Oxford, OH – The journey from small college bars to selling out Madison Square Garden Chose Ohio State because they have the most bars in a small area – Earned the Buckeye National Scholarship “Money was not part of the equation at the beginning.\xa0 We just needed enough to keep the van gassed up.” The primary reason why you’re so happy it goes well is so you get to keep doing it. Two initial goals: Finish college and build the band. – The band started in 8th\xa0grade for a talent show. “We wanted to get on the road, scrape our knee, and build to sustain. It was never about money; it was about gaining ground.\xa0 Moving forward, progressing.” The first word to describe Marc from other members of the band: “Leader.” – What it means to be a leader of creative people… The stages of Marc’s leadership: 1st\xa0Stage: Driven completely by the vision of wanting to make music out wandering the world.\xa0 “I wanted to make these songs because they made me feel good.\xa0 I wanted to be out with my friends and empower each other.” 2nd\xa0Stage: “It becomes our vision.” – “You may no longer provide the best leadership, so you need to empower people in your camp to lead.\xa0 In order to be in the drier seat, you have to know what other people’s superpowers are so each one can flourish.\xa0 3rd\xa0Stage: Chris (the drummer) – He nudged the group forward to a rebirth.\xa0 Became motivated to get back in the driver seat and now he had amazing co-pilots who had their own creative genius.\xa0 “Realize the powers of those around you and harness that. That was the afterburners for us.\xa0 It’s built out of mutual respect and admiration for each other.”\xa0 “Being a leader has to show that things aren’t always going to go great.\xa0 You must maintain, be composed, don’t flail your arms around.\xa0 Move forward.” Respectful disagreement:\xa0 How to decide which song to open with at Madison Square Garden… How to make decisions through disagreement?\xa0 “I know when I’m wrong, I know when I’m right too.\xa0 Good ideas… It’s a self-filtering system.\xa0 You have to listen, be open to others.\xa0 In that moment, it was perfect.” “A part of leadership is knowing when you’re wrong and when the other idea is better and move on.” “When one of your heroes is standing next to you and says, “I really like this,” that impacts you.\xa0 “I was wrong and wasn’t thinking of the big picture. It was selfish.” How to handle people who don’t like your work? Story: Opening for Dave Matthews Band at The Gorge – The entire front row turned their back in protest of the opening act.\xa0 “I get angry.\xa0 My new goal was to get them to turn around.\xa0 It’s a lesson: You can either get hurt or say, “I get to play my songs at the Gorge.\xa0 Eventually they will respect us.” Giving a TED Talk: Authenticity – Being real, true to yourself.\xa0 “Everything I’ve created has stemmed from a few nostalgic pin-pointed childhood memories. I’ve tried to build my whole life to tell those stories of what we can do when we’re together.”\xa0 Fans for Life: “We were living a life we’ve dreamt of.” The resistance of chasing approval of others – “That theme is rooted in unabashedly telling a story about where you come from.\xa0 Sticking to the same morals we were instilled with since growing up.”\xa0 “I’m not seeking approval because we aren’t adjusting music to fit in, we play what makes us feel good.” Chasing your curiosity and obsessions with great rigor – How to create a life to do that?\xa0 “My dream is we’ve built something that allows us something time to create.\xa0 Keep working on live shows to continue to play them.\xa0 We love them.\xa0 If you don’t play 5 nights a week, it won’t be there for you.\xa0 You have to get the reps. Sustained excellence:\xa0 Commonalities: 1) Drive 2) Social – Able to work a room, communicate well with others. 3) Willingness to fail – “If you aren’t willing to jump off that edge, you don’t deserve to get it.” Song writing process: “Each song has a different method for me.” “There are moments when I’m walking down the street in NYC and it comes to me.\xa0 I’ll run to the studio and quickly record it.\xa0 There are so many different styles, but it all has to come from being inspired.” The creative process:\xa0 Working with Greg Wattenberg to be a sounding board and offer honest feedback.\xa0 “We’ve never changed what we’re doing.\xa0 We’ve only built upon it and have always focused on our story.” “People get so confused, they want everything, they want a boat, a house, so much.\xa0 We just want to keep going.” Celebrating the 25th anniversary of the band.\xa0 “We want to celebrate the fact of a few buddies being together for that time.” “Tell your story.\xa0 Don’t be afraid to tell your story.” How to not get complacent and conservative after success?\xa0 For fear of failure?\xa0 “We take risks every year.\xa0 We book a year in advance and we book some locations that we know might not work.\xa0 We maintain pressure at all times.” “You have to take calculated risks and create things that may make you a little uncomfortable at first... To move the art form forward.” Gratitude – The importance of John Lampley being added to the band.\xa0 “John Lampley is magic.\xa0 He brought joy in the room.\xa0 His life gratitude, how he looks at opportunity of everything: meals, being alive, we just exercised in the truck and he keeps talking about how good he feels.”\xa0 It’s about being grateful for what you have and what you get to do on a daily basis. Practicing all day long – Love the craft.\xa0 Loving the process of working on it.\xa0 “This is what we do, this is how we operate.”\xa0 The mindset of daily improvement. “We feel very lucky to be doing this.\xa0 You better earn it and keep it.” Don’t pay attention to what others are doing, Focus on improving your craft. “What they really like about your group is how it makes them feel? General life advice: 46:45 – 47:27 (HERO) “Find something that you truly feel connected to… there’s energy in this world that will tell you when you’re in the right spot. And then work. A lot of people want to be famous, how you going to get there. And then grind.”\xa0 Bring joy to yourself and others is life. “Be willing to play anywhere.\xa0 Just keep going.” – It’s all about getting the reps. “What you love, go love it.\xa0 You might be broke for a while, but you’ll be fulfilled.\xa0 It will fill you up.” “Everyone carries around a bucket.\xa0 You can fill it up or empty it.” “Find what you love and chase it down.” Preshow ritual: “What is going through your mind the 90 seconds before you go on stage?” – “We have a group huddle.” – “Remember when we were in the basement and we said, one day we’re going to do this.\xa0 Remember how happy we were.\xa0 We’re here.\xa0 Go be a Rockstar.” The feedback received from fans/listeners – That’s the juice that fuels you.

Tired of living a life that felt prescribed to him by society, Jason used his out-of-the-box thinking and ingenuity to create multiple profitable Internet-based businesses.\xa0 His most-notable business was IWearYourShirt, a company that generated over $1,000,000 by wearing sponsored t-shirts to promote over 1,600 businesses on social media from 2008-2013 before "influencer" was a mainstream term. If that wasn\'t weird enough, from 2012 and 2013, Jason auctioned off his last name to the highest bidders and made nearly $100,000 doing it. Jason\'s second book is titled "Own Your Weird." Jason has been featured by The Today Show, CBS Evening News, USA Today, and The New York Times. Notes:\xa0  The importance of reviewing previous work... And why it should embarrass you.\xa0 That is growth.  "Don\'t compare your starting line to someone else\'s finish line."\xa0 We all started somewhere.\xa0 It is a progression. It\'s important to understand context.   Leaders who sustain excellence =  They test all of their assumptions on a regular basis  They don\'t accept things as they are... Always trying something new   They are extremely curious Have an experimenters mindset They are validated internally -- They don\'t seek the validation externally.\xa0 They are fulfilled from the inside.   How to create a mindset to not worry about hitting a best-seller list?  Set a low goal (getting the book published) and a high goal (selling 10K copies).\xa0 Understand that there is so much out of your control and celebrate hitting the goals that are within your control (writing and publishing the book).\xa0 You can\'t control how many people choose to buy it. The emails received from fans/listeners are the fuel that keeps you going.\xa0 The feedback from people you\'re positively impacting.   Properly define success for yourself:  You spend a third of your life working.\xa0 Make it count. Figure out a way to be see as excellent, out of the box thinker   Have a mindset of, "How can I make this better?" Present your plan to your boss/leaders in the company: "Here\'s my plan, here is how we will do it..."  Be proactive.\xa0 Make your boss\'s life easier.\xa0 Help them succeed.   Rejection:\xa0 "When someone says no to you, it doesn\'t mean you\'re a bad person.\xa0 It\'s not a reflection of who you are as a person."  Understand that "No" means "not yet" most of the time.   "Choose Adventure"  Not wanting to live the same life that others have lived Example: Moving to a sweet house in Southern California with another couple   Challenge assumptions:  You don\'t have to do it the way it\'s always been done Experiment -- Test --> Reflect, analyze.\xa0 Understand what worked, what didn\'t, and why?   Working to live, not living to work  How do you schedule your days?  Start with living   Define what really fills you up --> Prioritize that first.\xa0 Put it on your calendar first.   Every six months, sit down and prioritize what\'s important to you.  Constraints can be a powerful force.\xa0 Parkinson\'s Law.   Set your "enough goals."\xa0 -->\xa0 "Getting to this number will be enough."  "There\'s always more.\xa0 What about enough?" "We don\'t need to grow our business for growth\'s sake." "$33,000/month is our enough goal." -- "It\'s clearly defined.\xa0 It\'s right for us."   The process of writing a book live -- Jason learned a lot about himself writing while others were watching. The end of the podcast club:\xa0 Email us (Ryan@LearningLeader.com) -- When was the last time you truly showed up as yourself?  | The Learning Leader Show With Ryan Hawk #325: Ron Ullery Full show notes at www.LearningLeader.com Be part of "Mindful Monday" - Text LEARNERS to 44222 Coach Ron Ullery began his football coaching career at Centerville High School in 1977.\xa0 He was the Offensive Coordinator (and play-caller) for my four years as the quarterback for Centerville (1996,1997,1998,1999).\xa0 He was promoted to Head Coach in 2000.\xa0 In his 14 years as head coach, he compiled a 107-45 record. Eight of his teams advanced to the Division 1 (big school) postseason.\xa0 He is currently the Offensive Line coach at Springboro High School.\xa0 This episode was recorded in front of the Springboro football team, coaches, and administrative staff.\xa0 He\'s coached high school football for 43 years. Notes:  Leaders who sustain excellence =  Understanding how hard it is to be excellent Knowing there are multiple ways to lead (militaristic, fear driven, soft spoken, calm) Must be organized -- Have to set a plan to direct people.\xa0 How are we going to get where we want to go? Must have a tremendous work ethic -- Ask the people you\'re leading to work extremely hard and you must be willing to work even harder Have extremely high expectations, unwilling to ever waiver -- They don\'t lower expectations to feel good Must have humility -- Can\'t be all about you   A great coach can make a player feel invincible:  A great coach sees another level in you.\xa0 A level above where you think you can go.\xa0 And they push you to go there... Doing things you never dreamed you could possibly do makes you think it\'s possible. "We are in a era where mediocrity and average is okay."  "If you want to, you can lay in bed all day, have your iPad here, your TV with 250 stations, your phone, you can doordash leave your door unlocked...\xa0 you never have to do anything."   We need to strive to be elite and excellent   Being grateful for the hard work -- What it leads to... X & O\'s are not the most important part of football:  "Young people will live up to your expectations or down to your expectations almost all the time." "It\'s our job to place the level of those expectations." The elite performers hit the level of expectations set and then keep going.   The confidence a coach gives his/her players by exhibiting an incredible work ethic:  "It has everything to do with making sure I\'m prepared.\xa0 I want to control what I can control.\xa0 I don\'t want to be the weak link." "To prepare, I need to be in a quiet place.\xa0 I became a morning guy in college.\xa0 I was majoring in Math.\xa0 It was tough."   Delayed gratification -- Voluntary hardship:  The ability to delay gratification is a super power "Instant gratification is what everyone wants now." -- Foresight: People have less foresight now than they used to.\xa0 They have instant access to everything they want at all times   "If you are unsuccessful, look in the mirror.\xa0 The competition is not real stiff.\xa0 If you have some foresight and a strong work ethic, you can do whatever you want. Most people don\'t have that foresight." The difference between winning teams and losing teams  Winning teams: The players were empowered, had ownership. and they (the players) held each other accountable. "You can coach them as hard as you want and they will respond as long as they know you care about them."  "It\'s a lot harder when you care."     Why stay as a high school coach?  "I love the high school atmosphere.\xa0 I love the age, I love everything about high school. I love the challenge.\xa0 You take whatever comes in the doors.\xa0 There\'s no recruiting.\xa0 You do the best you can with what you\'re given.\xa0 I love everything about these guys." "In my 43 years of coaching, I\'ve never felt like I\'ve had a job."   Why offensive line?  "It was the biggest learning off-season of my career." "Offensive linemen is by far the hardest position to succeed at.\xa0 It\'s also the most impactful of winning games." "They are the least athletic players on the field by far.\xa0 They do the most important job, yet they are the least athletic." "It\'s a tremendous challenge.\xa0 And I love challenges.\xa0 I love seeing them succeed."   How to earn respect:  Must exhibit leadership, mental toughness, and discipline -- "You can\'t ask anything of anyone else if you\'re not willing and already doing it yourself." You have to care and it has to show how much you care about people.\xa0 You have to do more than other people.   Advice to his son Brent Ullery (head coach of Centerville High School):  "You have to formulate things you believe in.\xa0 You have to have strong beliefs.\xa0 Formulate your beliefs not based on what you did when you played, but base them on what you\'ve learned from all of your experiences.\xa0 Don\'t let the outside noise influence you."   Framework for continuous improvement and ability adapt:  "Listen and learn.\xa0 I\'m a better learner today than any year of my life.\xa0 When I started out coaching I thought I knew everything.\xa0 Then I realized I knew nothing." Learning talks with Coach Gregg every morning -- "I would meet him every morning and we would talk about everything.\xa0 Some about football, but more about people.\xa0 He was a master about human nature and motivating young people." The main idea with continual learning is "you\'ve never arrived." "You\'ve never arrived, you\'re always becoming."   How to effectively lead peers/friends:  As a leader, it becomes your responsibility to lift others up and expect more of them -- Sometimes when you have to make difficult choices to prioritize leadership over friendship The moment that Kirk Herbstreit became a leader (he was a quarterback at Centerville High School)   It\'s much easier to follow.\xa0 But far less fulfilling.\xa0 You have to make the choice to lead daily. The sacrifices made to be accountable to teammates -- Doing everything within your power to maximize your ability Laying the foundation for future generations Having the willingness to go get what you want -- Don\'t let anything get in your way Use the "Get To Know You Document" Why joining The Learning Leader Circle is a good idea  | The Learning Leader Show With Ryan Hawk Full Show Notes can be found at www.LearningLeader.com #324: Charles Fishman Charles Fishman is the acclaimed author of\xa0One Giant Leap,\xa0A Curious Mind\xa0(with Brian Grazer),\xa0The Wal-Mart Effect, and\xa0The Big Thirst.

"The work needs to be as good as it can be." Getting to the moon was the largest project in the history of civilization Clarity of the mission - Everyone must know the goal Must keep people motivated Standards must be clear - And the reasoning behind each action (intentional)   President Kennedy was frustrated with how the U.S. was doing versus the Russians in space.\xa0 He needed to make a bold statement.\xa0 When it was made, the administration felt there was a 50/50 shot that it could happen.  It was important to announce broad goal and the reason behind it   "Take the stairs" - Think of it as a blessing. "I\xa0get\xa0to do this."  Not because it is easy, but because it is hard. "A master stroke of leadership because it was a stretch goal, but it wasn\'t insanity."\xa0 It must be balanced.   There are tapes of JFK talking scientific discovery where it was obvious he had little understanding of it.\xa0 -->\xa0 It\'s important to have people you have confidence in leading areas where you\'re lacking knowledge.  "If JFK wasn\'t assassinated, we may not have gone to the moon.\xa0 He was starting to get cold feet about the cost."   The space program created a culture of learning from failure:  "Every single failure had to be investigated, understood, and resolved." "No Random Failures" was the motto. "Every failure is a gift." -- There were 14,000 recorded failures in testing.   Collaboration -- How to keep so many people aligned?\xa0 There were 400,000 people from 20,000 companies working on the Apollo missions!  NASA\'s management style:  Clearly defined roles - What are your solutions to the problems? Gave assignments and qualities that needed to be met     NASA had a culture where they brought everyone together for in person meetings.\xa0 "Every minute of a mission would be walked through."  There was transparency and decisions got made. Get people together in person and do something important.\xa0 This built camaraderie among the dispirit teams.   Bill Tindall -- A mission planning genius on space navigation.\xa0 He was also gracious, self-effacing, and had a great sense of humor.  Bill respected what others had done, had respect for the mission.\xa0 He had the confidence to be calm.\xa0 A different person who used a different manner would have been a disaster working with the leaders at MIT. People have to be persuaded to follow you.   Both Gene Kranz and Bill Tindall were unafraid to hear input.\xa0 They were confident enough to find the right answer (wherever it came from).

He is currently writing a new book on “productive disagreement”, which will be published in 2020. Ian also created, wrote and performed in the BBC radio comedy Before They Were Famous. Notes:\xa0  Leaders who sustain excellence =  Have the ability to think about their own thinking -- Step outside and reflect Know that you\'ll say "I don\'t know" frequently Breadth -- A range of interests Interested in building knowledge and an awareness that it might not pay off (and being ok with that)   Ian built his life around curiosity -- He was a strategist for ad agencies.\xa0 He needed to deeply understand his clients.\xa0 That is a job built on curiosity.  "I am a curiosity driven writer."   Children are born curious... "People are born with habits/knowledge to survive."\xa0 And then they stop.\xa0 There\'s no evolutionary impulse to keep going.  It becomes a conscious choice to cognitive resources and time   The two types of curiosity  Diversive: Hunger for new information.\xa0 It comes from an information gap.\xa0 Agatha Christie understands how to create an information gap to keep you turning the page Epistemic: Desire to acquire knowledge/build/assimilate into networks in your brain.\xa0 It requires discipline.\xa0 It\'s engendered.\xa0 It\'s diversive curiosity grown up.   "There is a rising premium on people with a high need for cognition."\xa0 NFC (need for cognition) is a scientific measure of intellectual curiosity "Taking action.\xa0 Doing... is a form of learning.\xa0 They are intertwined." Reflecting on own habits -- use self as a lab experiment... Then talk with others. Empathically curious -- Being curious about what\'s inside of other person\'s head.\xa0 How they think and feel. "You\'re going to be come a better communicator being a better listener." Atul Gawande -- Ask the unscripted question.\xa0 Make a human connection. Have 10% of your brain switched on to "Am I talking too much?" How to have productive disagreements:  Don\'t avoid it Have disagreements we both can live with "You\'ll have more productive disagreement if you\'re curious about the other person."   People who have a higher level of scientific curiosity... They don\'t rush to judgement.\xa0 Think, "Oh, I wonder why I think that?" "Nobody has trained us in how to disagree with each other." "You have this choice in judgement and curiosity." Life/Career advice: "Be interested in everything.\xa0 Go deep in one area."  Have core people in your life and foster the weak ties.   Everyone is born curious. But only some retain the habits of exploring, learning and discovering as they grow older.

From ministry to working for a nonprofit nearly seven years, to his own journey as a writer and teacher of online courses – Jeff takes us down the path of his leadership journey and what led him to that success. Jeff shared “I had never really thought of myself as a leader, I had kind of found my way into leadership positions.” Listening to a majority of peoples stories it seems to be true that those in leadership weren’t always looking to be in that role but naturally fell into it because they naturally have the gift that people inspire to become or follow.  Jeff shares with us during this interview the importance of taking ownership. You may be asking yourself why does ownership matter as a leader? Ownership is the sense of creating the feeling of responsibility not just for yourself, but your team as a whole. He also went on to share that people are hesitant to take the first step because it could lead to failure or rejection, however, Jeff feels your biggest enemy is anonymity. There is so much comparison in the world today that people are terrified to be the leader and take ownership for who they want to become and successfully lead that out. The takeaway from today is take that leap of faith, believe in yourself and build your confidence to know that you can accomplish your goals and dreams! *** This episode is brought to you by the John Maxwell Team.

Quint Studer, creator of Vibrant Community Partners – a coach advisory firm that helps communities on the path to vibrancy and creates a plan to help them grow in to the best version of themselves, sat down with us to discuss 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦. Not only is he the creator, but he is also a businessman, entrepreneur, and mentor to many similar to a lot of our team members!  Quint didn’t start out as a leader and entrepreneur, instead, he was a special education teacher and taught in High School grade level. So how did he go from a teacher to a leader? Quint ended up working in a Behavior Medical Center which led him into the healthcare field and eventually becoming the President of a hospital where he later formed a Healthcare Consulting Team. Ironically, at the same time John Maxwell released his first book is when Quint really took a dive into bettering his leadership journey and gathering insight from his mentors and teachers to help guide him to be better. The journey Quint describes is so relatable to many of our stories, one day you are this and the next you’re on top of the leader board helping guide others to a better path. As he said “I was a guy who had a degree in Education and a Master’s in Special Education. Next thing I know, I’m a Manager in the hospital.”  The truth is your journey and path of life can lead you anywhere, it’s the experiences you gain along the way and the people you meet that help build and mold who you become. Maybe you’re an accountant and you really want to become a public speaker, perhaps you are a restaurant manager and you want to become a professional coach…the lesson here is you can do anything you put your heart and mind to.

On this week’s episode, we interviewed Sam Horn the Intrigued Expert: a world-renowned Author, Keynote Speaker, communications strategist, and executive coach. Sam was so excited to share with you all her journey, and we were just as excited to have her as our guest! Growing up Sam took on the hobby of riding horses and the challenges that came with learning how to be a successful rider. She noted “as a result of growing up, I think that’s when I became an entrepreneur, the idea of heading out and seeing life as adventurous instead of dangerous.” For some people, it just becomes second-nature and you grow up knowing you want to help guide others.  Deeper into our interview with Sam we dove into her thinking of mindset and how growing up they never teach you how to have a great “60-second opening” so that people are intrigued and want to hold a conversation with you. Think about it, you probably talk to an average of five strangers a day and if we all knew how to communicate effectively it would be a beautiful thing. Sam shared with us her thinking behind the 60-seconds and how important that really is. Come listen along with us as we share a special episode with one of our Top 10 nominees for the John C.

Serhant shares great insight from his book about how to sell more real estate. Learn his techniques for better understanding clients, reviving dead deals, and constantly generating new business.\xa0 \xa0 Episode Highlights:\xa0 \xa0  Dead deals were a big part of the reason Serhant wrote his book. He wanted to figure out what action plan he could put into effect to understand clients' feelings. If you can anticipate a client’s feelings, you know how to take them to the next step. Working with clients is a process of elimination, not a shopping spree. When you take the initiative to be proactive about the homebuying process, you set the expectations for the process. This will help you to close. People hate being sold, but they love shopping with friends. Find something in common with everyone you meet because that's where friendship starts. Clients buy-in on your confidence. He maintains confidence by knowing he’s going to do everything he possibly can to help his client buy a home. Ryan tells multiple stories about prospects he stayed in touch with for years before doing a deal.\xa0 The tv show is not a huge lead source for Ryan. It does give him exposure and gets his name out there. Ryan describes his follow-up, follow-through, follow-back process. Being organized, especially with email, helps his team stay diligent with follow-up. He starts his day, the night before with a thirty-minute evaluation and planning session. Making plans is not complicated. Use a calendar. Serhant tells the story of how his career began in 2008.\xa0 At the start of his career, Serhant looked for people who were doing the best job and copied them. Serhant shares his Finder, Keeper, Doer strategy for time management. Lead generation is his main priority every day. Don’t create excuses. Create solutions. Serhant’s book describes how you can set up your day to maximize success. Generating leads is not taking away someone’s money.\xa0 Serhant describes how he balances his business with having a young baby. Deals die all the time because of poor and dishonest communication. Tell a story around the property. Look for the story that can be told. Real estate agents don’t ask enough questions. Every day is a new day and anything could happen. Serhant’s online course covers all the minutiae of being a realtor. It covers everything he does to sell real estate in New York City.\xa0  \xa0 3 Key Points:   If you can anticipate what the client is going to feel, you can set expectations and close your deals. Follow-up, follow-through, and follow-back. Be deliberate about how you schedule each day.\xa0  \xa0 Resources Mentioned:  LCA Marketing Center: LCAmarketingcenter.com Lab Coat Agents: LabCoatAgents.com Ryan Serhant YouTube, vlog, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter  Million Dollar Listing New York  Sell It Like Serhant (book) Sell It Like Serhant (the course) Wunderlist (app)  HyperFast Agent Live  \xa0 Connect with Lab Coat Agents: Lab Coat Agents on Facebook Lab Coat Agents on Twitter Lab Coat Agents on Instagram Lab Coat Agents Facebook Group | During this episode of the Lab Coat Agents Podcast, host Jeff Pfitzer speaks with Erin Bradley, author of Pursuing Freedom. Bradley’s rags-to-riches story provides many strategies for those who like to serve and build referrals. Learn her techniques for building a deep referral network that will make you unforgettable.\xa0 \xa0 Episode Highlights:\xa0 \xa0  Bradley was frustrated and deeply in debt when she had the idea to build a referral directory of trusted local service providers. Even when her business was at rock bottom, she found a way to pay for a coach. There’s nothing more valuable than coaching and accountability. Bradley first invested in coaching to conquer her fear of sales and to help scale her business. She needed coaching again to help her transition into her current training and coaching role. Providing a comprehensive resource list to your clients can keep you top of mind. Always leave every phone call and meeting with an action item. People want to talk about themselves. Approach conversations with curiosity so you can identify where to serve. Find the action item and follow up.\xa0 Call your database and start filling up your resource list. Vet the people on your list as you build your tribe. You’re creating a living document. Any time you feel a lull in your business, you can recreate this process. Market your yellow pages. Tag vendors when you go out with them or work with them. The biggest roadblock for someone not meeting their volume goals is simply activity. The more they see you, the more they’re going to remember you. People need to know that business will have its ups and downs. Lenders should also be consistent with past client followup. People falsely believe that everyone else is implementing strategies like this. They're not. What is the depth of your relationship with the people who are making it on to your list? Teach others to build their business by referral. You’re missing the boat if you’re simply handing out a list. Be a resource to everyone you meet.  \xa0 3 Key Points:   Build your referral network by providing value to the people on your vendor list. Consider the depth of your relationship with the people making it on to your vendor list. Teach others how to build their business by referral.\xa0  \xa0 Resources Mentioned:  LCA Marketing Center: LCAmarketingcenter.com Lab Coat Agents: LabCoatAgents.com Erin Bradley on Facebook  Pursuing Freedom (book)  Pursuing Freedom Podcast Pursuing Freedom Episode 56 Pursuing Freedom website, Instagram  The Go Giver (book)  The Seven Levels of Communication (book) Build Your Tribe printable list  \xa0 Connect with Lab Coat Agents: Lab Coat Agents on Facebook Lab Coat Agents on Twitter Lab Coat Agents on Instagram Lab Coat Agents Facebook Group | During this episode of the Lab Coat Agents Podcast, host Jeff Pfitzer talks to Nikki Klein, a realtor with a thriving business in Boca Raton, Florida, who has grown large local Facebook groups simply by coming from a place of contribution. Learn her strategies on how to use Facebook groups for prospecting and more. \xa0 Episode Highlights:\xa0  Klein entered the real estate industry five years ago when she moved to Boca Raton, Florida. Klein describes how she is constantly building and rebuilding her team. Hiring the right agents for the wrong business can cause your team to implode. As a leader, be sure you can model the systems you want your team to implement.\xa0 Klein’s prospecting involves digging into her database and holding events. Klein describes her strategy for using Facebook. Your personal page should be 80% personal, 20% business. Even the business content you share should tell a story. Having a story behind your posts is very important. Klein was a mother to small children in a new area when she started her first Facebook group. She is very particular about the posts she allows into the group and dedicates time to moderating posts. How you set up the group is very important. Think carefully about the name of your group. Klein designed her group to capture people who are moving to the area. She reaches out personally to everyone who joins the group through direct messages. There is very little drama in her groups because she doesn’t stand for it. If you have to ask yourself if you should let a post in, don’t let it in. Hold community events for your group members to get them talking face to face. You can capture the information of every person that attends your event. Everyone wants to be a part of something bigger than themselves. Klein describes two of her favorite past community events. If you’re willing to do the work, you can make a big impact on other people’s lives. Klein’s team did not pay for any leads last year and they are not running targeted ads. When you come from a place of wanting to contribute, it will come back tenfold.\xa0 If you’re not passionate about the subject of your group, it will fail. If you want people to interact, you need a Facebook group. If you’re simply sharing information, use a page. Success in a Facebook group is when you have people interacting. Be authentic. Don’t be salesy.\xa0  \xa0 3 Key Points:   Your personal Facebook page should follow the 80/20 rule: 80% personal posts, 20% posts related to your business. Facebook groups are successful when members are interacting, sharing, and asking questions. Take your Facebook group offline and hold community events.  \xa0 Resources Mentioned:  LCA Marketing Center: LCAmarketingcenter.com Lab Coat Agents: LabCoatAgents.com Nikki Klein on Facebook, Instagram Boca Raton Moms Connect (Facebook group) Journey to Mindful Growth (Facebook group)  \xa0 Connect with Lab Coat Agents: Lab Coat Agents on Facebook Lab Coat Agents on Twitter Lab Coat Agents on Instagram Lab Coat Agents Facebook Group | On this episode of the Lab Coat Agents Podcast, host Jeff Pfitzer talks to Jennifer Ramey, a military spouse with a social media background who launched her successful real estate business in 2015. Learn what inspired her to begin building her team early and what she’s done to create a unique and engaging brand. \xa0 Episode Highlights:\xa0  Ramey is a military spouse who grew up in central Florida. When her husband retired, she pursued her real estate license. Ramey hired her first admin three months into the business and added an agent to her team six months in.\xa0 She was inspired to begin building her team when she attended a KW Family Reunion and attended a session about long-term planning. She left the event with a long-term plan for her business and she began implementing it. She knew what she needed to do and who she needed to have on her team to make it happen. What is the story behind The Giant Group? Ramey embraced her height in her unique branding. How is she using her experience as a military spouse in her business? When engaging with Facebook groups, come from a place of contribution. Provide information and support. Her team serves many military families and has carved out a niche for sight-unseen buyers.\xa0 She provides advice about making videos for long-distance buyers. You still have to build rapport with people who have never seen you. Ramey’s team incorporates fun and quirkiness into their branding.\xa0 She picked three social media platforms she wanted to crush. Pick one social media platform to master at a time, then move on to the next one. Cross-posting on social media can always lead back to your website. Post content that will engage people. She might post a listing once a week. Motivational quotes do well on Instagram. How is she utilizing Facebook tools and video marketing? Ramey describes aspects of her strategy for Facebook ads. What follow up systems or CRM is she using? The best CRM is the one you will use. You can have good ideas all day long, but you must implement them for them to count.    3 Key Points:   \xa0 Making a plan for your business will guide you as you build out your team. \xa0 Don’t be afraid to incorporate unique or quirky aspects into your branding. Pick one social media platform to master at a time.  \xa0 Resources Mentioned:  LCA Marketing Center: LCAmarketingcenter.com Lab Coat Agents: LabCoatAgents.com Jennifer Ramey on Facebook\xa0 Phone: 706-231-1556\xa0 The Giant Group website, Facebook,  YouTube  The Millionaire Real Estate Agent (book) KW Family Reunion  GoPro HERO 7 Black Command CRM Follow Up Boss CRM  \xa0 Connect with Lab Coat Agents: Lab Coat Agents on Facebook Lab Coat Agents on Twitter Lab Coat Agents on Instagram Lab Coat Agents Facebook Group | Keri Shull leads the top real estate team in Virginia and is a renowned speaker and coach.

That makes things feel chaotic and confusing for your customers, too, and it\'s hard to get traction. Alex Hughes is a Life Coach committed to helping busy mothers carve out headspace and optimize their creative soul nourishing energy, so they can live their life purpose and be the change agents the world needs. Specifically, she helps mothers unravel internalized patriarchal belief systems and bring feminism home by teaching them how to come into healthy, self-honoring relationship with their time, energy, and emotions, and to create conscious equitable partnerships at home. But when she joined the Origin Incubator a year ago, she was lacking the clarity and center that she needed to take her business and clients to the next level. Listen in to this episode to hear how she made the critical shift that allowed her to go from fuzzy to focused and get some serious traction in her business, including having made enough to cover her expenses for the remainder of the year by August. | While I love sharing ideas that are against the grain, I rarely go full-on controversial. But today, I am. To be honest, I’m squirming as I write this because my central nervous system has trouble with the inner explosion that happens when someone has been offended by something I’ve said or an idea I’ve shared. My husband, on the other hand, is built differently. With Scorpio rising, he goes right for the truth in an at-times-shocking way and is far less (and sometimes not at all) concerned about what other people think. So here’s the deal: We have an incredibly important podcast episode for you today that is going to piss off some people in our community and also has the potential to save some of their lives. If you choose to listen in, would you be willing to do the following? • Know that everything shared by our guest is grounded in evidence and if you choose to learn more, you’ll be amazed by how much data backs up these unconventional ideas. • Know that I do not believe there is one right thing for everyone (nor does our guest). So, please know that if what is shared in this episode challenges the choices you’ve made but you feel really good about those choices and they’re working for you, I celebrate that with all of my heart. • Know that if what is shared on this episode challenges some of the choices you’ve made and you are pissed off, but there’s also a part of you that knows that those choices aren’t entirely working for you, then dig into the resources shared. That’s a lot of preamble. That’s how nervous I am. This episode is about mental health and psychiatric drugs and the pharmaceutical industry in general, and there is critical information shared that you need to know as a human to have informed consent about what goes into your body. Also, the beliefs shared in this episode are not in any way the party line. It’s why our guest, the brilliant NY Times bestselling author, Dr. Kelly Brogan, has been launching her revolutionary new book, Own Your Self, in a grassroots way. Her ideas are so groundbreaking (and controversial) that she knew she wouldn’t be waltzing onto The Dr. Oz Show or any other major media (because hi, hello, they’re funded by pharmaceutical advertising dollars). Here’s what you’ll learn in this episode: • The truth about chemical imbalances and the shocking discovery made from 6 decades of research • Why the information you get on Google is completely biased and how to find the truth • How to send your body signals of safety to turn on your own healing mechanisms Know this: We are at a critical time in history where we are being called upon to be far more conscious consumers and realize the source and motives of the media we take in. I’m incredibly grateful for the privilege to have a platform to share messages like the one today that may not always be the most popular but are so necessary. After you’ve listened in, I want to hear from you: What did this episode bring up for you? What did you learn? Did it cause you to question anything that you’ve held as truth so far?

It turned out, she needed something far more powerful that she never would have never sought out but she\'s so grateful she found. Listen in to hear how this videographer, editor, and online business owner cleared her blind spots, pivoted her business, discovered her worthiness, and identified her mission and what makes her unique in 2019 so that she could build an unshakeable business foundation for strong growth. | Years ago I sat in a beautiful theater in Downtown Salt Lake City and was swept away by the stories the energetic woman was telling from stage. I walked out of the session and immediately texted the conference organizer, letting her know that this woman needed to be keynoting on the mainstage next time. Little did I know, when I had the honor of getting all fired up by her captivating brand of storytelling, Kindra Hall was just getting started. Now she’s keynoting conferences in front of 7,000+, teaching the power of storytelling in business, and it’s been so inspiring to see her trajectory. It’s also proof that what she teaches works because she’s one of the best storytellers I’ve ever heard. Somehow over the years, Kindra Hall and I became friends on Instagram, and when I saw she had a book coming out that teaches how to use stories to transform your business through captivating your customers and influencing your audience, I knew we had to have her on The Kate & Mike Show. (Her book, Stories That Stick, is out this week wherever books are sold and it’s AH-MAZING. A must-read for any entrepreneur or person who wants to connect more deeply and effectively with other humans. Oh wait, that’s everyone.) If you’ve struggled with getting people on board with your vision... If you’re not making as many sales as you’d like or making them as easily as you’d like... If you feel like your story isn’t big enough to be worth telling... And if you’re ready to make your brand incredibly sticky so that your customers rave about you to everyone they know and keep coming back over and over again...then today’s episode is for you. Listen in to this week’s episode of The Kate & Mike Show with Kindra Hall to learn: • The 4 critical elements your story needs in order to be compelling • What storytelling, orgasms, and breastfeeding have in common • The obscure connection Kindra and I discovered during the episode that locked in my love for this new friend of mine • Why it doesn’t matter how big your story is, but what does matter instead • How to make sure your stories serve your audience and aren’t just self-indulgent You can get your own copy of Do Less and still receive incredible bonuses at http://katenorthrup.com/book!

What Dr. Cleopatra Abdou-Kamperveen realized is that she wanted to fail as soon as possible, so she could get on the right path even more quickly. As a newly tenured Professor with a proven pre-conception and fertility protocol that has a 97% success rate, Dr. Cleopatra was ready to get the word out there in a bigger way. Listen in to how she was able to shorten her learning curve as she got up to speed in online business and which elements were key for her growth and early mastery. It\'s been an incredible honor to support Dr. Cleopatra this year as part of the 2019 Origin Incubator, and I\'m so excited for you to benefit from her wisdom and apply it to growing your business! | Back in 2012, Mike and I were living in a drafty rental on Long Island figuring out how to live and work together. (Oh wait. Still trying to figure that out, minus the draftiness.) Over lunch at a little golf course cafe, we came up with an idea to give our community something they’d been asking for: access to my methodology on falling in love with your money. Here’s the problem: The methodology was alive and well inside my head and in the manuscript I was working on, but it didn’t live anywhere else yet. I’d taught some of it live before and I’d lived all of it, but I didn’t have proof that people would get out their credit cards and spend money to learn it yet. So, we decided to open the doors to The Money Love Course before the course had even been created. We had a list that was less than 10% of the size it is now. We had never created a course before, and I’d only ever taken one digital course before. We had never sold anything of our own online. We didn’t have any fancy tech knowledge or equipment. I had a lot of doubt as to whether or not what I had to share was valuable enough to sell because I’d only ever taught this material before for free. But we thought, "Well, what the heck? The worst-case scenario is that no one buys and then we’re no worse off than we are right now." So we went for it. And you know what? We made $20,000 in that one week, promoting a course that didn’t even exist yet. There are a lot of things that hold people back from getting started creating digital courses: I don’t know what I’m doing. Who do I think I am to be charging people for my knowledge and expertise? I’m not techy. I have a very small (or non-existent) audience. I’m a solo show and I have tons of other things to do. I don’t have time for this! Well, in today’s episode of The Kate & Mike Show we’re taking you behind the scenes back to 7 years ago when we got started with digital courses, and you’ll hear: • How we knew it was the right time to create a digital course • The incredibly simple setup of our first course launch and delivery • What we did to eventually create $123,000 with the launch of that same course • How we set up an automated system to bring in up to $50,000/month of recurring revenue from that same course, which helped us immensely during our first year of parenthood • How a friend of ours took our same plan and turned it into £18,000 within a week You can get your own copy of Do Less and still receive incredible bonuses at http://katenorthrup.com/book!

Following your heart and calling is not always the easy decision. But Sinclair Kennally has never tried to take the easy way out. Listen in to this special bonus episode of The Kate & Mike Show where we\'re going behind the scenes of this 2019 Origin Incubator member\'s business trajectory from manufacturing to e-commerce to wellness and detox for visionaries. You\'ll learn why every leader needs to be paying attention to their toxic burden if they want to function at their full potential, how we can all contribute to the greater good of the planet with our buying decisions, how to economy-proof your business, and what the critical ingredient for Sinclair was as she made these big leaps and changes this year (even in the face of great personal loss). | When Mike and I became parents, we experienced the most difficult year of our life up until that point due to a combination of the fact that becoming a parent is hard, I had a traumatic birth experience, I struggled with postpartum anxiety and insomnia, and we had a sick baby who would wake herself up throughout the night scratching herself so much from her severe eczema. It was not awesome on so many levels. However, the reason everything didn’t fall apart was because our business remained solid the whole time, despite the fact that both of us were working less than half the amount of time we’d worked previously. So how did we make our money that year? Digital courses that didn’t require us to trade hours for dollars (or be showered or coherent because we created them before having a kid). For us, having a thriving digital course business meant we kept it together (barely) during an incredibly grueling year and could be with each other and our baby without having to worry about how we were going to make money. For others, having a thriving digital course business means being able to homeschool their kids, travel to spend a month or more with family that lives far away, not needing to have as many (or any) 1:1 clients, being able to leave a job that feels soul-sucking, or being able to keep the doors open to the business that they love. What might having a thriving digital course business mean to you? There are a lot of misconceptions about what it takes to create and launch digital courses successfully. I don’t have anything special to teach. I don’t have a big enough (or any) audience. The digital course world is over-saturated. There’s no room for me. The tech is too complicated and I can barely navigate my email inbox! I wouldn’t even know where to begin.It’s too overwhelming. Turns out, creating a thriving digital course business is not necessarily what you think...and you CAN do it. Today we have a really special episode of The Kate & Mike Show featuring the QUEEN of digital courses, our dear friend and creator of Digital Course Academy, Amy Porterfield. In the episode she debunks the common myths about digital course businesses (including the ones listed above), and by the end of the episode you’re not only going to fully get that you can have the kind of freedom digital courses create in your business, you’ll also know how to get started. Here’s what you’ll learn: • How to get the 10% edge over the competition that makes all the difference • How one woman saved her business by selling 313 units of a $200 digital course on making caramel candied apples - and how you can use her story to inspire your successful course • 2 common mistakes that kill course creation success • What your #1 priority needs to be if you’re going to have a thriving digital course business • The counter-intuitive, but incredibly effective, strategy for deciding what to teach • How to determine which content to give away for free and what to charge people for (this is GOLD!) • How to stay ahead of the curve in the digital space And so much more!

This week I\'m introducing you to Whitney Bishop who\'s a change agent working in the non-profit space. She came to me wanting to lean into her thought leadership and create more leverage in her business, as well as begin to reach an audience beyond her native Louisville, KY. Listen in to hear what she did to expand this year, including what made the difference for her getting the impressive result of besting her 2018 revenue by the end of August of 2019! | If you want to leverage your time so that you don’t have to trade hours for dollars anymore, a digital course is an excellent idea. However, firing up your laptop and recording your voice over slides or shooting some videos and then getting them up on a password protected site by no means guarantees you’re going to have a successful digital course that reaches the people who need it and gives you the income you deserve. I want you to have wild success with your digital course (or maybe even courses) but I don’t want you to slow yourself down unnecessarily by making the mistakes we see over and over again. So, Mike and I recorded a brand new episode of The Kate & Mike Show for you to give you a few ounces of prevention. Whether the idea of creating a digital course is brand new to you or you’ve already created and launched one, this episode is for you. If I’d had this information 6 years ago when we first launched The Money Love Course, or even 2 years ago, I would have saved our company so much time and we would have helped more people (plus had more profits.) Don’t head on your digital course creation journey without a map. This is one area where winging it will cost you a lot of time and money unnecessarily.

There are several practical ways to build psychological safety inside your organization. We share what has worked for us at 15Five and how you can do it too.

That is an actual subjective experience that we as individuals need to be having before we’re actually having physiological safety.” [3:00] “Mistakes can happen and sometimes it’s just a lack of information or context. Those are opportunities to improve the business.”[12:32] “We all come to the table with an entire human story and lifetime of experience. When we get to share that story and experience and be seen, recognized, celebrated, and honored for that, that’s when the critter-brain relaxes enough that we can actually drop into a much deeper place of safety.” [19:32] “The path to becoming our best self is one where we are embracing our fullness - everything in our lives - and using that as the material for transformation and aspiring to something higher.” [25:40] “You as manager need to lead. The level that your people are going to be open, forthright, and transparent with you is directly correlated to the level you are leading with your own vulnerability and transparency.” [36:43] \xa0 Links Listen to Best-Self Management Here Find 15Five online Follow 15Five on Facebook | Twitter | Linkedin The Gottman Institute\xa0 Brene Brown Netflix Special Amy Edmondson Ted Talk on Psych Safety | If you’ve ever wondered how different your workplace experience would be if your day was full of positive emotional interactions, then you’re ready to hear about the philosophy that drives our company ethos.

It’s a shift in thinking from one where we believe that to be successful in business we have to get as much as we can from our people to a shift towards a belief that says we’re going to be successful if we support our people in thriving.”[1:35] “Now we’re in an environment where what matters is innovation and creativity and people being passionately engaged in service to the company. It’s not the output of an employee. It doesn’t come from how fast they can type on a keyboard or how many hours their butt is in the seat. It’s what they can create, the knowledge work, the innovation.” [4:35] “How much better, more productive, happier and fulfilled would you be if you were able to go to work and actually have more positive emotional interactions than negative ones on a day-to-day basis?” [12:22] “Why we work influences how we work.

They also interview academics, business leaders, and coaches, who are revolutionizing our understanding of human performance and what it takes to build a thriving culture that celebrates every employee and guides them towards greatness. \xa0 Links Listen to Season 1 of\xa0Best-Self Management Here Find 15Five online Follow 15Five on Facebook | Twitter | Linkedin | Your job is not simply a means to an end, a way of putting bread on the table. What if we looked at our jobs more as a way of expressing our creativity? This may sound like a radical idea, but as today’s guest explains, it’s not only possible but essential that we design an extraordinary employee experience that unlocks the potential of our people. Vanessa Shaw is the founder of the global community group the Workplace Lab, which is a welcoming environment for HR and talent leaders looking to discover how to innovate the employee experience. She supports leaders to bring empathy and creativity into the workplace, whether working with the United Nations, West Point cadets, or tech giants in Silicon Valley. Vanessa strives to help people answer the fundamental question, “Can my job be an expression of my creativity.” In our discussion, Vanessa sheds light on why creativity is an essential part of not just feeding our own needs but also for developing a thriving and supportive workplace. Indeed, supporting our creative side is one of the most powerful antidotes to stress. We also take a deep dive into the concept of “design thinking” and its role in engineering cultures.\xa0\xa0 Throughout, Vanessa discusses the shifting landscape of HR and how managers and leaders can meaningfully implement change without getting overwhelmed in the process. She shares some of the trends and themes that are happening in workplace cultures these days and how these can be implemented in any company to influence the employee experience.\xa0 For example, design thinking supports Diversity and Inclusion efforts due to its ability to pull in external voices and create cross-functional collaboration. When we are really close to things that we’ve built ourselves, we are making assumptions and often have a biased perspective. Diverse perspectives from different roles, levels in the organization, gender, race, and other perspectives help to test for bias. Solutions designed for one type of employee have serious design flaws because they are not inclusive.\xa0 What’s your experience with design thinking? How can HR leaders and managers enroll employees in creating an outstanding workplace culture? Let us know in the comments! In this episode  The lie that we need to outgrow our creative inclinations as we mature What “design thinking” is and how it is an integral part of fostering creative experiences Useful tools and techniques for identifying problems and solutions in collaborative work Why giving employees a sense of purpose and room to be creative is a better motivator than perks and bonuses Predictions about future trends in employee management\xa0 How to use “design thinking” to get the executive team on board with engineering a powerful company culture Three key questions that will kickstart your design thinking process  Quotes “You can see how [design thinking] becomes a really powerful tool as we’re looking to solve for diversity and inclusion, and create organizations that facilitate a sense of belonging for more than one type of employee.”\xa0 [12:51] “There’s a lot of pressure to reimagine the entire employee experience. From how we pay our employees, how we reward them, do performance management, everything is being unpacked and rethought and that’s overwhelming to do all at once.” [13:47] “Companies are made of people. If the individual parts internally are operating at their highest selves -- highest being possible -- then that’s going to reflect into everything we do.” [21:34] Links Find Vanessa Shaw at The Human Side of Tech Follow Vanessa on Linkedin | Twitter  Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey A.

But have you ever been around someone who does the opposite? As Anese Cavanaugh shares, even more than the words that we use, our energy is what most affects the people around us.\xa0 Anese Cavanaugh helps people show up and bring their best selves to the table to create a significant positive impact to their lives and the lives of everyone around them. She’s the creator of the IEP (intentional energetic presence) Method and is a speaker, advisor, and thinking partner to leaders worldwide. She is the author of Contagious Culture and The Leader You Will Be. Lookout for Contagious You: Unlock Your Power to Influence, Lead, and Create the Impact You Want, releasing November 2019! In this interview, Anese explains how we can all show up at work with intentionality behind what we want to have happen and how we interact with one other. Anese shares how we can be present and intentional with the energy we bring so that the people around us can feel better supported, inspired, and motivated. Throughout our conversation, Anese expertly explains how we influence others as leaders by subtly communicating our emotions and attitudes and how this can be harnessed in the workplace.\xa0 We also talk about how this all impacts company culture at large. It’s entirely possible to build a workplace where self-care is a cherished value. To this end, Anese deconstructs the myth that taking care of our own well-being is counterproductive. In fact, we can’t afford to ignore it any longer. What can you do to start being more intentional with your energy today? Share in the comments! In this episode  What the IEP Method is and how it can be indispensable to leaders in the workplace\xa0 The neuroscience behind how we influence each other with our energy Practical self-care tips when we need to regain control over how we’re feeling in the moment How and why to build a sustainable culture of self-care in the workplace The power that is within all of us to shift our state and become more intentional Why we can’t be in a high state all the time and it’s okay to feel down sometimes as long as we’re in touch with ourselves  Quotes “No matter what we say or do, there is always something that is communicating even more loudly underneath it, and it is usually our energetic presence.” [2:58] “We are moving fast and it’s not going to change. We’re going to always be moving fast so we have to get better. One of the things we can get better at is being really conscious about how we show up for ourselves and each other and be really conscious about our intentions, energy, and presence in anything we do.” [14:16] “Once I claim that my presence has an impact and how I show up matters and that I am the author of that, nobody can take that away from me.” [32:32] “You got to honor yourself first so that you can honor everybody else.” [41:40] Links Find Anese Cavanaugh online Follow Anese on Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Get your IEP resources here Contagious Culture by Anese Cavanaugh The Leader You Will Be by Anese Cavanaugh Heartmath \xa0 Listen to Best-Self Management Here Find 15Five online Follow 15Five on Facebook | Twitter | Linkedin | We’ve all heard people say things like “trust your heart” or “go with your gut.” But just what does that mean when applied within a workplace? It turns out that science is saying a lot about how we actually do think with these parts of our body. Joe Mechlinski has actually applied these concepts in the workplace with some magnificent results.\xa0 Joe is a New York Times best-selling author, speaker, and social entrepreneur. He greatly believes that having engaged employees is the key to unlocking human potential. Joe is the founder of SHIFT, a collective of businesses united by a common mission to create a more engaged workforce. Like us, Joe has a strong desire to revolutionize the workforce and drive engagement within an organization to levels many would think impossible.\xa0 In this interview, we dive deep into the theme of trust as an essential part of any functioning organization. We also explore the research around the intelligence of our hearts and guts and what the science says about the importance of listening to these vital parts of ourselves.\xa0 We go on to talk more about the importance of psychological safety at companies and building trust between employees and leadership. Without this mutual trust, there will always be limits to what the workforce can achieve and Joe shares some great ideas for how to establish it.\xa0 How do you show your vulnerability and that you trust your employees? Leave us a comment below! \xa0 In this episode:  How “following your heart” or “trusting your gut” are more than just cliches, but actual parts of a healthy decision making process What the science is saying about how you actually think with your heart and gut as well as with your brain How we can build a culture and organization that encourages us to leverage the intelligence of our hearts and guts What many companies inadvertently do that discourages their employees and how to avoid making the same mistakes Real ways to establish mutual trust within a company or organization  \xa0 Quotes: “The single greatest lever of a company’s potential is a more engaged workforce -- people who don’t dread Mondays, who don’t have the Sunday scaries, who aren’t watching the clock tick down every single day.” [7:23] “The way we think about the heart-brain connection is that it’s really connected to your passion, what you love to do. When you think about developing high-performers, they have a tendency to actually love what they do.” [11:55] “If you don’t trust your employees, they’re not going to trust you.” [23:59] “We’re going to find it really funny that every power structure in an organization is a pyramid and that there are these few people, mainly the CEO who makes all the decisions. And let’s be honest, the buck stops with that person. That is the dumbest, silliest way to construct cooperation in an organization.” [31:00] “You can’t go to the gym and just spectate, you’ll look like an idiot. I think the same thing about this work; I can’t spectate. I have to be at least part of the pack if not helping to promote and influence part of the pack.” [48:46] \xa0 Links: Find Joe Mechlinski at Shift the Work Follow Shift on Facebook | Twitter | YouTube | Linkedin | Instagram \xa0 Shift the Work by Joe Mechlinski Shift Happens podcast Stealing Fire by Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal\xa0 Team Human by Douglas Rushkoff The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman Bob Chapman’s Truly Human Leadership \xa0 Listen to Best-Self Management Here Find 15Five online Follow 15Five on Facebook | Twitter | Linkedin | Realizing our potential to become fully developed adult human beings is not an easy task and it doesn’t just happen on its own. At 15Five, we feel strongly that company retreats provide the opportunity for levels of growth and connection that people need to become their best selves. A retreat layered with emotional renewal and peak experiences, which Abraham Maslow believed was necessary to achieve self-actualization, can make all the difference for individuals as well as the company culture and overall business success. Today, we’re exploring the importance of retreats. We’ve been putting these together since the start, even when there were only a handful of us here launching the company. We still hold them every year and the benefits have been substantial! We explain the many benefits we have seen as the result of our company retreats and how to get your employees enthusiastically involved. The term "Corporate offsite" makes us cringe, and retreats are something completely different. They bring everyone together to align around the mission and company priorities, and also to build camaraderie and connection in a setting away from the office. We also see retreats as a way to strengthen a company’s culture and values. We talk about how we design our retreats to do this. Success here involves many factors such as choosing an inspiring location, creating effective content, facilitating deeper connections on the team, and delivering peak experiences along with time afterward for integration. Have you had transformational experiences as the result of a company retreat? Tell us about it in the comments! \xa0 In this episode:  The ROI that comes with a retreat that can’t easily be quantified Presenting the retreat to your employees so that they understand its real purpose - to accelerate business growth Retreats as times to truly reflect on and celebrate all the accomplishments that your business and employees have made The detailed structuring of a company-wide retreat including where to do them and what to focus on each day Candid and inspiring reflections that our employees have had about our retreats Taking advantage of great settings, activities, and places that will help inspire and excite your employees What happens when the retreat doesn’t go as planned Retreats as a space for your employees to connect to their own personal dreams and ambitions  \xa0 Quotes: “We really credit the retreats we’ve created, company-wide, the leadership team, and for departments, as one of the key drivers for building an extraordinary culture.” [1:55] “Take a moment to really smell the roses, to celebrate. In this start-up game it\'s so easy to constantly be focusing on the next mountain to climb and never actually sit down, have a cup of tea, look back over everything you’ve already done.” [9:05] “Get some time outside; be inspired by the natural world. We now know that being immersed in nature changes our entire brain chemistry and helps us shift gears into a different way of being.” \xa0[25:16] “You want to create an arc of experience.

Maslow, A Theory of Human Motivation Gallup Strengthsfinder Assessment Via Character Strengths Double Double by Cameron Herold | How can you have the life that you want, finding satisfaction in each moment through your work and experiencing a sense of flow and of purpose? This podcast is all about celebrating being your full self in the workplace. Too often we’re limiting our human potential in some very avoidable ways. Maybe your employees are worried about appearing too vulnerable to communicate what’s best for themselves or the company. Perhaps the leadership team isn’t modeling a supportive culture. Whatever it is, there are solutions! We’re David Hassell and Shane Metcalf, co-founders of 15Five, a leading continuous performance management software company with a strong focus on creating healthy and thriving workplaces. We started 15Five back in 2011. We\'re now in a high growth phase, hitting some pretty big revenue milestones, and recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of the\xa0Best-Places to Work. All of this while helping our 130+ employees become the best versions of themselves. We credit our many successes to the\xa0Best-Self Management methodology, which is based on the latest research in the fields of social science and positive psychology. By supporting people in being and becoming their best selves, higher and ever-increasing performance becomes a natural by-product, not to mention uncommon levels of passion, commitment, and loyalty. We’re here to share with you the many important lessons we’ve learned over the last eight years. In our first episode, our guests will be... ourselves! We interview each other about where we went right over the years and where we went wrong. We started with a belief that there’s a different way to do business and that the key to creating a thriving, sustainable company in the long term was supporting our people. Coming off our latest all-company retreat, many employees shared how unique an experience they had of connection with others and of a shift in mindset around what’s possible for their growth in a business setting. We also discuss the influence that managers can have via clear and regular communication with employees because managers have the greatest line of sight to a person’s motivations and challenges. Candid communication develops the trust required to have authentic relationships so that you can help employees succeed without being stymied by their own limiting belief systems. And of course, none of this is possible without having solid practices in place for your leadership team. For example, doing transformational personal development work is critical for having the types of epiphanies that inform the creation of a thriving culture. How can your workplace create an atmosphere in which employees feel comfortable sharing more openly? Tell us in the comments! \xa0 In this episode:  Creating intimacy in a room to cultivate vulnerability and deeper relating so that information and issues get shared Envisioning a company in which employees are given the support to become their best Moments of personal and professional growth that have influenced our workplace The belief and compassion necessary to help someone have the vision to change their life Creating a climate of psychological safety and trust so that everyone can feel comfortable sharing their fears and doubts Focus on the individual relationships between members of the leadership team to model a healthy working environment for all employees  \xa0 Quotes: “We had a really clear intention that we believed that there is a different way to do business and that the key to creating a thriving, sustainable, high-performing company for the long-term was that we felt if we could create an environment where people were supported and becoming their best selves and unlocking their potential, then things would take care of themselves.” [3:24] “I came to the realization prior to 15Five that it’s possible to grow and change and transform, that we’re not fixed and we’re not stuck with the life that we have, that we can actually go out and change ourselves and change the world if we want to.” [8:54] “You can’t see the potential in somebody unless you have experienced those moments of transcendence where you actually get to see that you yourself are capable of more than you think you are. That allows you to have faith that somebody is capable of more than they are currently demonstrating.” [13:05] “We’re typically terrified of truth. We’re typically terrified of feedback and hearing about negative experiences that other people might have of us. And yet it is the secret to good relationships to lean into that truth.” [28:38] \xa0 Links: Find 15Five online Follow 15Five on Facebook | Twitter | Linkedin \xa0 The Speed of Trust by Stephen M.R.

A Library was the first place I worked away from the office.\xa0 At Disney, I used to leave my office and work at an unoccupied office or work from the California Grill when it wasn\'t open.\xa0 Now, I still do work away from my office, which is in my house.\xa0 There are too many distractions at home. My productivity has gone up while working from a local coffee shop. When you are working outside your usual setting, you get more inspired. For me, I get more energy.\xa0 Put yourself in the right environment to get the work done.\xa0 There are jobs where you can\'t leave to work in a different environment. But you could still consider doing paperwork, catch up work, or your planning time away from where you work.\xa0\xa0 Working in the right environment will help you move items from your ToDo list to your Done list. The more you get done, the better your life will become.\xa0 | Is it better to have experience with a Brand Name company or a bigger role with a small company? This is something to consider, especially early in your career.\xa0 When you have a brand name like Disney on your resume, people notice. If you have worked at Disney or Marriott, other organizations will know you have received a high level of training and know how to serve customers.\xa0 On the other hand, you may be able to get a better spot at a smaller company to gain experience. Leadership experience with any organization can be valuable.\xa0 Smaller companies can be risky, though. Are you willing to take on more risk? Or, do you want a more comfortable and stable job? Hilton, Marriott, and Disney provided brand name experience for me. But I was also willing to move for the right opportunity. So I had the best of both worlds; brand name experience with the chance to take new roles for the experience.\xa0 Don\'t worry too much about the first 5 to 10 years of your career. Get as much experience and exposure as you can.\xa0 No matter what job you take, do a great job. Focus on making yourself better every day. If you do that, it won\'t matter as much what job you have and which company you work for.\xa0 For more insight into my career, check out my book Career Magic.\xa0 | People are looking for experts to help them.\xa0 The more you know about your products, the more people will trust you.\xa0 Knowing everything you possibly can about the products you offer will lead to better customer service.\xa0 Product knowledge doesn\'t happen by accident. You have to be deliberate. Schedule time to get out in your operation and see what is really happening. Use your product in the way customers will use your product.\xa0 If you are going to make it happen, you have to schedule it. Do it on purpose. When you are done, schedule when you will do it again. Never let up on the pressure and pursuit to know more about your product and how a customer does business with you.\xa0 Knowledge will help you control the business. You will know what is going on and people will want to help you.\xa0 If you work with vendors and third parties, it is your responsibility to make your expectations clear and hold them to a standard.\xa0 Don\'t recommend a product, service, or person unless you have first-hand knowledge.\xa0 Click Here to get my free Morning Magic Planner. | \xa0The customer is not always right, but they are always the customer.\xa0 Sure, people are going to take advantage of you. But overall, you still shouldn\'t make your policies too strict because a few people will take advantage of you.\xa0 Treat the customer like they matter to you.\xa0 Mr. Marriott told me, "Always give the customer the benefit of the doubt." Go in favor of the customer.\xa0 If you find a trend or something, in particular, getting abused and it becomes a problem, then you can make a policy dealing with it.\xa0 If a request is unreasonable, it may be time for the manager to get involved. But you will be better off given front line staff the ability to deal with customer requests.\xa0 Customers are more likely to continue to do business with you if you treat them with respect and make it easy to do business with you.\xa0 You will have to continue to find ways to get better faster. And find ways to serve customers in new ways.\xa0 | Your people are your brand. The way staff look represents your company to every customer who walks through the door.\xa0 At Disney, we have appearance guidelines because we are putting on a show. If you want to tell a story people will believe, everyone has to look like the part they are playing in the show.\xa0 Every business should have appearance guidelines. Staff should be dressed to fit the theme of your business. What do customers expect employees to look like when they visit your business?\xa0 Now put guidelines in place to govern clothes, hair, tattoos and other aspects of appearance your customers will see.\xa0 Don\'t make the mistake of thinking appearance only matters to companies like Disney. Every business is putting on a show. Appearance matters.\xa0 Giving attention to appearance guidelines is one way you can begin to build your reputation.\xa0 When it comes to implementing appearance guidelines, consider what message you want to send to your customers. Appearance guidelines will also give clarity to people upfront which will help people decide if they want to be part of the show you are putting on.\xa0 \xa0 | One of the most difficult things you will have to do as a leader is to handle uncomfortable situations with employees.\xa0 Talking to an employee about their behavior is hard. Terminating people is probably the hardest thing you will have to do.\xa0 All of the hardest things you have to do at work, and in life, involve people. Decisions about products are easy.\xa0 Unfortunately, too many people don\'t deal with the hard things. By letting it go, you are making your life harder. And you are not doing any favors to the other person either. By not dealing with the situation, you are holding them back from improving their life.\xa0 When difficult situations happen, a tough conversation or even termination, it won\'t feel good but you shouldn\'t feel guilty about it.\xa0 Remember, if you don\'t deal with the situation it will only get worse. These things don\'t get better on their own.\xa0 | For many people, your reputation will reach them before you have the chance to meet them in person.\xa0 Don\'t underestimate the impact your phone conversations have on people.\xa0 Your demeanor on the phone will help people know you are respectful, professional, helpful and will show people they can ask you hard questions. Phone conversations will help you build trust with people.\xa0 Don\'t do phone calls on a whim. Prepare for a call so you know what you want to accomplish while you are on the phone. Look something up about the other person before you talk to them. Don\'t let a phone call be a blind conversation.\xa0 When you handle phone calls the right way, people will feel like they already know you before they even get to meet you in person.\xa0 When you answer your phone, say your name. Cut out the confusion. "Hello, this is Lee." Right away, people will know who they are talking to.\xa0 Don\'t be afraid to ask questions and have a short personal conversation when you are on the phone. People want to feel like they matter. If you only stick to business when you call, you can\'t build a relationship. In a 30 second conversation, you may get an answer to your questions, but you won\'t learn much about a person. And you won\'t make them feel special.\xa0 \xa0 | Taking time to celebrate milestones is an important part of any organizations culture.\xa0 With that, we are taking the opportunity to celebrate episode 250 of Creating Disney Magic.\xa0 Over the past 5 years, with each episode approximately 15 minutes long, we have produced more than 62 hours of lessons in leadership, management and customer service. If you have listened to the episodes, with only 15 minutes once per week, you have accumulated a lot of information. Perhaps more information than if you took a university course on leadership. It doesn\'t take much to make a big difference.\xa0 Another lesson from creating 250 episodes, is if you get started you can create something special. But you have to get started, put in the time to do the work and you can become an expert. When Jody Maberry and I started this podcast we didn\'t know where it would go or what it would become.\xa0 Here is the most important lesson from this episode, you need to take the time to celebrate milestones. Everyone likes to be recognized and celebrated. Plus, when you celebrate milestones and accomplishments, it shows other people what it takes to get recognized. As people understand what types of situations you celebrate, it helps build culture.\xa0 We all want positive comments and feedback. Take a moment to celebrate yourself and those around you.\xa0 If you want to help me celebrate the 250 episode milestone, would you consider leaving a rating and review for the podcast? Here is a direct link to leave an iTunes review.\xa0If you listen in another platform and they allow reviews, please go ahead and leave a review there.\xa0 Thank you for your support. We wouldn\'t have gotten to 250 episodes without you.\xa0 | Some people don\'t get the development they need at home. Working with you is the first opportunity they have to learn how to be professional and get ahead in life.\xa0 We all have ability and potential if developed properly. But not everyone gets the development they need to be successful.\xa0 As a leader, your responsibility goes beyond technical training. Upfront, let them know what matters. Be clear. Then teach them how to be great.\xa0 Developing employees helps your customers, but it also flows out into their personal life.\xa0 One of the most satisfying things in your life is the impact you have on other people.\xa0 Be a teacher. Not a boss.\xa0 | If you want to get your message out, you have to do the work.\xa0 Don\'t count on people hearing your message until you put it directly in front of them.\xa0 Sometimes you have part-time staff who aren\'t always around. Or staff on different shifts.\xa0 Use technology to make sure all staff members hear the same message no matter what time they work. Or, move around meeting times. If you want to figure it out, you will figure it out.\xa0 Don\'t worry about annoying staff by getting your message out so often. Worry more about making sure you are clear.\xa0 Write out what you expect, why you do what you do, and what employees can expect.\xa0 If you want to get your message out, you will have to say it over and over. When you feel like you are saying it too much, people are just now beginning to pay attention.

Unlike other mouthpieces, Orchid’s pen has a wide body for enhanced airflow. The cartridges can hold five times the typical amount of apertures to ensure the cotton wick is more saturated with oil.

But in this episode, Dan Sullivan and Shannon Waller explain how you can instead link up with people so that everyone’s doing what they want to do while working toward your company’s goals. | Intelligence, smarts, and IQ are only part of the success formula for entrepreneurs. You can be the smartest person in the room, but if you're not in the habit of taking action and recognizing opportunity, you have no advantage over anyone else. Dan and Shannon share the difference between your mind and your brain, and how to use them both for a rich and fulfilling life. | Most entrepreneurs charge according to what their competition is charging, but that isn’t the way to get what you’re worth. In this episode, Dan Sullivan and Shannon Waller talk about why setting your price should be determined by what customers will be willing to pay. | Most people are held back by how much time and effort they think is needed to get big results. In this episode, Dan Sullivan and Shannon Waller talk about a way of thinking that allows you to go against gravity. | Even if you know that you need an entrepreneurial coach, how do you know the differences and benefits of one-on-one vs. group coaching? Dan Sullivan and Shannon Waller share insights on how to make the right decision, and how the community you'll discover in a Strategic Coach workshop is part of what keeps entrepreneurs with us for life. | Female entrepreneurs face obstacles that male entrepreneurs don’t because of expectations of both men and women. In this episode, Dan Sullivan and Shannon Waller explain how, if they stick with it and become successful, female entrepreneurs will eventually have advantages over their male peers. | A lot of entrepreneurs are motivated to introduce an idea that will disrupt an industry, but there will be negative reactions and consequences to taking that approach. In this episode, Dan Sullivan and Shannon Waller talk about how it’s better to focus on creating something new than to attack something that already exists. | Highly-charged emotional reactions are normal. Especially when you’re dealing with unexpected wins and big upsets. It’s what you learn from those experiences, however, that can have the biggest impact on your future success. In this episode, Dan Sullivan shares some personal life experiences that he transformed into big breakthroughs as well as a process you can use to take the good and bad from every situation and learn from it. | Managing is about being given answers, while coaching is about being asked good questions so you can come up with your own answers. In this episode, Dan Sullivan and Shannon Waller explain why coaching is what’s needed for entrepreneurs to keep growing.", 'chan_desc': 'Inside Strategic Coach is a practical resource for entrepreneurs, or anyone with a growth mindset.

Your Champion needs to be able to answer to the bean counters how you are delivering an ROI You have to remind your customers how good you are Determine what success looks like with your prospect before they buy so you both know what the expectations are Harvard Professor Theodore Levitt, "People don\'t buy a quarter-inch drill. They buy a quarter-inch hole." Salespeople push to a closed deal The buyer is terrified once they close Our customers are not professional buyers They buy outcomes Change is the catalyst for new opportunities Stick around and deliver value after the sale You must know why they bought There is so much turnover with both your sales team and at your companies Somebody has to stick around and own customer success The good and bad comes from the sales side There are more influencers on the buyer\'s side (9.3 on average) The buyer wants to know "Who understands me and what I\'m trying to accomplish?" The fundamentals have not changed but they are not being followed Buyers have too much information. It\'s noisy. Buyers have been abused by past, shady, pushy salespeople How did you get that meeting? Why are you in front of the prospect? Don\'t show up and throw up! Have an agenda for the sales meeting. "Lead them to your solution not with your solution." Play hard to get. There\'s value in scarcity. Does technology make you more effective?

One way to disagree better is to respond to their bid to be seen, not with miserly reticence, […] | In this episode If you believe someone is aggressive, could they behave more aggressively with you than with others? If someone believes you are a hostile person, are you likely to act more hostile when you interact with them? It’s called behavioral confirmation and if you’re interested in your own or others’ conflict behavior, it’s […] | In this episode Only people we love and care deeply about can make us so angry we want to blow a gasket, says famed Star Trek actor George Takei. When someone or something we care deeply about sparks big anger, here’s a way to turn anger into curiosity and use it positively. Show notes This […] | In this episode This is a replay of a 2018 episode. When I ask clients why they let a problem go on for so long before addressing it, a common reply is, “I was afraid I’d create more conflict by raising it.” It’s an understandable fear. Here are some tried-and-true ways to raise an issue […] | In this episode The outset of a difficult conversation often feels like a back-and-forth trading of position and perspective with little common ground. Here’s how to use the psychology of agreement to begin shifting that kind of positional debate to collaborative problem solving. Show notes Jim Collins’ “right people on the bus” About shared reality […] | In this episode It feels productive to toss out ideas for a solution and demonstrate how much we want to help. But it’s usually unproductive if we haven’t done something essential first: Make sure we understand the problem from their frame of reference. Show notes Eureka! vs. “Hmm, that’s interesting…” | In this episode When we’re overwhelmed by a difficult conversation, one reason can be that we’re too focused on the horizon and not focused enough on the very next step. A very helpful mindset in moments like this is to “do the next right thing.” Show notes Burlington Taiko drummers at the Vermont City Marathon […] | In this episode When we listen well, sometimes others hog air time and just keep talking. It’s an inadvertent, and often unwelcome, side effect of good listening. Here’s a way I like to handle long-winded talkers that’s both effective and kind. | In this episode When confronting difficult behavior, we typically focus on what we want the other person to stop doing. Sometimes this works. But too often, we create a “behavior vacuum” with this approach, making it harder for them to stop the difficult behavior. Here’s how to avoid this common misstep.

Today we have a fun conversation about a 1998 trip we took to California and how we could not agree on modern art. Through this, we discovered how people don’t always agree on art and culture; and why we don’t actually need to agree in order to get along.\xa0 So how do art and culture relate to work? Well, we also discuss hiring and culture, and how that is manifested at work. How is your company using the word “culture” within the corporate context? This topic of “culture” within the workplace needs so much attention. This episode focuses on gaining clarity on the topic of “culture” and the importance of asking the real questions you need to have answered about a company. So if you’re interested in gaining a clearer perspective on “culture” and how that can happen at your office, be sure to listen to this week’s episode of Let’s Fix Work. In this episode, you’ll hear:  Some details about our trip to California and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, as well as some of the pieces that stood out to us The importance of culture and art with regard to differing opinions and the one piece of modern art in particular that we discussed at length that bugged my husband, Ken, and his struggle to label it is art Ken’s view of culture at work - what it’s like to communicate with each other and be a part of the team The importance of asking the real, specific, honest questions about work that you want answered and not to erode the meaning of the word “culture” Some companies do not have a culture, and if they do, it varies from one location to another The need to look at company culture honestly and why companies may need to do audits to understand culture and motivation  Resources from this episode:  Hiring for Culture is Broken Presentation  SFMOMA.ORG Dan Flavin, the diagonal of May 25, 1963, 1963 at SFMOMA\xa0 Ackland Art Museum  Brittany Runs a Marathon Alamo Drafthouse Cinema - Raleigh Laurie on Instagram Read more from Laurie Work with Laurie *** EPISODE CREDITS: If you like this podcast and are thinking of creating your own, consider talking to my producer, Danny Ozment.

If you are wondering what podcasting has to do with work, well, I often get asked questions about individual podcasting and enterprise podcasting. Questions like, “How do we do this in our organization?” “How do we have a podcast where the CEO talks to the employees, but we keep it confidential?” Or, “How do we have a podcast for the marketing department to let other departments within the organization know the cool things that we're working on?” And I don't really have any of those answers. But my fantastic podcast producer, Danny, does have the answers. So today we talk about individual and enterprise podcast strategies that work. As well as who Danny is and how he got into podcasting, we also go through some of my listeners’ questions on what this wide world of podcasting is and how it can help to fix work. So if you're interested in employee communications, if you want to help people communicate more effectively, if you want to foster creativity, collaboration, and transparency, I think podcasting might be a solution for you. So sit back, and listen to this episode of Let’s Fix Work.   In this episode, you’ll hear:  Danny’s “why” for why he works in podcasting, why podcasts are the one good form of new media for one long conversation and for sharing real stories. The growth and popularity of podcasting More than 50% of Americans listen to podcasts, and that number has been rising for 10 years. Of those, 90% consume at least half of the episode. What enterprise podcasting is and how podcasts can be protected inside a business to keep information confidential. Why corporations are choosing podcasting as a vehicle to communicate important messages. How a podcast happens at work and the main element needed to create one.\xa0 The basic necessary equipment and process to record and produce a podcast.

Julie is the VP of Product Design at Facebook and the author of the new book, The Making of a Manager: What To Do When Everyone Looks to You. Julie was also the first ever intern at Facebook in 2006. Yes, that’s right! And now she's VP of Product Design. It's her job to make Facebook look great. I first met Julie almost a year ago at the Watermark Conference for Women in Silicon Valley, an event where a bunch of smart, powerful, and successful women come together to brainstorm how to take over the world. I joined Julie for a panel about “managing up,” which is basically making the people ahead of you or above you, on the organizational chart, happier. During our conversation, I was excited to learn she was writing a book about managers and knew immediately I wanted to have her on the podcast as a guest when her book came out. And, well, here we are! On today's episode, Julie and I talk about the difference between managers and leaders, as well as organizational trust. Plus, we tackle a topic that we've tackled on the show before, but Julie has some pretty specific ideas around it; and that's feedback. So if you're interested in hearing about managers, leaders, and some nuanced ideas about feedback, then sit back and listen to this episode of Let’s Fix Work. In this episode, you’ll hear:  What inspired Julie to write the book, “Making of a Manager”\xa0 Why people overcomplicate the world of management How and why the lines between manager and therapist seem to be blurred these days The difference between leadership and management\xa0 About the point in Julie’s career when she moved from manager to leader and how she knew she actually made the jump The three things that managers should be thinking about about every day How Julie’s book can be helpful for professionals who don't have access to management or leadership training; plus she answers the question, “Do you need to take classes in order to be a good manager?” About how our culture doesn't know how to give feedback, discerning the good from the bad, and what great feedback looks like   Resources from this episode: The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You  Power Players: the most important Facebook execs you've never heard of Julie Zhuo’s morning routine Julie Zhuo on LinkedIn Julie’s website Watermark Conference for Women Laurie on Instagram\xa0 Read more from Laurie Work with Laurie *** EPISODE CREDITS: If you like this podcast and are thinking of creating your own, consider talking to my producer, Danny Ozment.

Nearly 3,000 people.\xa0 The 2996 project aims to remember those people. For years, I've been writing about Claudia Martinez Foster. Claudia had a fun life.\xa0 She wanted to start a family. She loved children. She loved makeup.\xa0 She had a job on the 105th floor of Tower One, World Trade Center. And, she lost her life on September 11th, 2001, at work.\xa0 I will never stop writing or talking about Claudia.\xa0 This week I wanted to share with you my thoughts on old Labor Day traditions, the emergence of the “new” Labor Day and remembering 9/11.\xa0 If the topic of terrorism is hard for you (as it is for many of us) or you’ve lost someone on 9/11, this episode might be one you want to skip.\xa0 In this episode, you’ll hear:  My memorial to Claudia Martinez Foster Why the idea of Labor Day as a union holiday is an old and stupid idea The new Labor Day, a day for remembering, a day of service and moving towards self-awareness A reminder that you have a chance to do something great, don’t blow it  Resources from this episode:  Claudia Foster, 26, broker's assistant, loved children  Claudia Martinez Memorial It’s Important to Remember  Cocktails Before the Collapse Project 2996 And on Facebook:\xa0https://www.facebook.com/Project2996/\xa0\xa0 Laurie on Instagram Read more from Laurie Work with Laurie *** EPISODE CREDITS: If you like this podcast and are thinking of creating your own, consider talking to my producer, Danny Ozment.

Do you love chasing down invoices and getting four hours of sleep a night because you're worried about the future? Yeah, I didn’t think so. In fact, nobody probably really loves any part of the side hustle. More on that in a moment. But first, meet this week’s guest, Mary Ellen Slayter. She's the Founder and CEO of Rep Cap Media, a B2B Marketing agency focused on helping their clients create leads, sales, and revenue. Of course, Mary Ellen is so much more than that. She's a scientist. She's a journalist. She's a former writer at the Washington Post. And she's also a mother, a partner, and an absolute dear friend.\xa0 Mary Ellen is also someone who has a strong opinion on entrepreneurship and the hustle economy.\xa0 Now, I don't know when the word hustle emerged in our lexicon as a good thing, but Mary Ellen and I are here to tell you it is not a good thing. It is not a proper way to live your life. It's not a proper way to be connected to the people you love. And it certainly isn't a good way to run a business. So if you're interested in hearing about the side hustle (and why it’s actually no good) and thinking about solutions for the future of work, listen in to this episode of Let’s Fix Work.\xa0 In this episode, you’ll hear:  What is causing the emergence and negative trend where we're just working all the time without stopping The driving force behind the hustle economy How the hustle economy affects men and women differently Some ways that we can fight the hustle Some sales advice from Mary Ellen  Resources from this episode: Mary Ellen Slayter on LinkedIn Rep Cap Media https://www.12geniuses.com/ https://ryanestis.com/ Laurie on Instagram Read more from Laurie Work with Laurie \xa0 \xa0 *** EPISODE CREDITS: If you like this podcast and are thinking of creating your own, consider talking to my producer, Danny Ozment.

Some people refer to him as the most disruptive man in human resources. Is that hyperbole? Is that true? Well, on the surface, Victorio is a human resources consultant, a father, a husband, and a volunteer.\xa0 He also is a hobbyist photographer. So yes, he's got a normal life. But he is also the founder of a movement called #fixitSHRM. SHRM is the Society for Human Resource Management. Why does it need to be fixed? Well, that's exactly what we're talking about today. What would you do if an association that represents you starts to behave in a way that you don't agree with? Do you stay with it? Do you leave it? Do you speak up? What happens when you try to reach out to the leadership and they don't respond? Victorio was faced with this dilemma, he made his choice and the #fixitSHRM movement was born.\xa0 I will let you decide whether or not you believe Victorio is in the right or wrong. But this is for sure, our conversation is one worth listening to and worth having, without a doubt.\xa0 So if you're interested in a conversation about ethical leadership and hearing about one man’s attempt to fix an organization he feels is misrepresenting HR, then sit back and listen to this episode of Let’s Fix Work.\xa0 In this episode, you’ll hear:  Why people describe Victorio as disruptive in the world of human resources Victorio’s definition of ethical leadership, what is it and why it matters Leadership begins with us, it starts at a local level SHRM and how Victorio feels about it We discuss whether or not people need a seat at the table in Washington to truly affect change Why Victorio feels his battle with SHRM is important The HR workforce’s role and responsibility in the world of HR Some parallels Victorio sees between the world of HR and the world of photography  Resources from this episode: Victorio on Twitter Victorio on LinkedIn Humareso\xa0 Creative Photography Consulting Skyword\xa0 Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) \xa0 Articles of interest: Well-known advocate to lead White House board on historically black colleges\xa0  SHRM CEO Johnny C.

I’m Clay (short for Claytonious).I have the privilege of being the lead pastor of North Point Community Church (NPCC) in Alpharetta, GA, but I didn’t start in that role. Beginning as a facilities intern (a.k.a. Vice-President of Nothing), I worked my way through many organizational levels and learned all too well the challenge of authority deprivation.As the original and largest campus of North Point Ministries, which was ranked by Outreach Magazine in 2014 as the largest church in America, NPCC averages over 12,000 people weekly. Living in the shadow of Andy Stanley, one of the greatest leaders on the planet IMHO, I understand the tension of how to lead when you’re not in charge. But, truth be told, don’t we all?If you’re wondering what I do all day long, you’re not alone. As the campus pastor, I provide visionary and directional leadership for all of the local church staff and congregation in Alpharetta.With slight regret, because of the torturous amount of calculus and physics, I have an industrial engineering degree from Georgia Tech. More applicably, I have a master’s degree and a doctorate with an emphasis in online church from Dallas Theological Seminary. I live in Forsyth County, Georgia, with my wife, Jenny, and our five lively children, Lucy, Jake, Sally, Cooper, and Whit.Subscribe to our podcast on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/l3-leadership-podcast-leadership-entrepreneurship-business/id495751888?mt=2\xa0Listen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/3CBHbRL6rJtSXwpKBaamNo?si=8ZllK41EQnaKHcqNkNUj5wListen on Overcast: https://overcast.fm/itunes495751888/l3-leadership-podcastListen on Tunein: http://tun.in/piVUO\xa0Subscribe to our podcast on Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/learning-to-lead-podcast\xa0Subscribe on Google Play: https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Iehhmsctsgmvmoyvhxsv6yfzoiu https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Iehhmsctsgmvmoyvhxsv6yfzoiu\xa0Our Vision:\xa0L3 Leadership exists to build and develop a community of leaders that grow to their maximum potential, develop the courage to pursue their dreams, and to become great leaders in their families, communities, cities, nations, and their world.

You HAVE to get good at this. Here is what your responsibility is and a few tools to help you improve at this critical skill. What you'll find in this episode:  Your only responsibility in regard to feedback is just to give it. Don’t give it when you’re angry or don’t have all the information yet, and don’t base it on other people’s opinions. Step one – be direct and teacher-like. Step two - engage them and get them to talk. Determine if it’s a mindset issue or a skill set issue. Advice on what to do with new employees. Third step – now you must transition into performance conversations (we'll talk about this in another episode). Another reason why getting good at feedback is super powerful for a female entrepreneur. The goal of feedback is to give someone perspective that will help them change their performance so they get a different and better result.  © 2019 Kris Plachy Visit: KrisPlachy.com for show notes and available downloads Email: support@leadershipcoachllc.com Kris on Facebook @krisplachycoach on Instagram Kris on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | Kris talks with Kim Hall, founder of Physio2U, the largest in-home physical therapy company in Western Canada.

What you'll find in this episode: 1) What Kim’s business growth has required she learn about herself. 2) Advice for those who feel they don’t have time to build out the various systems in their business that allow them to move into an overseeing role. 3) “You have to live it to give it.” – Kris 4) The unexpected thing that Kim learned. 5) Why Kim thinks it’s challenging to manage adults/professionals. 6) “Until you clear your mind and emotions of this extra stuff that we all bring, you won’t be able to be an effective manager.” – Kim\xa0 7) “I’ve learned that other people don’t work as hard as the founder does.” – Kim\xa0 8) “You have the choice, and you can create the life you want.” – Kim 9) “A lot of people quit because of the people part.” – Kris\xa0 10) “Continue to dream big and imagine the life you want to create for yourself.

Here’s the big mistake we all make, and how to keep it from being a drag on your business. What you'll find in this episode:  Accountability is your ability to account for someone else’s ability. If we, collectively, as business leaders, decided to consistently account for our employees’ ability, we would change the world. People who don’t care or want to be held accountable don’t hate you. They don’t like the transparency of witnessing their own inadequacy. Age is not related to accountability. It’s experience, and it’s the way people think. The first mistake we all make is hiring someone and assuming they’ll hold themselves accountable. Thinking about hiring someone to solve a problem is the seed of accountability. Once you know what the solution looks like, now you know the role that position must fill. Accountability is not a corporate thing – it’s a relationship thing.  © 2019 Kris Plachy Visit: KrisPlachy.com Email: support@leadershipcoachllc.com Kris on Facebook @KrisPlachy on Twitter @krisplachycoach on Instagram Kris on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | Gossip is “talking to anyone about anything who doesn’t have any control to solve it.” It’s destructive to your business, and here are the foundational tools you need to fix it. What you'll find in this episode:  Why you have to know what your values are in your business. Listen to the previous podcast called “Entrepreneurial Values” here. The importance of setting expectations based on your values. How a company manifesto and a team book (not a policy book) can help. If you have all of that in place, and you still have an issue – you have an accountability gap.  © 2019 Kris Plachy Visit: KrisPlachy.com Email: support@leadershipcoachllc.com Kris on Facebook @KrisPlachy on Twitter @krisplachycoach on Instagram Kris on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | If you feel exhausted and impatient, it could be burnout. But your burnout is not because of your business. Burnout comes from your brain. Here are 5 things that are likely causing your burnout. What you'll find in this episode:  Burnout comes from your brain, and your body follows your brain. What are you indulging in your mind? Another cause of burnout is lack of decisions. Kris’ coach used to say, “Do it. Dump it. Delegate it.” Right now. Burnout comes from overworking in unproductive effort. Your lack of boundaries is also another cause of burnout. You’re too available. Another, you’re buffering. Entrepreneurs use their businesses to avoid feeling things.  © 2019 Kris Plachy Visit: KrisPlachy.com Email: support@leadershipcoachllc.com Kris on Facebook @KrisPlachy on Twitter @krisplachycoach on Instagram Kris on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | Kris talks with Eleanor Beaton, founder of Fierce Feminine Leadership, an organization that helps ambitious women develop the confidence, presence, political savvy and influence they need to smash the glass ceiling. What you'll find in this episode:  One of the most important factors for a leader is embarrassability. What Eleanor thinks makes a great team. “For me, the thing that threads a team together is this sense of trust in one another.” – Eleanor A great team is a group of men and women who also challenge our sense of who we are and cause that to expand. I have found as I brought people into my team, that they have their own zones of genius and that allows me to continue to withdraw from certain areas and focus on a smaller area that has broader impact. – Eleanor Eleanor’s vision. “I love the men! I coach men! I love the men! But women lead differently.” – Kris Plachy “Delegation does give you time… eventually.” – Kris Plachy “As soon as you have the right team, everything is exponentially better.” – Kris Plachy “To do consistent effort over time, we have to be able to rest and catch our breath through the hard things.” – Eleanor “Don’t worry if your body shakes, it’s just weakness leaving your body.” - Kris’ yoga instructor  © 2019 Kris Plachy Visit: KrisPlachy.com Email: support@leadershipcoachllc.com Kris on Facebook @KrisPlachy on Twitter @krisplachycoach on Instagram Kris on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | We recently looked at when to fire a team member. This episode is about when NOT to fire a team member. It’s a step by step thought process and it’s NEVER easy. What you'll find in this episode:  First, you have to do the audit.\xa0 Second – question your reason. Are you in a position of emotional reaction to what someone is doing? Third – ask your business. Would you apply this decision to fire this person to anyone else on your team or is it just this person? Would you be consistent.  © 2019 Kris Plachy Visit: KrisPlachy.com Email: support@leadershipcoachllc.com Kris on Facebook @KrisPlachy on Twitter @krisplachycoach on Instagram Kris on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | Finish this sentence – “I will finally feel relief when …” What is that “thing” that, when finally achieved, will cause the overwhelm and stress to end for you? Good news! Here’s how to feel the joy sooner rather than later. What you'll find in this episode:  Relief doesn’t come from the “thing,” it comes from the way that you think. If you’re telling yourself that there is relief out there “when,” then you’re setting up a tension between where you are today and where you think the relief exists. That just sets you up to be uncomfortable chronically. Of the five relationships you must develop as an entrepreneur, the relationship with your brain is the most powerful and least utilized performance tool. Your exercise is to answer the question – what are you telling yourself right now is your relief point?  © 2019 Kris Plachy Visit: KrisPlachy.com Email: support@leadershipcoachllc.com Kris on Facebook @KrisPlachy on Twitter @krisplachycoach on Instagram Kris on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | Here are the basics you have to have in place in order to know when to fire someone and when NOT to fire someone. What you'll find in this episode:  #1 – Set clear expectations. #2 – Review their work. #3 – Give them feedback. The way you know it’s time to fire is you’ve set the expectations, you’ve reviewed their work and given them the feedback and they’re just not meeting the objectives of the role.\xa0 The way you know it’s not time to fire is when you’re bent out of shape and in total judgement.  © 2019 Kris Plachy Visit: KrisPlachy.com Email: support@leadershipcoachllc.com Kris on Facebook @KrisPlachy on Twitter @krisplachycoach on Instagram Kris on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | Are you having unsupervised thinking? You’re not alone. Many of those thoughts are probably negative in some way. Here’s a list of thoughts you can think instead. What you'll find in this episode:  Your business is hard because YOU THINK IT IS! Things to think instead:  I’m getting better at it every day. Look at what I’ve built. I’m in the process of figuring it out.\xa0 A la Danielle LaPorte Of course it happened that way. I’m totally capable. I can and will ask for help. I’m not alone. I’m really good at failing so I can succeed.   The worthiness of you is always innate. It doesn’t go away. You’ve always had it and you can never lose it. Comparing thoughts is detrimental.

We’re talking to some of the leading thinkers, entrepreneurs and executives in energy — people who’ve grappled with extreme change — and bringing their stories to you.And of course, we’re going to hear about what they’ve learned from other areas of business, at a time when companies of all kinds are constantly under threat.We are still in the early stages of production, but we’ll be dropping episodes later this fall. So don’t go anywhere.\xa0 | Over the last four episodes, we’ve detailed the history of corporate innovation, wins and fails in customer strategies, the winding path of technology adoption, and the role of big corporates in catalyzing change.We’ve been talking about the recent and distant past, trying to understand how it applies to the competitive challenges that energy companies face today.In this episode, we are revisiting those themes — and looking to the future — with Tendril CEO Adrian Tuck.Adrian has two decades of experience building companies and bringing technologies to market. He spends a lot of time thinking about what other industries can teach utilities about embracing disruptive change.We’ll talk start the episode by looking at the impact of artificial intelligence with Erik Brynjolffson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. AI is mostly good at narrow tasks — and that leaves a lot of room for the things that humans are good at: creativity, relationships, persuasion, leadership.Then, Adrian joins us to talk about how AI will impact the energy industry. He’ll also share thoughts on other emerging tech trends, how utilities can set up a culture of innovation, and why leaders fail to embrace change.ILLUMINATORS is brought to you by Tendril, a software and analytics leader changing the way the world uses energy.

How can a fierce dedication to the customer change the fabric of a company? And how can companies fail when they lose sight of their customers?Sometimes the customer isn’t who you think. JCPenney is an iconic retailer who failed to understand its customers’ needs and became “America’s favorite cautionary tale.” In the first part of the show, we’ll look at why the retailer failed in a bid to reinvent itself.Sometimes it takes an outsider to step back and understand what the customer wants. That’s what happened when lawyer Herb Kelleher started Southwest Airlines. He didn’t have any airline experience, but he created a human resources culture that made employees happy -- and made customers happy in the process.Finally, we’ll profile Mary Powell, the CEO of Green Mountain Power, who makes interaction with customers a central part of her job. She’ll describe her approach to customer centricity and innovation: "One of my biggest fears is being out of touch with what people want and what really matters to people."Guests featured in this episode:Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia UniversityJody Hoffer Gittell, professor of management at Brandeis UniversityMary Powell, president and CEO of Green Mountain PowerResources:Mark Cohen’s Forbes article about management problems at JCPenneyJody Hoffer Gittell’s book, “The Southwest Airlines Way”Forbes article on Mary Powell and Green Mountain Power’s customer obsessionILLUMINATORS is brought to you by Tendril, a software and analytics leader changing the way the world uses energy.

He created a whole new way to make and sell his inventions — setting the stage for modern corporate innovation. His model influenced a generation of titans: General Electric, Westinghouse, Ford, and the electric utility as we know it today.And then, something shifted.In the 1970s, executives of large companies turned their attention to “shareholder value.” They valued efficiencies, cost cutting and dividends over invention and innovation. Today, when a startup with a few software engineers can present a competitive threat to a big incumbent in a very short period of time, this presents an existential challenge.We\'ll start this episode with a re-examination of Thomas Edison’s legacy. How did he set the stage for modern corporate innovation?Then, we’ll talk about the limits of that model. How can corporations shift from “big to bigger” mindsets into “new to big” strategies?

Are we in the middle of an “electric-motor moment” for the modern economy?Then, we’ll reflect on Walmart’s groundbreaking push into sustainability back in 2005. What does it tell us about how to craft a purpose-driven business case?We’ll finish with a conversation about Xcel Energy’s goal to get 100% of its energy from zero-carbon resources by 2050.

I read from his book  Defeat into Victory: Battling Japan in Burma and India, 1942-1945 .\xa0 According to historians Alan Millet and Williamson Murray Slim was:\xa0 “A hardened field soldier who had learned his trade on the Western Front and in the Indian Army, Slim combined troop-leading and training skills with personal and moral courage as well as charm, a sound grasp of soldiering, and a solid appreciation of Asian warfare and the excellence of the\xa0Japanese Army.” Slim took lessons learned from the defeat in 1942 to heart, and used them to transform the training and tactics of the troops he was responsible for. The result was a sound defeat of Japan in 1944-45. Episode Highlights include:\xa0  The Commander’s Duty: Victory\xa0 What it means to succeed as a construction leader Three causes of British defeat   Lack of Preparation\xa0 Unclear Overall Objective and Strategy\xa0 Poor Execution   How silos and poor communication hinder success\xa0 Why terrain specific training is vital and how that applies in construction\xa0 Why sharing bad news with your employees is essential to avoiding defeat The necessity of a clear objective communicated from the executive level The importance of good intelligence\xa0 How to conduct a debrief on failed projects\xa0   Questions include:   What worked?\xa0 What didn’t work?\xa0 What will we do differently, knowing what we now know?\xa0     Ways to avoid failure in the future\xa0 The learning from your failures and then moving on  | I welcome back to the show Scott Gable, CEO of CityLift Parking, a company that is revolutionizing the way buildings are built in the United States, particularly in urban, land constrained environments. CityLift Parking designs, installs, and services automated parking systems that reduce the footprint needed for parking and can typically be done at a lower cost per space than conventional parking.

The content is very valuable for me and I have recommended the podcast to all my colleges. I work as a design manager in Sweden and something I would love an episode about how we as young managers can lead our teams when we still don’t have so much experience in different technically advanced areas. This is a big issue in Sweden and probably in other parts of the world as well, where we have a generation shift and many young professionals in a highly demanding position.  Thanks to Sina for his question. In this episode I’ll discuss three thing young construction managers can do to become effective leaders:\xa0 1. Face Reality\xa0 2. Lay A Strong Foundation\xa0 3. Act Like an Adult\xa0 \xa0 1. Face Reality:\xa0  You’re not that hot.\xa0 You don’t know far more than you know\xa0  You need to grow in:\xa0    Institutional knowledge\xa0 Technical knowledge\xa0 Relational\xa0knowledge\xa0     You have an incredible opportunity\xa0  Young People have: Energy, Ambition, Time 2. Lay a Strong Foundation:\xa0 What is your vision for your career? Which values guide you in your career? What is Your Edge? What do others say you do well?\xa0 Questions to ask yourself:  What are the top one to three assignments, projects, or achievements I need in order to develop expertise and my track record? The top one to three key skills or knowledge I need to acquire? The top five mentors, industry leaders, functional experts, and other key people I need to know, and who I don’t know now? Any specific formal education and training that will help me achieve my career vision  3. Act like an Adult  Be patient\xa0  Don’t be in a hurry. Build your career, consistently improve your technical and people skills.  Be useful  Finish your work, then look to help others with their work. Start with your department, then branch out to the rest of your company.  Don’t be jealous\xa0  Be happy when others in your company do well. Find out why they succeeded, imitate them and seek to help them to greater heights.  Don’t boast\xa0  Allow the quality of your work to speak for itself.  Don’t get a fat head  Don’t allow success to inflate your ego, but always be thinking what you can do to improve, and increase your contribution and impact.  Adapt yourself to others  Study how others prefer to communicate, how they like to work and ask yourself: “How can I adapt myself to contribute to their success?”  Stop worrying about a raise or promotion\xa0  Good help is hard to find. Focus on being\xa0good\xa0help.\xa0Perks,\xa0raises, promotions will follow.  Don’t get offended  You’re not in college or high school anymore. In the real-world people have different opinions, perspectives and lifestyles, get used to it.  Don’t keep track of offenses  In any\xa0career\xa0you’ll get screwed, passed over,\xa0dissed. Don’t keep track of it. Just keep working, doing your best, making a contribution.  Help others when they fail  Don’t be happy when others fail. Try and help them recover. Maybe they’ll be there to help you through your failures.  Recognize others\xa0  Notice people excelling, specifically and sincerely praise them and tell others about their efforts.  Don’t gossip  You’ll hear and see stuff. You’ll be tempted to join in the water cooler talk. That’s a waste of time.\xa0  Be Brave\xa0  Hold people accountable. Have difficult, face to face conversations.\xa0  Be generous\xa0  With your time and resources.\xa0 \xa0 Next steps:\xa0 Get your copy of the Construction Leaders Dashboard and use it to clarify how you are going to become a successful leader. This is what one of my clients, Chris Barkley, Director of Field Operations, at Teichert Construction says about the Construction Leaders Dashboard:\xa0  The structure of Eric’s coaching process has been beneficial. Our business ramps up in the summer, and when things are going crazy, our guys keep our field operations running smoothly. They tell me that using the Construction Leaders Dashboard framework that Eric introduced to them has been awesome because they’ve been able to put pen to paper, clarify their personal goals, and relate them to their leadership responsibilities and Teichert’s objectives. It’s helped to simplify their focus and anchor them back into what they’ve committed to accomplishing this season.

Adapt them to your company and use them when you are hiring or promoting young people into leadership roles. \xa0 During the Great Recession, from April 2006 to January 2011, nearly 2.3 million construction jobs were wiped out. One of the long-term consequences of the downturn includes a void created in field and office leadership. Today, Emerging Leaders are about ten years younger than leaders typically are when they take on senior leadership roles and responsibilities. So it's essential that you are selective when you're bringing people into those roles. \xa0 Every great football franchise has a high impact head coach. Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots today, and Bill Walsh of the San Francisco Forty-Niners in the 1980s are two that spring to mind. \xa0 If you lead a construction company or a construction division or a department, think of yourself as the head coach, and when you promote into young people into leadership roles, you need to provide them with coaching. \xa0 Here's a simple process you can use:  Help them to understand themselves by taking a quality assessment (I use the ProfileXT with my clients). Use a 360 to help them to see how others perceive them. An easy way to do this is to have an outside party contact their peers, direct reports, boss, and even people outside of the organization and ask three questions:  What are the things that the emerging leader does best?\xa0 What is one thing that the emerging leader can do better? What other advice do you have to help the emerging leader be more successful and perform better?   Provide them a tool to help them describe how they're going to thrive in their leadership role. Have them sit down with pen to paper and jot down what they need to accomplish to succeed Meet with them regularly one-on-one to discuss their wins, challenges, and action items, so they make consistent progress  \xa0 You're responsible for developing and retaining the talent that drives your financial results. You don't always have the bandwidth to coach each emerging leader individually. It may benefit you at times to get outside help. If you decide to bring in an external coach, make sure that they check these three boxes:  They have to have deep experience working with construction companies and understand the game of construction. They fit with the values and the culture of your organization. They're a personal fit with the Emerging Leader.  \xa0 This episode is brought to you by the Construction Leaders Dashboard The Construction Leaders Dashboard is one of the simplest and yet most powerful tools for leaders in construction companies of all sizes that can be used to clarify what you need to focus on to be a highly successful leader.

They are having a question and answer session to give us an idea of what is working in their companies.\xa0 Paul owns Augusta Rental Homes in Augusta, Georgia, and they manage single-family and multifamily units. He got into real estate to flip houses, but he ended up with some rental homes and has now been in the property management business for about four years.\xa0 Brad and Paul discuss new acquisitions, the issues that can arise and how to stay on top of it all, and what happens if you don't. They talk about Paul's owner first philosophy, leasing fees, self-assist property showing, and some great things he has implemented in the last 12 months. You don't want to miss this episode; they have some good ideas that might give you a more profitable business.  Show Notes \xa0 [03:43] Welcome to the show, Paul Rush. [03:46] Paul tells us a little about himself and his business. [05:52] He speaks about his owner first philosophy. [08:15] Brad chats about some of the ways his company takes care of the owners they represent. [09:13] Paul gives us examples of how keeping the owner happy keeps them in business. [11:02] They discuss leasing fees and how they try to get the tenants to renew. [14:30] Paul tells us another example of how his philosophy works. [17:23] What challenges do you have right now in your business? [18:45] They talk about some issues that Paul is having with a property management company that he just acquired. [21:29] Integrating the new company into their system ended up being an issue, their timing was off, and rumors started before they could get out in front of it. [26:25] They discuss having the old property manager introduce the new one to alleviate any questions the property owners might have. [29:38] Have you ever had a company you wanted to buy fall into your lap? [33:02] Paul had another challenge when he kept some of the employees from the old company. [35:33] He talks about the one on one training he gave them to get them up to date with the software he uses. [38:32] Give us one great shining star thing that you have implemented in the last 12 months? [41:47] Brad's company is considering waiving a lease preparation fee to get more people to do self assist property showings instead of using agents. [43:21] Paul says that his company has never paid a commission to an agent to show properties they are all self-assist. [47:31] Would you pay a fee to hold a property for a few days until all of the paperwork was complete? [50:12] Paul tells his team to keep up the excellent work he is pleased with what they are doing.

Today’s guest is Scott Brady and they will be talking about the top 10 mistakes that could have been or may have been made by property managers. Scott goes through each of these items and gives some great dialogue on how not to make those same mistakes, there are some really great nuggets of information here that you don’t want to miss. Scott is going to be a facilitator and instructor at the Property Management Mastermind Conference in March 2020. He will be starting the conference with his SWOT analysis instruction piece, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Scott has taught this at the collegiate level and will be able to teach it at the conference level, this is all on the first day of the conference so make sure to purchase your ticket as soon as possible. Scott has a property management company in Southern California and has been in the industry since 2012, and manages 1200 doors. He says he is a student of this industry it fascinates him, both the opportunities and weaknesses, he teaches the top 10 mistakes because he has made these mistakes. Listen in to this conversation and see if there are some mistakes you can relate to or if you can learn from others who have made them. \xa0 Show Notes [02:53] Brad introduces Scott Brady. [03:33] Scott tells us about himself and what he will be teaching at the conference. [05:30] There will be 2 hours of mastermind sessions the first day of the conference. [05:55] Here are the top 10 mistakes and how not to make them, in no particular order. [06:32] Don’t pick a price, pick a strategy, they charge a flat fee and a percent of rent collected. [12:24] Don’t take just any client that comes in the door, are they your perfect customer? [18:00] If you don’t solve your owner pain points you don’t have value with the relationship, it's the right thing to do. [24:33] Not taking advantage of the local real estate community, get the local agents to refer their clients to you. [27:10] Brad talks about the  Business Development Mastermind Seminar in Atlanta in January 2020 that Property Management Mastermind is putting on and Scott is speaking. [30:18] You have to be completely transparent in this industry, make sure your website has updated information, contract and pricing. [35:28] Direct mail with transparency is very valuable but you must manage your expectations. [38:39] Taking no risk in a mistake, you must take risks to get ahead, you won’t always get it right but you must take risks. [43:31] Get out of the business and work on the business, you will be able to look more strategically at your business. [47:15] Don’t help other people get rich without getting rich yourself, sell every property that you manage, buy one property per year at least create assets, that is what will make you rich. [51:55] Improve your business, go to conferences, syndicate or implement programs. Invest in your business with your time by learning what your strengths and weaknesses are. [54:15] Brad tells us about implementation day at the conference, he wants people to come out of the conference with a call to action list. [55:20] Scott says that he wants everyone to look at their businesses differently, make changes now to see big differences in the future. \xa0 Links and Resources: Property Management Mastermind Property Management Mastermind Group on Facebook adisarro@sccombank.com (619) 988-6708 (Allison DiSarro from Seacoast Commerce Bank) Seacoast Commerce Bank Insurance Management Group (918) 728 8992 (Derek Scott with Insurance Management Group) zInspector FilterEasy Property Meld Richard Drake  NARPM Southern States Conference National Apartment Association  NARPM Accounting Standards Kevin on LinkedIn \xa0 For the Property Management Mastermind Conference information https://pmmcon.com/ \xa0 For the Business Development Mastermind Seminar  https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bbc-business-development-mastermind-tickets-70402370385 Bizdevmastermind.com | Welcome to the show!

Do you sell the agency and part ways? Can you negotiate an agency partner buyout? It happens - partners drift apart or sometimes people simply want out. Dealing with a partner break-up doesn\'t have to impact your agency\'s growth if you don\'t want it to. In fact, you can negotiate a fair buyout by facing it head-on or by being proactive. It\'s a tough conversation but definitely one to have earlier than later. In today\'s episode, we\'ll cover:  #1 source of digital agency leads. The best way to approach a bad partnership. 4 steps to an agency partner buyout.  Today, I talked with Dan Altenbernd, Co-founder of H2M,\xa0which is his digital marketing agency in Fargo,\xa0Minnesota. Dan has over 18 years of experience in the industry, and he\'s been building brands in his hometown for years. Not only is Dan\'s agency booming, but he started it with one more partner than he has now. When his partner didn\'t have the same goals as him, they negotiated a buyout and he\'s on the show to share that wisdom. #1 Source of Digital Agency Leads We all know agency growth is both the biggest goal and the biggest barrier for most agencies. We all want to grow. And how do you grow? With a lead generation system that keeps your pipeline full. The lead war always seems to be between outbound and inbound. Should you be reaching out to them or should they be coming to you? And actually, I don\'t think there is one right answer -- in fact, I preached a 3-channel approach to lead generation. I\'ve seen agencies win with outbound. And I\'ve seen agencies win with inbound. Your agency needs both, as well as strategic partnerships, in order to stay successful. But, here\'s the thing — neither inbound nor outbound is the easiest source of leads. You know all of those relationships that you\'ve been cultivating throughout your career? Those are an amazing source of leads. Former colleagues and co-workers are all low-hanging fruit. Many agency owners think they need 1,000 leads a day to grow big. You don\'t. You really only need a few. And your network can be those few leads that end up catapulting your agency into 7 figures. Dan says this is especially important for newer agencies with lean budgets. Rather than spending a ton on Facebook ads, get out there and leverage the connections you already have. Once you have your first few clients, you can start implementing other killer inbound strategies you\'ve been thinking about. The Best Way to Approach a Bad Partnership There are plenty of agencies that have amazing partnerships that just work. But, let\'s be real. No one will always want exactly the same things as you at exactly the same time as you, right? Eventually, you or your partner will outgrow each other or the business. Maybe your partner doesn\'t have the same ambitions as you, has different views, or simply wants out. Then what? I always say, you either know the bad partner or you are the bad partner. But as Dan explained, it doesn\'t have to be an ugly break-up. You just need to have an honest conversation with your business partner. If you think you\'re headed in the wrong direction, let them know. Don\'t be scared to start the conversation. If a change needs to happen, rip off the band-aid, and get it done sooner than later for the sake of your business and your own well-being. 4 Steps to an Agency Partner Buyout  Put it out there. Be upfront and honest with them. If you avoid the conversation for too long, it will be too difficult. It\'s better to face the confrontation and try to move forward.\xa0You might be surprised at the result! Dan simply pulled his partner into a room and told him it wasn\'t working - and his partner understood.  Once it comes time to actually create the exit plan for your partner, hire an outside consultant to help mediate conversations and negotiations. Emotions and egos can get in the way of an agency partner buyout. You\'re both entrepreneurs and you\'re both going to want to win the negotiations. Allowing a third-party to make the deal is the best way to keep things amicable.  Give your agency team time to process. Don\'t let your partnership break-up impact the team or get in the way of the great work you\'re doing. Communicate the new vision for the agency so the team knows and understands the direction and what things will look like without the partner.\xa0  While you want to be direct with the conversation, don\'t be hasting with the exit plan. That way, there\'s plenty of time to phase one partner out without impacting agency processes.\xa0Dan\'s entire buyout took place over the course of 5 years!  | Would you like to master inbound marketing with killer content? Would you like your agency to generate more leads without working harder to find them? Generating more traffic and engagement is the key. And it\'s doing better is easier than you think when you address the right two audiences. With some strategy you can win at the content game and land your digital agency more inbound leads an ever. In today\'s episode, we\'ll cover:  Two audiences every digital agency needs to create content for. Why the agency owner should be the face of the agency. How your digital agency can increase blog site traffic.  Today, I talked with\xa0Kieran Flanagan — VP of Marketing for HubSpot. Not only did Kieran help HubSpot grow into an international marketing goliath, but he\'s also partially responsible for growing their freemium business. We all know HubSpot is a big deal in marketing but, did you know 100% of HubSpot\'s customers come from the demand created by the marketing team? Kieran\'s on the show today to share with us the two audiences his team focuses on and why your agency should too. Two Audiences Every Digital Agency Needs to Create Content For How do you satisfy the mental cravings of clients and forge emotional connections with them? HubSpot breaks their marketing department into two teams — Mind and Heart. So, the Mind team is responsible for tactical content such as blog posts. The team figures out what people are searching and\xa0creates content around questions, concerns, and keywords based on SEO demand. The Heart team is responsible for emotional creative, like\xa0videos and audio content. You know, the stuff that pulls at entertains or creates connections. This type of content makes people feel that working with your business will solve their problem or ease their pain point. Here\'s what\'s great:\xa0 Each team has its own content calendar, and they act independently. This way, both types of content gets full focus, and HubSpot knows it\'s churning out both types of content regularly. Why the Agency Owner Should Be the Face of the Agency What do VaynerMedia, Apple, and Microsoft all have in common? They all have an owner who represents the brand! You need to be the face of your agency. Now, I know that can be scary sounding. Many agency owners feel being the face of their agency is too time-consuming, but it doesn\'t have to be! You set the methodology. Yes -\xa0you be a leader. And no, you don\'t have to hustle 24/7. It can be as simple or as complicated as you want. As always, stop doing the things you suck at\xa0and nail your strengths. As an Agency CEO, you have 5 roles in the agency and being the front-face of the company is #1. How Your Digital Agency Can Increase Blog Site Traffic As most everyone knows, HubSpot has some fantastic blogging tips. They do  pillar and cluster model\xa0for their posts, including marketing funnel diagrams and spend tons of time and resources on the HubSpot blog. So, obviously they have some phenomenal blogging tips, right? Here it is... drumroll please... you have to have a reason to write blogs. Wait! Before you roll your eyes, think about it. Does your agency really have a reason to create your blogs? Are you just writing "10 Reasons to Hire a Digital Marketing Agency" style blog posts (which are so clearly just cushy soft sales pitches)? Your prospects aren\'t stupid - they see right through that stuff. Your blog posts don\'t capture the heart or the mind of your prospects. When HubSpot writes "Best Marketing Hacks of 2019" their content isn\'t just ranking. They\'re accomplishing their mission, too. They sell marketing software and their mission is to help marketers with solutions to make their jobs easier. That blog post both ranks and it furthers their mission and it caters to a specific audience with a beneficial outcome. So -- If you sell agency services to lawyers, don\'t write "10 reasons you need a digital marketing agency." Instead, write a post titled "10 Ways to Get Quality Law Leads for your Law Practice" and see what difference it makes. | We\'ve all seen tech companies explode in popularity and valuation. How can your digital agency get a piece a sweet tech venture? Check out how one agency owner is out there successfully building technology and simultaneously running a digital marketing agency -- and crushing it at both. In today\'s episode, we\'ll cover:  How to build technology at your digital agency. One unique method to create tons of internal content. #1 growth tip for new agency owners.  Today, I talked with\xa0Bhanuka Harischandra, Founder and CEO of Surge.Global — a digital marketing and tech agency in Sri Lanka.\xa0Bhanuka\'s agency does everything from video to mobile to content and even SEO... but they also build tech. So, while half of Surge Global is helping businesses scale with marketing, the other half is scaling tech projects and creating tech companies.\xa0Bhanuka is here to tell us how to build tech at your agency and use it to grow and scale your business. How to Successfully Build Technology at Your Digital Agency Tech revenue is tempting,\xa0am I right? We see these tech startups with 5 employees that scale to $500 million in a few years and it\'s mind-blowing. So, as an entrepreneur, you may be trying to balance your desire to chase tech with your love for agency work. Guess what? You don\'t have to decide between them. Instead, you can build tech and build your agency at the same time. It\'s all about keeping a balance. Bhanuka\'s advice is to hire two separate teams. Your agency team should not develop tech projects. You need a separate R&D team to help build external and internal tech projects. You can even create an incubator. Hire some developers to work on different projects, see which ones take off, and then scale the winners up.\xa0Bhanuka transitions R&D teams with great products into their own business and his agency remains a shareholder. It helps keep everyone focused on their unique task. One Unique Method to Create Tons of Internal Content Creating internal content can be\xa0a serious pain for agency owners. Here\'s the thing\xa0— it\'s super necessary to have internal content for your team to rally around.\xa0You probably have access to some great content creators; they just need a little motivation. Bhanuka got his team to produce over 700 pieces of content in 30 days by gamifying content creation. He built an app and made a contest out of creating content. The team member who created the most content within a month would win $500. Second and third places were promised monetary prizes, too. And he compared everyone on a leaderboard to the team could view results in real-time. In the end, Surge only paid out $800 for 700 pieces of content. That\'s what I call a bargain! Here\'s what\'s awesome —\xa0Surge now has the app they developed out for other clients to use. (You can check out the app at Rallied.io) #1 Growth Tip for New Agency Owners It\'s been nearly unanimous from my podcast guests. The #1 piece of advice is learning to say no. But, it\'s about more than just saying no... It\'s knowing how to prioritize and say no to the wrong things so you can say yes to the right things. Even Bhanuka admits his agency almost went under by saying yes to the wrong things. He says always vet your prospects before they become clients and determine:  Are they a good fit for your niche? Can you and your team get along with them? Are they a culture match with your agency? Will payment be received on time? Are they reliable and responsive? And, most of all, do they have realistic expectations (remember NBAT!)?  If the answer to any of these is no, then you need to say no to working with this prospect. | Every agency wants its team to work smarter and hustle harder. But, the smart agencies know the best way to get results is with the right incentive program. On today\'s show, we\'re featuring an employee incentive model that may change the way you think about salaries and bonuses, as well as culture. In today\'s episode, we\'ll cover:  5 reasons to share 50% of agency profits. Why agencies should only hire specialists One big employee compensation secret How to implement profit-sharing  Today, I talked with\xa0Tom Murray, Managing Director of Jump450 — a full-service marketing agency in Soho, NY. Tom\'s agency does something a little crazy... they give 50% of profits to its employees. He\'s on the show to share why and how this crazy strategy is actually growing the agency faster than ever. 5 Reasons to Share 50% of Agency Profits Giving away 50% of your profits may sound more like a nightmare than a strategy but the thing is — it can work. Better yet, the agency is also paying employees a competitive base salary! Sounds crazy right? Maybe. But, it has a bunch of benefits you\'re probably not even thinking about:  You\'ll get the best-of-the-best. Incentivizing your team with bonuses on 50% of the profit gives them insane salary potential. The best\xa0talent in the industry will flock to your agency for one simple reason — you pay more. Goodbye retention issues. Let\'s be honest. Your team isn\'t going to find better earning potential anywhere else if you\'re offering them a huge cut of\xa0revenue. You can cut the fluff. The amount of motivation that profit-sharing programs give employees is mind-boggling. Some of the roles you\'re currently utilizing (like project managers) may be able to be cut. This helps the agency stay lean and allows a cushion to share 50% of topline revenue. Everyone will be an\xa0ambassador. Giving your employees a direct stake in the agency will hype them up. It makes natural brand ambassadors for your agency. Clients know the team is motivated.\xa0Clients understand offering 50% to your team will get (and keep) them motivated. And that means clients rest assured the team is doing a great job at all times.  Why Agencies Must Only Hire Specialists When you need someone to do SEO work, don\'t just hire "someone" - hire an SEO expert. This may sound obvious, but most agencies aren\'t following this rule. Tons of agencies just hire generalists and train for the skill. Try it the other way around. If you pack your agency with people who are really good at one thing, everyone is going to be the best at their jobs. You can probably hire fewer people. And, best of all, your clients will get the best possible help. Struggling to convince talent to come onboard? Consider filling in the holes with hyper-specialized freelancers. One Big Employee Compensation Secret Are you ready for the big secret? For most employees, it\'s not all about the money. Your team has to show up every day for work. In fact, half their life is basically going to be spent there. So having the right atmosphere and breeding a good agency culture is crucial when it comes to motivating, inspiring, and engaging employees.\xa0Believe it or not, amazing culture is another way to compensate your team. So, you can bonus your team or offer a profit-sharing incentive, but if your culture is garbage, the team is not going to engage. When you start thinking about salary, think culture first. You can make your team happy by providing an amazing place to work (first) and then think about the compensation model and any bonus structure. How to Implement Profit-Sharing For smaller agencies, changing the salary structure is a breeze. But, if your agency has over 10 team members, it can be difficult to make a wide-reaching change. If you\'re just now considering a profit-sharing model, you\'ll need to spend time forecasting. The key is to build out data models and track cash flow before implementing a profit-sharing model, so you can be sure the agency can support it. In other words... it\'s tough but, it\'s definitely doable. Because -- your salary structure could be the one thing holding back your agency\'s success. | Having trouble getting your agency to the next level? Want to increase agency revenue but can\'t get beyond a plateau? Then it might be time to get a little uncomfortable and take some risks. If you really want to level-up your agency check out the big risk one agency took which yielded 4X revenue in just two years. In this episode, we\'ll cover:  3 hacks to help your agency level up and increase revenue. Why outbound will make your digital agency revenue soar. How to hire the right agency sales team.  Today, I talked with\xa0Chris Brencans, CMO at OnTheMap — a full-service digital marketing agency. Chris\'s agency does something that may sound a little strange. Half of the agency\'s team are salespeople. That\'s right! 50% of the approximately 70 people at the agency are involved in sales, and business is booming. OnTheMap\'s revenue has grown from $1 Million to $4 Million in the last 2 years by investing in its salespeople and taking some risks. Chris is on the show to share some tips with us. 3 Hacks Help Your Agency Level Up  Lean on your processes.\xa0If you don\'t have processes, you\'re driving the highway without cruise control, constantly speeding up and slowing down. Why make it harder on yourself? Once you build-out the right processes, you can take your foot off the gas and start working on other areas of your business. You shouldn\'t be spending a ton of your time on client work. Instead, build processes so you can work on the business rather than in it. Find the glaring problems.\xa0Here\'s the big secret — you already know what your biggest problems are. Chances are, everyone in your agency knows what they are. Ask your employees and be honest with yourself as you reflect on them. They may be hard to fix. But ignoring them is causing them to be bigger than necessary. Tackle your agency\'s problems because they are a roadblock to your growth. Take some risks! If you have processes in place (#1) and you don\'t have any big problems (#2), then you\'re not taking enough risks. And, your reservations are what\'s holding back your agency\'s growth. Take a leap - bet on your agency! Organic growth still requires money, time, and resources. Be willing to spend them. (Like Chris\'s agency -- their big leap was betting on their sales team and poof! 4x growth in 2 years.)  Why Outbound Will Make Your Digital Agency Revenue Soar Inbound marketing keeps you successful. But it\'s outbound marketing which makes you successful. Chris\'s agency is 50% salespeople. They bet big on outbound, and it grew them from $1m to $4m. This isn\'t a one-off tactic.\xa0Neil Patel uses outbound to grow his agency, and I had one agency on the podcast who\xa0has grown to $6m in 2 years tackling outbound. Outbound just works. You can execute it on a lean budget. There are tons of killer strategies to follow. And it\'s easy to get started. You don\'t need half of your team in sales, like Chris. It just depends on your specific processes. But you definitely need one person, or a few, dedicated to sales. How to Hire the Right Agency Sales Team Attracting salespeople is all about salary, benefits, and culture. Selecting the right candidate(s)\xa0is all about these 3 things.  Look for initiative. You want to give your salespeople some formal training, sure. But you should be able to hand them processes and let them run with it. This team is going to be handling valuable leads. Make sure you give them some room to prove themselves. I believe salespeople prove their worth in their first 60 days. If they aren\'t cutting it.... you know what you have to do. Find the right soft skills. They say good salespeople aren\'t made; they\'re born. That\'s sort of true. Amazing salespeople need the right soft skills. Look for empathy, leadership, and resolve. You want a team of great communicators. Always hire for soft skills first. You can train the rest of the skill sets but personality either works with your culture or it doesn\'t. Seek an eagerness to constantly improve. You want a team that\'s always looking to do better than last month. Do they set their own goals? Do they take constructive feedback? Make sure their hungry and eager to be successful.  | Are you struggling to capture those big fish clients? Does it feel like your agency is constantly battling for every account? We\'ve all been there! You\'ve still got some growing pains. But, what if you could skip those growing pains and go right to be big leagues? Here\'s how one agency owner made his first client Kobe Bryant. In today\'s episode, we\'ll cover:  How to score big agency clients. 3 reasons your agency should hire some freelancers. #1 way for digital agencies\xa0to stay competitive.  Today, I talked with\xa0David Brickley, CEO of STN Digital and Host of The Business Of\xa0Social podcast. We all have our own unique origin story but, David\'s story is downright crazy. Not only did he score one of\xa0the biggest names in sports (Kobe Bryant!) as his very first client — he continues to work with some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment. James Harden, Shaq, Amazon, UFC, the Olympics, and even movie stars are his bread-and-butter. David\'s here to share his story about how you can grow your agency event while you\'re a small or mid-sized shop. How to Score Big Agency Clients What if I told you that David convinced Kobe Bryant to be his first client through a cold email?\xa0It\'s true! And, there\'s a lot we can all learn from that... Scoring your first big client is all about taking chances. Get out there and chase them - because why couldn\'t it be you? Forget about sticking to inbound and waiting for them to knock on your door. If there\'s something you want bad enough, get out there and chase it. And you know as well as I do — it only takes one big client to completely change the course of your agency. Once you have a big name or a big brand, you can leverage them to get other big clients. It\'s the domino effect. And, winning with outbound doesn\'t require a big budget\xa0-\xa0it\'s all about the grind. 3 Reasons Your Agency Should\xa0Hire Some Freelancers Don\'t worry - you don\'t need a huge team to serve big clients, you may just need to add some freelancers. The gig economy is in full swing. You can talented and highly skilled freelancers to work on a project basis. And here\'s why:  Freelancers give you tons of flexibility. You don\'t have to worry about onboarding for each unique client need. If your\xa0next client needs a little camera work done, you don\'t have to go out and hire someone for the\xa0one job. You can pay someone by-the-hour, and you never have to make a commitment. Freelancers give you scale. What happens once you get your first big client? Do you have a team ready to handle their projects? If not, you\'ve got an unlimited number of freelancers ready to tackle that project. Freelancers are cost-effective. Does it really make sense to hire a full-time writer for 40 hrs a week to create\xa0a few blog posts? Do you really need a full-time animator? Freelancers allow the flexibility to pay-as-you-go\xa0on a project basis, without the overhead of full-time employees.  #1 Way For Digital Agencies\xa0to Stay Competitive Every year, hundreds of agencies close their doors for good... and for most of them it\'s not intentional, but rather the result of lacking one basic thing. They didn\'t adapt. The algorithms keep changing and what worked last week or last month or last year isn\'t cutting it. For example, EO isn\'t the same this year as last year. And, it could be wildly different next year. Digital agencies have to be flexible and they need to be constantly innovating. If you aren\'t creating bigger, better, and more interesting things, you\'re headed down a dangerous road. You can\'t keep performing the same old tricks; you must keep things new and evolve to the needs of your audience. Client retention isn\'t all about wooing them (although the right gifts don\'t hurt!) It\'s about providing them value with innovative solutions they can\'t find with anyone else. | Creating video content is hard, right? It\'s got to be perfect lighting, sound, and of course relevant subject matter. Don\'t let all that overwhelm stands in your way of getting started. Video content is one of the hottest ways to attract new agency business. And, anyone can make incredible videos without a ton of experience - you just need to get out of your own way in order to get started. In today\'s episode, we\'ll cover:  How to start making video content for your agency. 3 easy video types to help get you started. #1 tip for creating engaging video content.  Today, I talked with\xa0Chris Deblasio, actor, producer, and CEO of Agency850,\xa0the entertainment marketing company he founded. Chris\'s agency shoots Hollywood-quality videos and does product placement for movies and TV. Chris went from selling yellow page ads\xa0to running a successful video\xa0agency. And, he\'s learned a few tricks along the way. From being comfy in front of her camera to winning with video creatives, Chris explains how video marketing can add value to your agency\'s services. How to Start Making Video Content Chris makes high-quality videos at his agency but he\'s the first to admit you don\'t need fancy equipment to get the attention of your prospects. You don\'t need an expensive camera and a sound crew to produce outstanding videos -- just need your phone and a vision. Want to know the big secret to making great video content? Just start! The sooner you start, the sooner it will become second nature to you. Sure, you\'ll make some crappy videos in the beginning. But, you\'re never going to make really killer ones until you a few under your belt. No one is going to judge you by one or two stinky videos. Prospects will be looking at your entire body of content, not\xa0a few\xa0rough ones. The sooner you start, the sooner you can find your voice. And the sooner you can cash in on video marketing\xa0– which isn\'t going away anytime soon. 3 Easy Video Types to Help You Get Started Here are 3 super-easy video content types to get you started. All you\'ll need is a camera and a smile.  Q&A Show: A simple question/answer show is an easy way to throw your hat in the video content ring. All you have to do is sit in front of a camera and answer some questions. It will help you get comfortable being yourself in front of the camera, plus it will position you as a thought leader. Don\'t have any questions to answer? Research some in online communities like Quora. I did that when I first started  Swenk Today! Live Content: Facebook Live and other live social platforms make it almost too easy. No one expects live videos to be filled with high production quality. That gives you a good excuse to play around a little if you don\'t know what you\'re doing. Give people a tour of your office or host a live Q&A with your clients and team. Podcast:\xa0Yes, all agencies should have a podcast!\xa0Your podcasts can be video podcasts. And, it\'s low risk. Most people are watching for the audio. So, if you have poor production and lighting skills, no one is going to notice. Even better, if you keep the podcast going, you\'ll be able to look back on your first episode and see how far you\'ve come!\xa0Want a good laugh? Check out my first one which we now fondly refer to as my hostage video.  #1 Tip for Creating Engaging Video Content The number one tip for making videos is... drumroll, please... be yourself! Yes! I know it\'s corny but it\'s true. Viewers want you to be genuine; this is easily the most important thing you can do to be successful with video content. Besides, no one can replicate you or your personality. It\'s totally normal. Most people tend to get a little nervous when in front of a camera. When I first got in front of the camera, I looked like an Oompa Loompa :) Take off the mask. A fake persona is obvious and copying someone else -- like Gary Vee or Casey Neistat is disingenuous. Go ahead and be yourself\xa0and give people a chance to like you for you. \xa0 | Looking for a low-risk, high-result way to scale your agency? Want the flexibility to grow and scale at will? Freelancers are a great way to grab top talent in this gig economy. Using freelancers can help scale your agency faster and easier than bringing on permanent employees and the overhead that goes with them. But, the real key is knowing which roles to hand to freelancers and which roles you should not outsource. But, how about using freelancers as a core component of your workforce? I talk to an agency owner that uses both in-house employees and freelancers on almost every project. And it\'s helped him grow at the speed-of-light.  How to win with freelancers Which roles you should never outsource. What not to do with agency freelancers. 3 reasons smaller agencies win big.  Today, I talked with David Freund, Partner at Junto — a web design and content agency. David\'s agency doesn\'t just use freelancers on occasion... freelancers are a core component of his agency\'s growth strategy, with over 25 on his team. Vetting freelancers and leaning on them to deliver cost-effective results helps Junto stay competitive in the commoditized market. And, David\'s here to give us some tips on when and how to use freelancers the right way in order to grow your digital agency. How to Win With Freelancers Blending an in-house team with freelancers has a ton of benefits. Hiring a load of freelancers can help your agency go remote. And, it can definitely help you save on costs and onboarding headaches. But, the secret benefit is that it gives you insane flexibility to scale. With a core team of employees in place, you can hire and let-go freelancers at will. As your growth has ebbs and flows, your hybrid team of employees and freelancers has the flexibility to ebb and flow, as well. Need a new website designer? Hire a freelancer. Need fewer SEO specialists? Eliminate a few. With freelancers, you can grow and shrink at will. And, you don\'t have to worry about all of the junk that goes into hiring and firing. This gives you a huge advantage over your competitors who are stuck with less flexibility. Which Roles You Should Never Outsource As agency owners, the thought of outsourcing talent can be terrifying. Finding and vetting freelancers can be overwhelming. And, some freelancers can be unreliable or unpredictable unless. If you\'ve been burned before you might be scared to work with others in the future. But, here\'s the secret — Dave says you have to outsource the right roles. For starters, keep strategy and project/account managers in-house. Keeping these roles strictly for permanent employees gives you the quality control that is necessary to grow your business. The last thing you want is to lose your agency\'s standard or sacrifice its reputation. Having a key team of managers within your walls is the secret to keeping a high standard and reaping the benefits of the gig economy. Your account managers act as a liaison between the agency and the client. You can structure your agency to have account managers work with the freelancers. That leaves you in charge of the big picture. But, you don\'t have to manage ALL of these freelancers and in-house team members at the same time. What Not To Do With Agency Freelancers It can be tempting to hire some freelancers, send them work, and then you deliver the end product to the client. Basically, your agency is just playing the middleman and reaping the rewards. Sounds like a win-win, right? Nope! Your agency needs to hold the reigns. You must\xa0have the systems in place to facilitate freelancers success and deliver consistent results to your clients. If the end product is a representation of your agency\'s work you have to have control over it from start to finish. Your job is to provide your freelancers with the systems they need in order to succeed. And, you or someone within your agency needs to have the skillset to understand and oversee the work you\'re outsourcing to a freelancer. So for example, if you don\'t know anything about web design, don\'t just hire freelancers and hand over a finished website to the client. At the very least, your account manager should have an understanding of web design and work hand-in-hand with the freelancer. 3 Reasons Smaller Agencies Win Big Size doesn\'t matter - no, really! :) There\'s never been a better time to be a small or mid-sized agency. You can be nimble and agile with your clients, and you can be far more flexible than the bigger agencies. If or when prospects question your agency\'s size, use these benefits to spin the story in your favor:  Small agencies can leverage freelancers. Using freelancers for skilled roles helps cut costs and compete for big projects. Sure, big agencies could hire freelancers but, they usually don\'t. They have a huge in-house team. And, they\'re going to lean on that team to get jobs done in order to justify salaries. But, that additional overhead puts them at a pricing disadvantage. Your agency can do the job cheaper and deliver better value. You have access to an entire global network of talented professionals because you\'re not restricted to just a specific few employees. They\'re still flexible. The best thing about being a small agency is that you can flip-the-script at-will. Want to start adding new services? Go for it by bringing on a freelancer with that skill set. Thinking about some new processes or strategies? Sure! You can try out all your ideas without disrupting a massive ecosystem Despite size, small agencies can compete in a changing world. Smaller means you\'re not stuck. You have plenty of maneuverability to start adjusting to the new trends in marketing. There are plenty of new and interesting avenues to explore... chatbots,\xa0artificial intelligence and a bunch of other emerging technologies exist in sparse markets. And, you can start jumping into those markets immediately!  | Struggling to win new agency business in order to supercharge growth? Stuck working in the business and unable to step back in order to work on the business? Your role as an agency leader is always evolving as the agency grows. But your #1 job is being an amazing leader and giving your team the guidance and support they need. In this episode, we\'ll cover:  How to win new agency business by building relationships. #1 way to supercharge digital agency growth. 3 tips for being an amazing digital agency leader.  Today, I talked with Steve Weiss, Co-founder of MuteSix — a Facebook ad agency. Steve moved to Los Angeles, CA to do standup comedy and instead ended up creating a digital agency. Four years later and he is now running an 8-figure agency with over 130 employees! So, how does a comedian transition to a massively successful agency owner....?\xa0 "Did\xa0you ever hear the one about the wildly successful agency owner?" No? Then stick around as Steve shares his story of growth, including his top 3 tips for being a better agency leader :) How to Win New Agency Business By Building Relationships As agency owners, we always want to win the pitch and land new business. You get in the room with the prospect and you want to tell them you can handle anything. You\'re willing to do anything and be anything in order to win a pitch. But that never ends well, does it? In Steve\'s case, he uses humor (remember, he\'s a former standup comedian!) to his benefit... It\'s ok to tell a prospect you don\'t know how to do something. Be the authority in a specific niche - horizontal and/or vertical.\xa0 When they ask for something outside of your skillset, be honest or use humor like Steve. For example, he tells prospects that SEO is like "black magic" to him, but what he\'s really good at it Facebook ads. And, he tells them his agency crushes Facebook ads; there\'s no one better at Facebook ads. His honesty and a bit of humor builds trust and creates the foundation for a relationship. In fact, it can be the secret to winning the pitch. If you\'re candid with them, they\'re going to respect you more for it. We can all smell a sales pitch from a mile away. So can your prospects. When you start bragging, they know you\'re desperate for the sale. Be truthful, honest, and win business with ideal clients who appreciate who you are. They\'ll believe you when you tell them what you\'re actually good at. So, instead of trying to convince clients you\'re "full service" even though you aren\'t, think about flipping the script.\xa0Be honest with them. And, use that honesty to form a great relationship. #1 Way to Supercharge Digital Agency Growth Want to know the secret to accelerate digital agency growth? You can\'t do it alone ~ you need a team :)\xa0Empowering your team is one of the easiest ways to achieve fast growth. If you hired right, your team is filled with skill and talent. You want is to be the smartest person in the room. Hire people who are smarter and better than you are and reap the benefits of supercharging your agency\'s growth. Believe me, if I would have been the smartest person at my digital agency, we would have never gotten anywhere! Steve says to give your team some room to grow and dominate projects on their own. And, always put your team ahead of\xa0revenue. Clients come-and-go. Good team members don\'t. It\'s hard to find people who fit into your culture, understand your vision, and have the passion to create results on their own. Your team is\xa0your biggest asset so treat them as such. Being a leader isn\'t all about you, your agency, and your vision... It\'s about providing opportunity and a pathway for growth and fulfillment. When you\'re a great leader that alone can be fulfilling for you. It\'s a win-win. 3 Tips for Being an Amazing Digital Agency Leader 1. Lead by example. Don\'t tell your team how to win, show them how. As a digital agency owner, all eyes are on you. Yes, it can be stressful, but leading by example is a good way to empower your team. Recognize your team\'s strengths and make sure you\'re continually developing those, rather than focusing on their weaknesses. Let your team shine by showing them how to become even better. 2. Don\'t try to please everyone. Don\'t be the people pleaser. You have to know when to say no. And you should always be willing to bring up issues with your team. Try to be friendly and have fun with your team, for sure. But, at the end of the day, you still have to be respected as the leader and not just another guy or gal on the team. 3. Learn how to fire. You should never have to motivate an employee. It\'s ok to inspire them, but motivation needs to come from within. Share the vision with them to inspire. Show them how they\'re part of something bigger and how their role creates a residual effect on clients and your clients\' clients.\xa0 That\'s inspiring! But if you\'ve got someone who needs constant motivation, then it\'s probably time to fire them.\xa0It\'s not as hard as it sounds\xa0and eliminating dead weight will actually benefit the rest of the team and the overall culture. | Experts are sensing a downturn in the economy... But is your agency recession proof? So many variables go into a healthy agency. Maybe you should look at raising agency prices? Maybe your agency really needs to hire (or fire) to make yourself indispensable to clients? If the economy takes a hit, you have to know who to hire, who to fire, and the right way to price your services in order to survive. In today\'s episode, we\'ll cover:  How to grow in a recession. When should you raise your prices? 3 reasons clients love project managers. Is your agency business partner still the right fit?  \xa0 I had a great conversation with Scarlett Rosier, Co-founder of\xa0Rhyme and Reason Design. Scarlett is one of those "unicorns" who actually went to college\xa0and got a Masters in Advertising. (So many of us are accidental agency owners who just fell into the business!) Scarlett is put her skills to work as the Director of Operations at her agency for the past 10 years. She\'s here to talk about growing in a down economy, nailing your pricing, and the value in project managers. How to Recession Proof Your Agency Worried about a potentially volatile economy? Don\'t be! When the market goes down, your agency has an opportunity to go up. Here\'s the big secret — in-house marketing teams are usually the first cut. Cutting the in-house team, therefore, justifies agency costs for your clients. Brands still need marketing in a recession. But, they can usually save money by getting more help externally. Don\'t fear a recession; embrace it. If you survive the recession, you\'ll have a bunch of new clients and a reason to raise prices. And you need to raise prices in order to be profitable. When Should You Raise Your Prices? The simplest answer is this — whenever you can! You have to be able to justify a price increase with value. So, if your value has gone up over the past year, your prices should too. Let\'s say you\'ve hired two new people, learned a ton of tips and tricks, and you\'re even better at helping clients this year than you were last year. Your prices should reflect those improvements because your clients are benefitting from them. I recommend reviewing and raising prices at least once a year. You should constantly be improving, building better processes, learning new techniques and strategies. And that means you\'re giving clients more value year-over-year. Adjust your proposals to match the increased value. Plus, you probably give your employees a yearly raise based on performance, right? Your clients should be giving you one too! Think about it this way... If you have a heart attack, are you going to use the best surgeon or the cheapest one? Price your agency services to match your skill and you\'ll attract the ideal clients instead of the ones who just want a bargain. A price increase is the fastest and easiest way to grow your agency business. 3 Ways Project Managers Help Retain Clients Want to know what clients really want? They want relationships and regular communication. They want to feel assured they\'ve made the right decision to work with your agency. And that\'s where a great PM helps retain clients.  They\'re the client\'s trusted advisor. Your clients need someone to touch base with\xa0so they don\'t feel like they\'re in the dark. Clients have questions, ideas and business goals they want to talk about. A PM is their agency contact for listening, sharing, and connecting.  They are a single point of contact. No client wants to have to go through a new person every time they need something, and frankly allowing them to do that would cause massive problems anyhow. Project managers build client relationships, which brings tangible value to your agency. It\'s easier to make existing clients happy than constantly bringing on new ones, right? Happy clients make agencies giant.  Project managers attack pain points. Hiring an agency requires a leap of faith on the client\'s part. They don\'t know if they\'re going to get results, and they\'re spending money on potential value. Project managers can help ease those fears and avoid buyers remorse. A good PM will anticipate the client\'s fears and talk through them.  Is Your Agency Business Partner Still the Right Fit? Business partner relationships can be like a marriage. You rely on each other, and you know the day-to-day struggles the other faces. But, what happens when your marriage evolves or changes? But also like marriage, business partner "divorce" isn\'t easy. And the realization of its necessity something many owners grapple with. I have a saying — "You either know the bad partner or you are the bad partner."\xa0Sure, sometimes partnerships are successful,\xa0but oftentimes I see the partners outgrow each other. So how do you know when it\'s time to part ways with a business partner? It\'s all about communication and goals... Scarlett says to look at how the person argues as an indicator of their communication. Are they articulate? Can they stand their ground intelligently? You don\'t need to agree all the time, but being able to disagree effectively is what makes a great partnership. Rhyme and Reason was initially founded by three partners, but there came a time where one of them had different goals. That\'s when Scarlett realized there needed to be a shift in the agency\'s leadership. If a partner has career goals that don\'t align with yours and with the agency, it may be time to part ways.', 'chan_desc': 'Growing an agency is very difficult, and you might feel unclear what to do next in order to grow and scale your agency.

Patrick’s amazing story starts with his family immigrating to America when he was 10-years old.  His parents fled Iran as refugees during the Iranian revolution and were eventually granted U.S. citizenship. After high school Patrick joined the U.S. military and served in the 101st Airborne before starting a business career in the financial services industry.  After a tenure with a couple of traditional companies, he was inspired to launch PHP Agency Inc., an insurance sales, marketing and distribution company – and did so before he turned 30.  PHP is now one of the fastest growing companies in the financial marketplace. Patrick is passionate about shaping the next generation of leaders by teaching thought-provoking perspectives on entrepreneurship and disrupting the traditional approach to a career.  Patrick’s popularity surged and created a buzz in the hearts of entrepreneurs all over the world when The Life of an Entrepreneur in 90 Seconds, a video he created, accumulated over 30 million views online (It became a book in June 2016: The Life of an Entrepreneur in 90 Pages ).

For two, they don’t line walls with Post-it notes. For three, they don’t do daily stand ups, design sprints, development sprints, or anything remotely tied to a metaphor that includes being tired and worn out at the end. No backlogs, no Kanban, no velocity tracking, none of that.What they do instead is six week product builds followed by two weeks of cooling. Their leadership team decides how long they want to spend on tasks vs working with product estimates and if they work isn't done, it's thrown out. Today we sit down with Ryan Singer and learn more about his most recent book Shape Up which outlines this process. Read the full book at http://basecamp.com/shapeup.

Notwithstanding prior suggestions that Microsoft’s investigation uncovered global conduct, Microsoft’s liability focused primarily on Microsoft’s conduct in Hungary. Even with the tailored settlement agreement, DOJ and the SEC reiterated robust expectations surrounding third-party distributor networks, particularly in the software industry. To resolve a lengthy six and one-half year investigation, Microsoft entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department and an administrative settlement with the SEC.

Lohrenz learned what Fearless Leadership means in two of the most demanding and extreme environments imaginable: the cockpit of an F-14 and the flight deck of an aircraft carrier. Through her experiences, Lohrenz identified a fundamental truth: high performing teams require fearless leaders. “Fearless leadership isn’t about not feeling fear. It’s having the ability to feel uncomfortable and to move through it and show up to be the best you can be,” explains Lohrenz. Hear her describe the fundamentals of Fearless Leadership:  Courage: If you cultivate courage in yourself, you’ll have what it takes to see limitless possibilities for yourself as a leader. Tenacity: Embracing the persistence it takes to keep going after a goal—even when it becomes difficult or risky—and continuing to take action. Integrity: Do the right thing, be honest, be trustworthy, and lead by example.  Lohrenz also describes how to put Fearless Leadership into action by first setting a clear vision, then being the catalyst for moving your team toward that vision by creating the culture to support it. She also illustrates the importance of being resilient as a leader and describes the seven steps you can take to become more resilient:   Reject victimhood Embrace change Focus on what matters Find a wingman Know what you can control Learn from adversity Take action   “Above all, Fearless Leadership is the difference between having the life, team, culture, and organization that you want, and settling,” says Lohrenz. So risk more, worry less, and take action—because bold, fearless action drives success. For more information about Carey Lohrenz, visit www.careylohrenz.com | In this episode, you’ll hear Jim Clifton describe the findings from Gallup’s largest study on the future of work from his new book, It’s the Manager. “We found that engagement—not satisfaction, but engagement, where people are developing and contributing to something bigger than themselves—is extremely low. In the United States, about 30 percent of employees are engaged at work. And if you look worldwide, that number drops to 15 percent,” says Clifton. “This tells us that in the world of management, something isn’t working. The numbers are depressing—but the possibilities are inspiring.” After studying 300,000 teams across 160 countries, Gallup found that one thing makes the difference between high performing teams and failing teams: the manager. While the world’s workplaces have been going through extraordinary change, the practice of management has been stuck in time for more than 30 years. Hear Clifton describe a few of the 52 discoveries from his book, including the importance of creating the kind of culture that supports employee development and the need for managers to stop being a boss and start being a coach. The new, younger workforce wants their work to have deep mission and purpose—and they don’t want old-style command-and-control bosses. They want coaches who inspire them, communicate with them frequently, and develop their strengths. “Just imagine if we improved engagement from 15 percent to 50 percent. We would see meaningful growth like never before.” About Jim Clifton For more information about Jim Clifton, visit www.gallup.com. | In this week’s podcast, you’ll hear Brendon Burchard explain why and how some people perform at a higher level than others. He identifies six habits successful people practice to sustain long-term achievement in their personal and professional lives.  Seek clarity. Successful people continually seek clarity. They are curious and ask questions. They are intentional about understanding how they are perceived by others and about the specific differences they want to make. Generate energy. So much mental, emotional, and spiritual fatigue exist today that we all must take control of our own energy. High performers develop routines such as meditation or other wellness practices to increase their energy throughout the day. They practice the exercise of releasing tension and they set their intentions before starting a project or activity. They create transitional moments to refuel their bodies and minds, and to increase creativity and focus. Raise necessity. High performers amp themselves up to do a good job. Before any situation, they define why it is important to excel, and they increase the psychological stress on themselves. They understand who and what they are performing for, and strive to be their best. Increase productivity. Focus is the key to increasing productivity. High performers don’t do something just so they can cross it off their list. They continuously determine the most important work they should be doing—and then they intentionally block out time for that work in order to achieve their most critical goals. Develop influence. High performers influence others by asking them to think about things differently and to challenge themselves. When you think about someone who influenced you, you’ll realize they probably challenged you in the same way. Demonstrate courage. Demonstrating courage doesn’t have to be a Herculean feat. Practical things done on a daily basis help people perform at higher levels. Speaking up for yourself, sharing your truth, and speaking up for others are all acts of courage.  As Burchard explains, “The things that matter most to your performance might seem like common sense, but they are not common practice. You must identify the things that make you extraordinary and align the right habits to help yourself become a higher achiever.” About Brendon Burchard For more information on Brendon Burchard, visit www.brendon.com \xa0 | For everyday situations that can drain our daily energy and make us lose focus, Micro-Resilience offers quick and easy ways to help us cope: Learn how to Refocus Your Brain, Reset Your Primitive Alarms, Reframe Your Attitude, Refresh Your Body, and Renew Your Spirit! Bonnie St. John explains how in her book Micro-Resilience, coauthored with Allen P. Haines. “We have so much disruption in our lives—new technology, new customers, new competition, new processes and systems,” says St. John. “All of this disruption creates stress and mental exhaustion. But you can make tiny changes in your daily routine to help you deal with the big changes going on in your life.” A lot of information is available about how to deal with big life changes such as illness or natural disasters. These kinds of events can require complex solutions and take time to work through. But for everyday situations that can drain our daily energy and make us lose focus, Micro-Resilience offers quick and easy ways to help us cope. | In this episode, S. Chris Edmonds discusses the key points of his book The Culture Engine: A Framework for Driving Results, Inspiring Your Employees, and Transforming Your Workplace. S. Chris Edmonds has a delightfully simple explanation of culture: “Culture is all about how people treat each other—how leaders treat their teams and peers, how employees treat each other, and how people treat customers and vendors. It’s about relationships and respect,” he explains. As simple as that sounds, it can also be a very disruptive concept to some organizations. Many leaders and managers are asked to manage business results but are rarely asked to manage the quality of their work culture. “Get out of the mindset that results are the most important thing. Make respect as important as results. One of the first things I do is educate senior leaders about how important it is to have a culture that is purposeful, positive, and productive—one that is going to drive great customer experiences and employee engagement.” So how does an organization start creating the culture they want to cultivate? Edmonds suggests writing an organizational constitution—a document that outlines the purpose, values, strategies, and goals of the company. It describes exactly how employees will engage with each other, with customers, and with vendors. An organizational constitution gives meaning and clarity to every employee by providing a clear understanding of how they can do their best work, treat others respectfully, and help the organization prosper. It is critical to urge all the leaders in the organization to model the behaviors outlined in the organizational constitution. It becomes the document they can lead by, live by, and manage performance to. It helps them hold people accountable, praise people who are living the values of the constitution, and redirect people whose behaviors are not in alignment. If your organization doesn’t have a constitution, individuals can lead by example. Edmonds asks leaders to pay attention to the relationships they have with their direct reports, peers, customers, and vendors. “I ask leaders to shift from an ‘I need’ mindset to a ‘What do you need?’ mindset. If leaders can help their people accomplish tasks easier, or give a client what they need, they will build trust and create a mutually beneficial relationship,” Edmonds explains. “I’ve seen it work with intact teams within organizations. \xa0I tell people to just start making a difference where they are.” Edmonds shares several examples of working with organizations to help them define their purpose, values, strategies, and goals, and describes how these companies are creating their desired cultures. The stories bring his concepts to life. Edmonds stresses that culture drives everything that happens in an organization day by day, including focus, priorities, and the treatment of employees and customers. A great culture not only drives great performance but also can help attract and retain top talent. However, a great culture isn't something that evolves naturally—it must be defined, supported, honored, and modeled every day.

Play to your distinctive strengths—Help team members identify what they are good at and let them apply their knowledge to those types of projects. Embrace your constraints—By identifying constraints and taking a hard look at them managers can help team members inspire innovation. Battle entitlement—Encourage team members to think about new ways of doing things. Just because a process has been in place for years, doesn’t mean it is the best process. Entitlement can kill innovation. Step back, down, or sideways to grow—Continually pushing forward is not always the best way to drive innovation. Help people understand the positive influence of stepping back to look at other possibilities. Give failure its due—Accept what you can learn from failure. It might be the very thing to catapult you up the learning curve. Be driven by discovery—Encourage your team to ask for feedback and use what they learn to discover things that might be holding them back.

Eurich explains how developing self-awareness—knowing who we are and how others see us—can help you be fulfilled, confident, and successful in life and work. “As an organizational psychologist—and intuitively—I’ve always believed that self-awareness was an important skill. But as an executive coach, I’ve come to realize it is an essential skill. I wanted proof, so I started researching the concept.” Eurich’s research shows that self-awareness is the foundation for high performance, smart choices, and lasting relationships. It also shows that most people don’t see themselves as clearly as they could. “Our data reveals that 95 percent of people believe they are self-aware, but the real number is 12 to 15 percent,” she says. “That means, on a good day, about 80 percent of people are lying about themselves—to themselves.” There are two parts to self-awareness: internal and external. Internal self-awareness means knowing your values and personality strengths and weaknesses. External self-awareness means knowing how other people see you. The two parts are independent of each other. A person can be high or low on both scales, or high on one and low on the other. Fortunately, self-awareness is a skill that can be developed—all it takes is a willingness to improve. Critical elements include questioning your assumptions about yourself and asking for feedback. Most people don’t like hearing feedback, but pushing past this discomfort is one of the first steps on the journey to self-awareness. Eurich identifies a phenomenon she calls cult of self as a global problem. “Think about the way people use social media. They don't post bad news—only great news. It can take so much effort to make ourselves seem a certain way that we become disconnected from who we really are,” she explains. “We each have a choice between being a meformer—just talking about ourselves, or an informer—focusing on what we do, how we can add value to the world, and what we learn from people around us.” Self-serving behavior shows up in the workplace when people are not authentic and not open to feedback. The most productive work environments, according to Eurich, are built around people being humble, open, honest, and willing to learn and grow. “A surprising finding centers on people who spend a lot of time in self-reflection. We assume they would be more self-aware, but it isn’t true. Some people spend so much time ruminating on the negative that it actually damages their self-awareness. The key to effective self-reflection is to think about something for a defined period of time and then make a decision, not to beat yourself up. For example, instead of focusing on why you may have done something, think about what you can do differently next time or what kind of support you need. Self-reflection should move you forward productively.” To apply this concept in the workplace, leaders must model self-awareness behaviors. First, ask for feedback from every member of the team. Create a safe environment for people to share their truth when giving feedback. Most important, make sure this is a continuous practice—not just an activity at a retreat. Eurich offers one last piece of advice. “Working on your self-awareness will put you ahead of 80 percent of your colleagues. It is the secret ingredient. Don’t put pressure on yourself to do it quickly—be open to what people tell you so that you can make a significant improvement.” About The Ken Blanchard Companies The Ken Blanchard Companies is the global leader in management training.

He explains that the most successful leaders not only know what to say and do, but are willing to experience the discomfort, risk, or uncertainty of saying and doing it. These leaders display what Bregman calls Emotional Courage. “Think about a conversation you need to have, but haven’t. You have all the skill and knowledge you need, but you aren’t doing it. Why? Most likely it is because you believe it may cause you to feel something you don’t want to feel. You might become disconnected from that person. Or they might come back in anger or act in a passive aggressive way that can damage relationships and put projects at risk. It could simply make you uncomfortable—and no one likes to feel uncomfortable. Emotional Courage is not how much you know—it is about what you are willing to feel,” says Bregman. The four elements of Emotional Courage are simple to understand, but not always easy to implement. To be a leader with Emotional Courage, you need to:  Be confident in yourself. To be confident, you need to understand who you are as a leader and then determine who you want to become. Asking for feedback is a powerful way to uncover blind spots, while listening to and accepting that feedback is the key to changing your behavior. Building confidence creates the foundation for your leadership style.   Be connected with others. Listening with a willingness to learn something new is the birthplace of connection. Following through on commitments builds trust for a lasting, honest relationship. True success depends on connecting with others.   Be committed to a purpose. Create a clear, powerful, compelling focus toward a larger purpose in order to channel your energy and the energy of those around you toward a common goal. Achieving a common purpose requires extreme focus.   Act with Emotional Courage. Understand when you don’t want to feel something and take steps toward it. Be courageous and act boldly. Emotional courage feeds on confidence, connections, and commitment.  “The key thing to remember is to be aware of what is important to you and be willing to take the risk to increase your own productivity. That will have a positive impact on personal and organizational results—because you will be operating with Emotional Courage.” About The Ken Blanchard Companies The Ken Blanchard Companies is the global leader in management training.

For public speakers there are many potential triggers for stress and anxiety… the actual act of speaking can be terrifying for some, then there’s the rejection to deal with, and perhaps one of the biggest ones we face…the old imposter syndrome. That’s why I decided to invite Linda Clarke on the show. I have been working with Linda to develop her new workshop and I’ve been so impressed by her story, her knowledge and experience and the results she gets people. So, for me it was a no brainer to ask if she would come onto The Speaking Club to share her wisdom with you. A Master Hypnotherapist, with many other qualifications to her name, Linda has been in practice since 2006. She was based in South Africa for most of that time, with a thriving business, even treating Nelson Mandela’s Granddaughter as part of a documentary at one point. But her life changed dramatically in 2017 and what would have sent most people over the edge, gave Linda the perfect opportunity to take her own medicine. I am sure you will enjoy this show! What we talk about:  What Hypnotherapy is and how it works. How your thoughts can help or hinder your situation when you’re going through a difficult time/transition. The top 3 things you can do to cope in a high-stress situation. The two different ways of being mindful and how they can help you perform better. Specific tips for managing anxiety and stress around public speaking. The importance of building the right neural pathways. Primal needs – what they are and why they matter. Why your talk doesn’t need to be perfect to be effective. Why you should speak to the audience you’ve got not the one you want. The importance of trusting your instincts in business.

That’s because if your audience can relate to and is captivated by your message, then they will be more likely to remember it, and be moved enough to take the action you want. To achieve this goal, you need to recognise that whilst every second of your talk counts, there are some moments that are critical for achieving that goal and successfully building the narrative of the journey you are taking your audience on. In this podcast I’m going to give you tips on identifying those big moments and making them count. Enjoy! What you’ll discover:  What ‘big moments’ are How you can find them The questions you need to ask when you find them A reminder of the performance tools you can use to help you bring these moments to life  Thanks for listening!

So does your audience, and in fact the majority of the population. Humour brings people together, builds a connection between you and your audience and is more likely to get your message shared. The trouble is that it can seem scary and hard to do in public speaking, and that is where this episode comes in. For most of my life I’ve worked in the corporate world by day, alongside doing stand-up comedy and theatre by night! During that time, I realised that the humour I used in the comedy clubs, was not going to be appropriate when speaking to audiences in my corporate job. The principles behind creating the humour were exactly the same but my brand and my audience were not. I know the power of comedy in both contexts and that’s why I’m so passionate about helping you use it in the right way to get results in your speaking generally, and your stories especially.\xa0 So, in this show I’m focusing exclusively on adding humour to stories rather than writing jokes for jokes sake. I’m going to be giving you five simple tips that you can use to make your stories funnier in a low risk way. Have fun and let me know how you get on!! What you’ll discover:  Why people laugh Why it always comes back to your audience How to get laughs from small details Why you need to channel your inner magician What you can learn from the film Evolution about making things funny The golden comedy formula A variation on the rule of three Things to be mindful of when using comedy  \xa0 Thanks for listening!

It was primarily about marketing and how to create an irresistible offer, but there were lots of golden nuggets that applied to speaking too! As you may know I coach and consult on marketing and speaking with a specific focus on storytelling and humour. That’s because I believe that the two are so closely linked AND as well as educating and motivating your audience speaking is also one of the best ways to market and sell your products and services. All of the speakers who were on stage at the conference were amazing and I was particularly chuffed to be able to see one of my marketing heroes in action. This guy is also one of the highest paid speakers in the world, so when he talks, I listen. He gave away many value bombs during his keynote including the one I’m going to be sharing with you today! Enjoy! What this episode covers:  Why frameworks are important How to make your audience engage with the framework before you even share it with them How the same teaching framework will enable you to flex your talk to fill five minutes or five hours! When you should stay at the strategy level and why. The one thing you should always do with your framework to get your audience motivated to implement what you’re sharing.  Thanks for listening!

That disease is ‘slide sickness’. The symptoms are nasty, and they result in the audiences for your talk slapping themselves in the face to stay awake. I know that what to do with slides pre-occupies and perplexes many speakers and since I’ve only touched on the topic of slides once before in a guest show, I’ve decided to go a bit deeper in this episode. I’m going to give you my take on the seven deadly slide sins and how to avoid them, so that you are confident about using slides and they won’t cause you problems again. Enjoy! What this episode covers:  Where slide creation comes in the preparation process Slide design and what you need to think about Why you need to think about what your audience can see How you can avoid unnecessarily breaking the audience connection What your slides say about you and your business How to avoid falling into the fun trap How your slides can support your success  Thanks for listening!

But therein lies a risk and an issue that has turned many potentially scintillating talks into snooze fests.\xa0 Depending on our experience as a speaker, the context in which we’re speaking and our own level of insecurities, there is sometimes an overwhelming desire to ‘prove’ ourselves and show how much we know.

Before Calendly, he was the Head of Product at Atlassian.   While Oji and I joked a lot about the enigmatic 10x product manager that came from Twitter memes, he also expressed how the role has gotten a bit mysterious.\xa0 We also discussed the human side of building software, and how to optimize customer calls.\xa0 | This week on Product Love, I sat down with Benjamin Earl Evans, inclusive design lead at AirBnB. In this episode, Ben discusses the importance of inclusive design, and the three types of bias that product managers tend to fall victim to. | In the past, when people heard the phrase “artificial intelligence”, they probably thought three things: robots, destruction, and the impending end of humankind. Nowadays, artificial intelligence has graduated to something more sophisticated and much less deprecating like self-driving cars, Amazon’s Alexa, and Apple’s Siri.\xa0 But there are wary feelings of replacement that are still associated with it. If AI automates everything, what happens to everyone else?  Deon Nicholas thinks differently. Instead, he asks us to think of AI as augmentation instead. This week on Product Love, I sat down with Deon, the CEO of Forethought to discuss AI, and his perspective on increasing product-market fit. | These days, it is unbelievable how easy it is to be distracted. Think about it. We have a nearly Pavlovian response to every Slack notification or every text message, or we’re attached to the “endless scroll” that social media platforms have now adopted. These products are so entwined with our daily habits, because they know how to hook you. In 2014, Nir Eyal released a book called “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” which essentially became every product person’s go-to book. He had researched a framework that would help anyone create products that would influence users. These days, he has a new book called “Indistractable” which focuses on how to avoid distractions from technology. The two might seem like they contradict each other, but they actually complement each other. This week on Product Love, I sat down with Nir Eyal to discuss his new book, what new technology means, and how to actually conduct good meetings.\xa0 | Bootstrapping. Pricing. Freemium.  Three words that incite fear in most product-minded people. But don’t close your tab just yet. This week on Product Love, I sat down with Patrick Campbell, who has managed to turn those three things into a pretty successful company called Profitwell.\xa0Profitwell is a company out of Boston that helps subscription companies achieve faster recurring revenue growth, by optimizing their pricing or helping them avoid churn.  In this week’s episode, Patrick shares what he’s learned in the past about bootstrapping, the ingredients to a winning pricing page, and he breaks down some freemium myths.\xa0 | Lewis Lin is a well-known product management author and career coach. He's written about acing PM interviews, getting into top tech companies, and his latest book is all about scaling your PM career.\xa0  Lin reveals the ESTEEM Method™: six magical competencies to move ahead in your PM career. He explains why they’re the most critical competencies and provides specific tips and tactics on what you could do to demonstrate your capabilities. | Product managers and business leaders often wax poetic about how they want to change the world with their products or ideas. It’s natural. As product managers, your mission is to obsess over a problem, and find a unique solution that impacts your customers. But how much of that impact are you responsible for? Radhika Dutt believes that you’re responsible for a lot more than you think. | Jeetu Patel has run every function of the business in his career. He’s done his stint in marketing, engineering, sales, and now, product. But the one thing in business that has fascinated him the most has been scale. Early in Jeetu’s career, he’d travel a lot and was constantly amazed to see certain companies that were famous in the United States, have the same level of recognition and impact in a completely different company. It inspired him to learn the global nature of the business, and how a company can transform its’ reach. This fascination led him to Box, a cloud content management company where he is currently the Chief Product Officer and Chief Strategy Officer. Box was essentially the same product that served 3 employees to 400,000 employees and 14 million customers. Having a product unique enough to span that incredible spectrum is a huge challenge for any product manager. All of those segments have different requirements, so how do you even begin to adjust those? It’s a great intellectual challenge to have, and one of the most rewarding ones in his career. This week on Product Love, I sat down with Jeetu Patel, to discuss important metrics, and how to build an effective product team. | There are a lot of different facets to product. From UX design to engineering to development, Melissa Perri has had a stint in them all. When you look at product with those three different approaches, you come up with a foundation on how to work with these teams. Melissa believes that you get a holistic systems approach to product management, and can evaluate the product for its’ feasibility, usability, pricing, and more. She’s had over a decade of product experience, and now she’s currently the CEO and Founder of ProduxLabs. ProduxLabs helps companies grow and transform their product management organizations. Other than helping companies scale their product orgs, Melissa is also the founder of the online school, The Product Institute. This week on Product Love, Melissa and I discuss how companies are undergoing product transformations, how PMs can better utilize data, and how PMs can better scale their career. | Manish Patel joins Product Love to talk about communication as the key trait for all product managers.

This week\'s episode of "The Financial Advisor\'s Advisor" launches a special two-part series on the topic.

In both parts of the series Elite Consulting Partners Founder and CEO Frank LaRosa analyzes the home office visit and discusses the essential ways to make the most out of the visit. | Real estate, in particular office space, has a big business impact from its financial implications on a company\'s P&L, to its influence on overall operations and the image a firm projects. In this episode of the "Financial Advisor\'s Advisor", Elite Consulting Partners CEO Frank LaRosa guides financial professionals step-by-step through making the right decisions in regards to real estate, including a discussion on rent versus own and other important factors to consider in order to maximize revenue per square foot. | There are many reasons why advisors choose to go independent\xa0with their practices. From greater autonomy over business operations to branding control and, in most cases, a definitive financial upside - the attractiveness of the independent model is undeniable. Going independent; however, is not a \'one size fits all\' solution and many advisors fail to ask themselves the tough questions that let them know if independence is right for them. In this episode of "The Financial Advisor\'s Advisor", Elite Consulting Partners CEO Frank LaRosa discusses the importance of understanding who you are and what you want for your business as key drivers in choosing independence and provides case studies of current advisors and teams he is working with to illustrate the analysis points every advisor or team should go through in making the decision to go independent. | The importance of being strategic and forward-thinking about your business is paramount to success. Getting down to fundamentals, there are few decisions a business owner will make more important to setting the stage for growth long-term than choosing their company name. In this episode of "The Financial Advisor\'s Advisor", Elite Consulting Partners CEO Frank LaRosa breaks down the essentials of a successful business naming process, outlining the five most common mistakes business owners make when deciding on the their company name and offering up strategic guidance on creating a business name which will foster future growth. | It\'s a subject being bantered about by many in the financial services industry - will Merrill Lynch leave protocol? The rumors have certainly intensified as Merrill\'s strategic moves - among them no longer recruiting experienced advisors and focusing on a salaried compensation program - certainly seem to indicate a change in direction. In this special \'Hot Mic\' Episode of "The Financial Advisor\'s Advisor", Elite Consulting Partners CEO Frank LaRosa lends his expertise and insight to the subject, offering up his opinion and providing focused guidance as to what advisors at Merrill should be considering during these more turbulent times at the firm. | Preparation is the key to most every successful endeavor and this certainly holds true when strategizing for your business and its future. It doesn\'t matter whether you are in financial services or another industry, understanding where your firm is now and where you want it to go provides the solid foundation upon which you will be able to achieve your long-term business goals. In this Episode of ‘The Financial Advisor\'s Advisor’ podcast, Elite Consulting Partners CEO Frank LaRosa challenges his listeners to \'act as if\' and guides them through the strategic thinking and mindset practices which will position their business now for optimal growth later. | Online presence, in particular your website, is more important than many advisors give it credit for. In fact, it is the lens through which your peers and clients will view and form opinions about your business and your brand. In the case of firms who are actively recruiting or looking to acquire practices, websites can have an even greater impact, in particular to the bottom line as it is usually the first point of reference a potential firm or advisor partner will use to conduct their research. In this episode of the \'Financial Advisor\'s Advisor\' Elite Consulting Partners CEO Frank LaRosa leads a discussion on the ways your website can impact your business and the do\'s and don\'ts of creating a successful website in the financial services industry. | Compliance for advisors gets trickier and trickier every day. No advisor is a compliance expert and many - unwittingly so - will find themselves in sticky situations which ultimately result in termination. The top priority for the firms when in comes to compliance issues with an advisor is protecting themselves, even when the advisor is unaware that they committed any transgressions. In this episode of the \'Financial Advisor\'s Advisor\', Part 2 of two-part series, Elite Consulting Partners CEO Frank LaRosa puts the advisor first and gives practical advice on compliance-related termination, breaking down the top ten situations advisors find themselves in that will most often result in termination so an advisor can protect themselves from making any pitfalls. | You may think it will never happen to you, but as more and more advisors are discovering, being terminated by your firm is becoming an unpleasant reality for many. In a time when advisors have become more outspoken about both their practices and their client needs, larger firms are retaliating with termination as a \'keep the status quo\' strategy. Alternatively, increased FINRA scrutiny has resulted in firms becoming more vigilant in their business practices and ultimately led to an increase in advisor terminations. In this episode of the \'Financial Advisor\'s Advisor\', which is\xa0Part 1 of a special two-part series, Elite Consulting Partners CEO Frank LaRosa outlines the 5 practical - and immediate strategies - an advisor needs to take if they are faced with the unfortunate situation of being terminated. | Regardless of the size of your advisory practice, defining your core values as an individual, professional, and a business can be a game changer. By understanding your core values, you essentially gift yourself\xa0 with a road map that gives structure to your practice, provides the guideposts for how you service your clients, and lends the framework to achieve personal long-term growth.\xa0 In this episode of the \'Financial Advisor\'s Advisor\' Elite Consulting Partners CEO Frank LaRosa takes you through the practical exercises and insightful processes which will guide you in defining your core values, thereby redefining your business for optimal performance at every level.', 'chan_desc': 'The Financial Advisor’s Advisor podcast was created by Elite Consulting Partners President and CEO Frank LaRosa to give guidance and advice on a host of different topics all centered around the financial advisor, RIA, and other practitioners.

Here at DaVita we care for each other with the same intensity with which we care for our patients. So in this episode, Dave speaks about why there is equal importance in how we get the results as what results we produce.“It’s easy to get caught up in the day to day, and say “I’ve got a job to do today”. But realizing that doing your job is taking time to listen. It is taking time to empathize. It is how you produce the results and not just the results you produce.

John has been a guest previously in episodes #229 and #280, talking about Dr. W. Edwards Deming, "The Red Bead Experiment," and more. Today, we talk about the book, how to find out of there is a "facade" of excellence, and why "fear makes good people do stupid things," as John says. What\'s a façade? "A\xa0false\xa0appearance that makes someone or something seem more pleasant or better than they really are." | http://www.leanblog.org/348\xa0Our guest today for Episode 348 is Cinnamon Dixon, Director Of Continuous Improvement at Cleveland Clinic. I interviewed her for the KaiNexus Continuous Improvement Podcast series and I\'m cross posting that interview here to give it more exposure.\xa0Our KaiNexus team members who were at the Lean Healthcare Transformation Summit in June were really impressed with Cinnamon\'s presentation on their "tiered huddle" process that\'s part of their Lean methodology. So, we asked her to do the podcast.\xa0You can a full transcript via the KaiNexus blog.\xa0I recently had a chance to visit Cleveland Clinic and I spent the morning observing their tiered huddles, so I\'ll be writing a blog post about that soon. Thanks to Cinnamon and Cleveland Clinic for being so willing to share!\xa0 | http://www.leanblog.org/347Our guest today for Episode 347 is Brad Parsons, the CEO of NEA Baptist, in Jonesboro, Arkansas. NEA Baptist is a 228-bed hospital and 140-provider medical group serving northeast Arkansas -- part of Baptist Memorial Health Care Corporation. Brad is also the co-author of the new book Creating an Effective Management System: Integrating Policy Deployment, TWI, and Kata. His co-authors have been guests on the podcast before -- Patrick Graupp and Skip Steward. In this episode, we\'ll talk about core themes from the book, including his role as the leader of their transformational efforts to implement and continue improving an effective management system -- something that\'s important for so many reasons. We\'ll also talk about "Process Behavior Charts" and his experience with Don Wheeler. | \xa0http://www.leanblog.org/346\xa0\xa0Joining me for Episode 346 of the podcast is Mark Ryan, a Transformation Coach and Lean Six Sigma Black Belt at Franciscan Health.\xa0Mark will be one of the hosts and facilitators at our upcoming "Kaizen Live!" site visit event at Franciscan St. Francis Health in Indianapolis. Only two spots remain, so register today if you\'d like to join us.\xa0As we talk about in the episode, Franciscan does much more than daily Kaizen. They\'ve built upon that foundation of staff engagement to add other Lean practices -- under the banner of what they call "Managing for Daily Improvement," or MDI. They use "strategy deployment" and other methods to align the organization in their goals and improvement efforts.\xa0I hope you enjoy the discussion, whether you are joining us in Indianapolis or not.\xa0 | \xa0http://www.leanblog.org/345\xa0 My guest for Episode #345 is Edward Niedermeyer, author of the book Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors. It\'s available now for pre-order at Amazon (with an August 20 release date).Ed is currently the Senior Editor of Mobility Technology at The Drive. He was previously the editor-in-chief for the site The Truth About Cars. He\'s also one of the hosts of the Autonocast podcast about autonomous vehicle technology.In the episode, Ed and I talk about his thoughts on Toyota as somebody who has covered the automotive industry for over a decade. While his book has a lot of interesting details and stories about Tesla and Elon Musk (for example, I learned that Elon was not a founder), we focus mainly on the failed relationship between Tesla and Toyota.We also touch on the dynamics that lead to somebody who criticizes a company being labeled a "hater." It\'s interesting, perhaps, because Ed and I both want Tesla to succeed. Constructive criticism shouldn\'t be interpreted as wanting an organization to fail -- and that sometimes happens to people inside of different organizations, as well.This is a long discussion, at about 75 minutes, but I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.\xa0 | http://www.leanblog.org/344Joining me for Episode #344 is\xa0David Reid, a mechanical engineer whose career has taken him from improvement work at Michelin Tire, to being a pastor, to now helping the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain improve through\xa0Lean\xa0and\xa0Kaizen\xa0practices and mindsets.I was really excited to see the cover story that was in the May 2019 issue of ISE Magazine (Industrial & Systems Engineering). The headline inside reads, “From lean modules to a lean mindset — Chick-ﬁl-A\'s success shows how leveraging your greatest asset speeds up cultural change.”In this episode, I get to ask David about some of the drivers for Lean at Chick-fil-A, which is already a high-growth company with many happy customers and employees.How do they influence the owner/operators of stores to embrace Lean and to engage every employee in continuous improvement? Why did they learn that a top-down engineering-driven model couldn\'t possibly drive enough improvement? How does a Facebook page enter the equation for employees (and note that using Facebook was an employee idea) instead of “building an app.”There are many great “nuggets” of wisdom here from David, pun absolutely intended. I hope you enjoy the episode! | My guest for Episode #343 of the podcast is Amanda Mewborn, an executive director of project management for Piedmont Health.I\'ve known Amanda through the Society for Health Systems and she\'s one of the very small number of people I know with both engineering and nursing degrees. She has a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering and an M.S. in Health Systems from Georgia Tech and a B.S. in nursing from Georgia State University.So, in today\'s episode, we talk about that interesting combination of skill sets and why she got a nursing degree. We also chat about her career in healthcare, along with some of the facility design and construction work she has been involved with. We also hear her thoughts on why it\'s important to have the engagement and involvement of front-line staff (and patients) in the design process.  | For links and more, go to http://www.leanblog.org/342My guest for Episode #342 of the podcast is\xa0Adam Ward, the author of\xa0Lean Design in Healthcare: A Journey to Improve Quality and Process of Care.Adam is an innovation process expert and independent advisor. He spent the first 12 years of his career designing cars for Honda and the next 12 years working with Fortune 500 companies to turn around their product development process. A resident Buckeye, he coaches students at\xa0Ohio State\'s MBOE program.In this episode, we discuss his early days at Honda and how he made a career transition into healthcare. We\'ll talk about the story behind his book and some of his experiences and practices that are transferrable — going from “simultaneous engineering” to “Lean design.” What are some of the most common failures? How can we coach leaders so they aren\'t giving just lip service to these methodologies? We discuss all of that and more… | http://www.leanblog.org/341My guest for Episode #341 of the podcast is Dr. Rob Hackett, an anaesthesiologist in Sydney, Australia. Rob has become known around the world for his role in what\'s now called the “Theatre Cap Challenge” — a method for improving communication and, thereby, improving patient safety and outcomes.As we talk about today, Rob had the idea of writing his name and role on his surgical cap with a sharpie. Eventually, he (and others) have gotten printed caps made as shown below in my LinkedIn post about our discussion (it has received 200,000 views and counting).As I wrote on LinkedIn, Rob has, unfortunately, been trolled, threatened, and bullied for this seemingly benign and obvious improvement idea — both in the workplace and online. It seems that outsiders to healthcare and those who are new to medicine find an idea like this to be obviously helpful, but those who have been in healthcare the longest struggle to accept it.I appreciate Rob\'s perspective that those who oppose this innovation, for whatever reason, probably aren\'t bad people — they just have a different view and, possibly, some old habits or cognitive biases that they are stuck in.The interview goes for over an hour. One thing I\'d like to do is produce a shorter audio piece that\'s more like an NPR news story. See below for a full transcript and for links, videos, and more.

We find comfort in things that we already understand. When things change too quickly, we tend to go back to the way things were. Change doesn\'t always feel good. It makes us uncomfortable, but it\'s essential because the world around us is ever-changing. Our fear of trying something new from what we\'re used to prevents us from growing and reaching our full potential. You can\'t always stay in your corner of the forest waiting for others to reach you. You have to go out and take the initiative sometimes. But how do you get comfortable with change? How do you get okay with being uncomfortable? Here\'s the thing, we\'ll never feel comfortable at all times. That\'s why we need to push our boundaries a little bit. John Johnson, an Employee Benefits Consultant at USI, is here to help you shift yourself into that discomfort zone. Today\'s episode focuses on helping you help yourself be more comfortable with being uncomfortable.

Step one is understanding some of the basic flaws that are most insidious and most debilitating.

Record-high stress and rock-bottom engagement show that pretty clearly. Across the board, workers are burnt out, disconnected and struggling to maintain work-life balance. Fortunately for employees, organizations and chief learning officers alike, there’s something that can be done. A culture of resilience is “a form of psychological immunity” and key to bouncing back from the inevitable effects of adversity, says Tim Mulligan, chief human resources officer at Seattle-based Vulcan, the umbrella company for a number of investments and projects created by late Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen. “It\'s our role as leaders in the business world to create an environment that is realigning conditions in a way that people are able to balance the stress level, be productive, to leave work every day knowing you got a lot of stuff done and to look forward to coming back to work the next day,” Tim said. In this episode of the Chief Learning Officer Podcast, we talk to Tim about Vulcan, the lessons he learned from twelve years at the San Diego Zoo as documented in his book “Roar: How to Build a Resilient Organization the World Famous San Diego Zoo Way” and how other companies can build a toolkit for resiliency.\xa0 Plus, co-hosts Mike Prokopeak and Ashley St. John talk with Tim about what a resilient leader looks like, why branding is so important in learning and development work and how simple, catchy phrases can be the difference between a good program and a great one. Podcast Producer: Jesse McQuarters Book: Roar: How to Build a Resilient Organization the World Famous San Diego Zoo Way | Like many bosses, Jon Kaplan thought he was a good leader. The results seemed to prove it. He worked his way up from aspiring academic to public school teacher to corporate instructional designer and eventually into the top learning job at Discover Financial Services, a Chicago-area firm with 17,000 employees. The only problem? His team didn’t agree with his assessment. “I was there for about three or four years and I had managed to take a team that should have been high performing and I just drove them into the ground,” Jon said. “It just was really unpleasant.” What he did in response catapulted his career forward and led to some of the learning organization’s greatest successes. In this episode of the Chief Learning Officer Podcast, Jon talks about that “crucible of leadership,” how he rebuilt himself and his team in the wake of his failure and how they came to establish the Discover College Commitment, an industry-leading tuition assistance program that all Discover employees are eligible for starting on their first day. Plus, Jon and Justin Lombardo talk about why they left academia for the corporate sector and guest co-host Ashley St. John, managing editor for Chief Learning Officer, shares what she’s learned in her first two years on the job and what she looks for when selecting a magazine profile candidate. Podcast Producer: Jesse McQuarters April 2019 Profile: Discover Financial’s Jon Kaplan | In the list of professions, corporate education isn’t a particularly risky endeavor. It’s not firefighting or high altitude mountain climbing. That’s why it’s particularly important to inject an element of risk into learning and talent development work. There is no growth without it. “You\'re either disrupting, being disrupted or dying,” says Reece Roberson, vice president of HR, global talent management and learning at Interface. That means trying new things, failing and sometimes saying no to executives who have a pet program or initiative they’d like you to build. “If you say yes to everything, you’ll just turn up a bunch of crap,” Roberson says. That same willingness to challenge the status quo goes for personal development, too. He knows that firsthand. In this episode of the Chief Learning Officer Podcast, Reece describes whey he left a comfortable job at Home Depot to start up a new talent and learning function at Interface, an Atlanta-based maker of commercial flooring. The bottom line: sometimes you need to go from getting stuff done to doing big things.

"There\'s no gold watch for anybody anymore," says Zoe Harte, senior vice president of HR and talent innovation for Upwork, a Silicon Valley-based technology company that matches companies and freelance workers. So why wouldn\'t you consider freelancers when designing your learning and development programs? In this episode of the Chief Learning Officer\xa0Podcast, Zoe makes the case for crafting targeted programs to onboard and develop them as part of your learning strategy. How do you do that? Here\'s a hint: Freelancers are people, too. Just like everyone else, they need to understand the purpose and mission of your company in order to do their best work. Plus, she and co-host Justin Lombardo talk about the value retired executives can bring to the company and how to make sure your internal team is ready to work with freelancers.

There’s a constant push and pull taking place in the learning function. Sometimes there’s a need for more control and consistency across the organization. At other times, flexibility and local ownership takes precedence. Stephanie Speights has been at the forefront of that debate for more than a decade. In this podcast recorded live in front of an audience at the House of Blues in Dallas, the chief learning officer of Children’s Health shares how to navigate centralization conversations with executives, tips to overcome organizational skepticism and how important it is to focus on getting the right people on the learning team. Her insights are practical, useful and informed by experience. And that ability to tie learning into the organizational strategy is in demand. Since this episode was recorded, Stephanie took on the CLO role at Parkland Hospital and Health System, one of the largest health systems in Dallas. Plus, co-host Justin Lombardo talks about the three things to look for in a new CLO role and why he thinks centralization is the way to go for the modern learning function.

Quite often, culture is the cause. Mandates and directives from headquarters fail to take into account the nuances of work at the local office. But it’s not just geography or nationality that can sink a global learning program. Internal cultures play a significant and often underestimated role. Even within a single company, there can be scores of different cultures spread across divisions and functions, each with their own norms and rules. Engineers are different from salespeople, IT and HR don’t always align. Jim Irvine, global program manager for learning and development at Renault-Nissan Alliance, knows the challenges firsthand. With operations in nearly every country in the world, his learning organization grapples with the geographic diversity of culture daily. But they also have learned to recognize and work through internal cultures as well. In this podcast recorded live at the CLO Breakfast Club event in Nashville, Jim shares why culture is such an important consideration for learning organizations and why lack of budget and power are no barrier to being an effective learning leader. Plus, co-host Justin Lombardo shares his biggest mistakes when it comes to culture and what they taught him about being a more effective learning executive.

That’s a big miss in a competitive economy where talent is the currency. Either due to a lack of vision or a short-sighted strategy, organizations simply don’t think long and hard enough about how to build a robust pipeline that delivers talented people from schools into the workplace. When Meredith Oakes took over BNY Mellon’s talent pipeline development in 2017, she set out to change that dynamic. That began with looking beyond the stereotypes to understand what early career professionals actually want from work and turning that into programs that deliver long-term value for them as well as the 200-plus year old Wall Street stalwart. In this podcast recorded live at the City Winery in New York City, Meredith shares why BNY Mellon made pipeline development a strategic priority and what other learning executives can learn from their programs about how to build long-term relationships with early career professionals. Plus, co-host and resident CLO Breakfast Club health expert Justin Lombardo offers his tips for navigating flu season and how working with schools and universities is exactly the type of work at which chief learning officers can excel.

You got started in business because you wanted to make a profit. Yet money is not just business; it’s emotional too. Money can cause disagreements, make us feel amazing, or frustrated. So what’s a practical way to view money in your business?\xa0 \xa0 In this episode, you’ll learn how to set real, practical, and beneficial financial goals for your business. We’ll look at how else business success can be defined, and the one question I answered that changed my life.\xa0 \xa0 Success in Business Doesn’t Always Look Like Revenue “As a business owner, money is messy.” Let’s break down a practical approach to set realistic financial goals. For so many of us, we’ve heard that business success looks like making $100k in our first year so we feel frustrated when we don’t hit this magic number.\xa0 “How do you measure success in your business?”\xa0 True business success can be measured in several different ways:\xa0  Amount of impact you want to have Title Time freedom Happiness Ability to volunteer or give back Take-home pay Savings  \xa0 My Financial Goal Journey In my first two years as an entrepreneur, success to me looked like profit and time freedom. These past two years, I’ve reframed success to look like profits and impact. I want to help equip, empower, and mentor women to be successful with the skills they already have.\xa0 However, in my first two years, I was only striving to reach $100k in revenue. Because of this drive, I lost out on family dinners, time with my kids, date nights, health, and happiness. I thought the magic number of $100k would do it for me. “There is no magic number in revenue. The only magic is in how you define success.” “The more profit, the more we save, share, and invest. Revenue can’t do any of that. “ “The most impactful number we need to feel success is profit; what you actually take home and contribute to your family. “ \xa0 Three Steps to Help You Define Your Financial Goals  Start by understanding what the business\'s contribution to your personal or household finances should be. Set your real business goals by using the Good-Better-Best framework.\xa0 Update your business plan.\xa0  But let’s say that you’re not meeting your Good goal. You can correct it in three ways:  launching a new product/service or a current product/service more often,\xa0 increase your pricing, and\xa0 find efficiencies to minimize expenses.  \xa0 A Great Next Step as You Plan Your Financial Goals If you have clients and your current product or service is selling AND you’re ready for your business to run with more ease, get on the waitlist for the A-Team Accelerator. You’ll set up systems just like the one we talked about today with finances, goals, and pricing. And many more. Plus you’ll get a solid community of people who are just like you.\xa0 Real Talk about Financial Goals In my first two years of business, I worked hard but wasn’t living the legacy kind of life I hoped for. Then my husband and I sat down and talked about the question that changed my life: “What monetarily do I need to bring home?”\xa0 This one question reframed how I organized my days, my offers, and my pricing. I encourage you to ask yourself if you are in alignment with what you need to bring home as well?

That’s where systems come in. But what does a system look like? How can it help you grow and scale your business? In this episode, we’re going behind the scenes of my business. My right-hand operations superstar Esther Littlefield shares what systems we have in place, what steps make up those systems, and how systems can fail.\xa0 If you consistently perform the same tasks over and over, it’s time to get those tasks into a system. Let’s get started in systemizing your business so you can grow your business and increase your profits.\xa0 \xa0 Esther’s Role within The Ops Authority Business Esther and I have worked together for several years, and she manages and implements many things in my business. She leads Morningstar Media Services, a business that focuses on launching and maintaining podcasts. However, she started as my VA. Esther is my person and is truly an extension of me. \xa0 All About Systems What a System Is A system is a group of things that are all working together to accomplish one particular outcome. A system involves multiple people, steps, and processes to get one objective accomplished. We’re not talking about tech tools here; we’re talking about step-by-step workflows, procedures, and processes.\xa0 Why You Need Business Systems In Order to Scale Your business started with a passion, and you were likely doing everything. Over time, you may start to feel tired, and you need systems for the repeatable tasks in your business. This also allows you to start delegating some of your processes and focusing on what you do best. Systems allow you to step out of the day-to-day operations and into a leadership role, where you can pursue your vision. \xa0 Why CEOs Delay Creating Systems The big drawback is that creating systems takes extra time on the front end. You also may think, “No one can take this over. I’ll always do this thing.” So you don’t create a system. CEOs also fear outsourcing. Handing tasks over to someone else takes trust. \xa0 Behind the Scenes of The Ops Authority’s Systems Esther and I chat about the systems that we have within my business. Here are some of the things we have systems for inside The Ops Authority:  Content (blog, podcast, social media, sending weekly emails) Lead generation Growing my email list Launch Plans SOPs  If your business has an online presence, your business is dependent on content and marketing. Help yourself by creating a system about the way you deliver content.\xa0 One of Our Systems: Blog Posts  I have a writer, Abby from Write Solutions, who writes my blog posts.  She gathers information, writes the content, then attaches the written blog post to our Trello card.   Esther creates + uploads.  Esther’s team creates the graphics and also uploads, formats, and schedules the post in WordPress. Esther’s team schedules the social media posts.   Abby writes the corresponding email about the blog post and gets that content to Esther, who distributes it to my email list.  This process seems like a few short steps, but it takes up considerable time. We use Trello, which tracks the entire workflow for every blog post. The blogpost card has a checklist for every phase. We also use Voxer to ask and answer questions and to communicate changes.\xa0 Remember that we can create systems, but sometimes people run late or miss a deadline. It’s very important to have a good project manager who you know and trust who can keep the system moving.\xa0 \xa0 Weaknesses in the Process If one early step falls behind, the rest of the process is at risk for missing the pre-established deadlines. People also go on vacation or get sick. One person missing out on their work can cause a breakdown in the plan. The solution? Work ahead by batching the work you do.\xa0 Next, we talk about another system that we have in place inside The Ops Authority: this podcast! Esther’s team manages this process, so she shares \xa0 Esther’s Podcast Production System This is a high-level overview of the 7-8 phases of a podcast production process. This example is for someone who wants to make podcasting their primary content marketing arm of their business. \xa0  Create audio (scheduled, prepped, recorded, edited) Write copy (show notes, blog post or summary, social media) Create graphics Upload recording to the podcast host (example: Libsyn) Upload recording to WordPress Schedule and promote social media content Follow-up with guests (if you have an interview show) Optional: If you have an interview show, you may need an admin to handle a lot of the scheduling pre-interview and to deal with the communication with the guests.  Each of these phases in the system have multiple steps within them. Most of Esther’s podcasts that she manages have 60-70 items on the Trello checklist for each episode. \xa0 How to Create Your System if You Don’t Have a Team Not everyone has a team, but you can still create a system for the repeatable processes in your business. Spend time writing down what you want your systems to look like.\xa0 Also, you can grab this free podcast workflow checklist Esther created for you if you need help getting your podcast process organized.\xa0 Start with a checklist of what is involved, and then save up so you can have people support you. You can do hard things, but doing repeatable tasks prevents you from leading your business and reaching your vision. Esther reminded us that if you don’t have someone to manage a process for you, you are the manager of that process. Keep in mind that you need to set aside time to manage whatever systems you have in place. \xa0 Another System: Launch Plans I have two programs I launch: A-Team Accelerator and the Director of Operations Certification Program. Instead of re-inventing the wheel every time, Esther and I have a repeatable launch plan process.\xa0 Esther sets up a Trello board outlining what is included in each launch. Then she makes a copy of that board for future launches. After a launch, Esther and I reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Esther has the Trello boards organized by what tasks must happen four weeks out, three weeks out, etc. Are You Ready to Scale Your Business?

Are you curious if you use your time wisely? Are you ready to run a more profitable business? Every small business owner has limited time and desires success, so here’s how you can inventory your productivity and maximize your time. \xa0 If you feel like you’re in a work slump and you’re unsure how to get out, start by assessing your productivity. Let’s take a look at how you’re using your time. In this episode, you’ll learn how to assess how you spend your work hours and how to make small tweaks so you stay focused on your goals. If you’re ready for tough love and wise strategy, tune in. \xa0 Productivity vs. Hustle Your day should be designed to fit you. There’s no specific formula of how your day “should” look. Remember that your productive day will look different from others. Instead, examine your work-day patterns. \xa0 Productivity doesn’t mean every second is filled with a business task. \xa0 When every minute is occupied, that’s hustle and it’s not what I want for you. Hustling leads to frustration, burnout, and overwhelm.\xa0 \xa0 There will be times of seasonal hustle, e.g. a launch or putting out a new product. However, hustling should not be your norm because it is unsustainable for long periods of time.\xa0 \xa0 How to Know If You’re Intentionally Productive If you feel sluggish or unproductive, audit your time. Record what you do in your business for three to five days. How?  Grab this download, created just for you. Set a timer for 60 minutes. When the timer goes off, record what you did for the last hour. Hit repeat on your timer.\xa0 Continue this process of recording what you do 60 minutes at a time throughout your workday.  \xa0 Once you’ve tracked your time for three to five days, ask yourself:  What category does each task belong to, e.g. meeting, creation, scrolling, personal? What strategic objective does this task fall under? Where do I see patterns? When do I attack tasks I put off? Does where I spend my time match my #1 priority?  \xa0 Follow These Suggestions to Maximize Your Productivity As I’ve tracked and tweaked how I spend my time, here are a few best practices to make your workday even more productive: \xa0  Think through if you want to batch your days or do you like your current system. Block off one or two “Get It Done Days” per month. Batch administrative activities.\xa0 If you find yourself switching back and forth between communicating with clients through email, Voxer, or calls, stop the madness by creating an expectations document for your clients that outlines when you’re available and through which platform. Another option is to set aside time each day for returning messages. Set up a time each day to housework, e.g. putting away the dishes or throwing in a load of laundry. Hire help for housework if you have the revenue to do it. Train your family to help you with housework. Spend time documenting what you do every day.  \xa0 Weekly Ops Activity  Download your time tracker document here and start tracking your time Share a screenshot of your tracker on the Weekly Ops Activity thread on Friday!

What should you look for? What questions do you need to ask before investing money and time into a system? How does the way you think impact the tool you need?\xa0 \xa0 In this episode, certified DOO and founder of Simplified Ops Collective Cadri Cunningham and I talk through what a project management system is, why you need one, and how to pick the right one for you. We share our favorite tools and break down the pros and cons of the top four options in the marketplace.\xa0 \xa0 What is a Project Management Tool? A project management tool helps you create accountability for yourself, oversight for your projects and tasks, and show you the accomplishments you’ve had in your business.\xa0 \xa0 Project management tools differ from note-taking tools. With a note-taking tool like a Google Doc or Evernote, you can’t track, be held accountable, or share tasks with a team.\xa0 Why These Tools are Important These tools allow you to:  Track deadlines Connect daily actions to your vision Provide understanding of all the steps in your project Outline who owns each task  \xa0 A system needs to work for those who use it. Don’t go with the shiny new tool. Use what works for you or else it’s ineffective. \xa0 Questions to Help You Choose the Right Tool for You Questions a DOO Will Ask  Which project management tool do you use? Do you really use it? Who keeps up with the information in the tool? In other words, who “owns” the tool? Why do you use it?  \xa0 Questions to Ask Yourself  Is your current tool working for you? Do you check it everyday? If it doesn’t work for you, what features are missing? What is complicated about your current system?  To-do list people are often linear thinkers. Board view people are often visual thinkers. If you’re unsure where you land, ask yourself how you plan your child’s birthday party. Whatever process you use in “real life” will be similar to how you think about your business.   Do you prefer a to-do list or board view?\xa0 Do you like a calendar view for tasks? Do you like a simple system or a more involved system? Is there a specific project management tool designed for your industry? (Interior designers, attorneys, and home-schoolers have their own tools.) What document storage program tool do you use and does it integrate with your project management tool? Do you use a lot of processes and workflows? Do you like your tasks to move from left to right (visual thinker) or top to bottom (linear thinker)? Do you have a lot of repeated tasks? Does the project management tool allow for that? Do you need a tool with automation features?\xa0 What does your budget look like for systems and tools?  \xa0 Questions to Ask if You Work with a Team  How many people do you need to communicate with? Do you need to be able to track time within the project management tool? How much are you doing together within the tool?\xa0  \xa0 Project Management Tool Options There are a variety of options for project management tools. We share some of our favorites and the pros and cons of various tools. Natalie and Cadri’s Top Picks I default to Trello because I’ve used it for so long. However, I’m also interested in Teamwork because of the messaging capability and task management features. It also has a CRM. ClickUp also has my interest because it can show you all your projects at one time. \xa0 Cadri prefers Asana because she loves to-do lists and the clean interface. She can also organize by task and it offers a calendar view. She also loves SubCast because of the to-do list capability. \xa0 Pros and Cons of the Top Project Management Tools Trello  It’s good when you have just a few projects, and it allows you to track workflows.\xa0 It’s visually stimulating, you can get lost if you don’t set it up well, and there’s no calendar piece.  \xa0 Asana  It offers a clean interface, to-do list and board views, and the free version is perfect for most organizations. You can only have a limited number of people on your team and you can’t see timelines.  \xa0 Teamwork  It allows client and team communication. It can get pricey and doesn’t have automation functionality.  \xa0 ClickUp  It offers a lot of features at a low price point and integrates with lots of systems. It seems bulky and the multitude of features makes it overwhelming.\xa0   Weekly Ops Activity Post the tool of your choice and let me know if this episode spurred you to assess the tool you’re currently using.

But this won’t be what you’re expecting… or what you always hear about on this topic.\xa0 \xa0 While productivity doesn’t necessarily fall inside the realm of operations, planning for it does. Yes, plan for productivity… you heard that right.\xa0 \xa0 Productivity doesn’t just happen. It’s always purposeful, which is why a plan is needed. We’re going to talk about a few things you can do to create a productive culture for your business. \xa0 Creating a plan for what you’re going to do takes the emotion out of deciding what to do when you sit down to work. Plus, it allows you to get straight to work and to delegate with confidence. \xa0 “There are two things that are contagious in business: productivity and success.” This is what I want for you: productivity that leads to a leaner business, shorter workdays, and larger launches. \xa0 3 Productivity Hacks: Create an Ideal Week for You Your ideal week is a visual map of how you will use your time throughout a week. It should include both personal and professional obligations… oh and some white space too. \xa0 How are you going to create your ideal week?  Create a new calendar in Google Calendar.  List those priorities out Give each priority a color   Know what your priorities are in this season of life. Add in your top priorities on the calendar first. Now add in your work time. Optional: theme your days based on what you want to focus on each day of the week. Get granular and block off times for the key activities in your business.\xa0Caveat: don’t fall into the temptation to remove your personal activities from your calendar to make space for work. Now look at the color distribution on your calendar. Are you leaving enough white space? Because things are going to come up and things will take longer than you expect Print it out and/or update your scheduling software (i.e. Acuity/Calendly). Share you calendar with your team! Use the calendar and recalibrate as needed.  \xa0 Create Your Business Hub So what exactly is a Business Hub? Well, it’s a centralized place for all things business. It’s no secret that to run your business efficiently, a hub with important info or commonly requested items is a time saver.\xa0 \xa0 But deeper than that, it allows you to have one place where these items live so when a new team member joins, there\'s less strain on you to find or spend hours digging. \xa0 So what should be included on your Business Hub? There are some basics that I recommend such as your bio, important links, testimonials, branding information, your MVV, and legal docs like website policies or contract agreements. \xa0 To make this super easy for you, I’ve created a template for you that you can easily copy and use for yourself! Go to theopsauthority.com/businesshub to grab it for yourself. This is a Trello board, but if you prefer another tool, you can use the Trello template as an example and create your own in your favorite tool. \xa0 Create Your SOPs SOPs stands for Standard Operating Procedures. This acronym gets tossed around a lot in the growing and scaling business world. And that’s for a reason. As a new business, your focus should be, or is likely, on revenue and visibility.\xa0 \xa0 But after you get your footing and shift to scaling, your operations will soon take over. That’s why documenting your processes is absolutely essential. It will help you scale your business by working smarter, not harder. \xa0 You might be wondering where to start with SOPs. These are processes, workflows, or systems that you use to get your work done. Most often they involve administrative activities and have several tasks linked together to reach the outcome.\xa0 \xa0 So how do you get started? Here’s a plan:\xa0  Determine the 1-3 processes that you’d like to outsource when the time (and finances) allow. Some examples are email management, sending invoices, and content creation. Record your process. You can write them out in a list format or a video using something like Loom. Don’t let perfectionism slow you down because these will be updated over time. Put your processes in your Business Hub.  \xa0 As a recap, you’ll want to carve out some time and complete these three things: create an ideal week calendar in Google Calendar, complete the Business Hub, and start your SOPs with 1-3 processes you want to outsource. \xa0 Weekly Ops Activity Complete your Ideal Week and share a screenshot in the Ops Insiders! \xa0 Key Quotes from the Episode: “There are two things that are contagious in business: productivity and success.” “Make sure that YOU are represented on this calendar.” \xa0 Connect with Me: Website Private Facebook Community Facebook Page Instagram \xa0 This episode was originally published on theopsauthority.com/podcast/8 | From the perspective of the CEO, what is it like to be supported by a Director of Operations? Why do you need a DOO? What are the first action items a DOO will handle in your business? \xa0 In this episode, I visit with Dana Malstaff, CEO of Boss Mom, and Amy Lockrin, Dana’s DOO and CEO of The Operations House, about what the CEO-DOO relationship looks like. We pull back the curtain on how these two roles work together and why you need a DOO in your life.\xa0 If you’ve ever wondered what a DOO can do for you, listen to this transparent and honest conversation with Dana and Amy.\xa0 \xa0 How the CEO & DOO Roles Work at Boss Mom How Dana + Amy Connected Dana started Boss Mom in 2015 after she’d had a baby and was starting her own business. She literally wrote the book on moms in entrepreneurship, “Boss Mom.” Then she started the Boss Mom community. Since then, she’s launched a podcast with a million downloads and has written two more books.\xa0 Amy joined the Boss Mom program and went to a Boss Mom retreat. She felt pulled to Dana’s leadership. While at the retreat, she talked to Dana about her future and joining her team. Amy has served as Dana’s DOO for the past two years.\xa0 \xa0 How Dana Felt Once She Had a DOO Dana says that Amy brings two wins to the table:  She takes all Dana’s ideas then organizes and delegates them. She tells Dana, “Here are all the things you’re not doing anymore.” Amy is Dana’s “Brain Activator.” Dana loves to hop on a call or Vox with Amy and share all her ideas. Then Amy asks strategic questions about those ideas. Dana is thankful she isn’t the only “thinker” in her business because Amy can see the big picture and handle the details. It helps Dana that her creative ideas go into a logical space.  \xa0 What Amy Did First in Dana’s Business Amy started out as a trial employee before coming on regularly, which is a good way to know if that person is a fit. She mapped out all the offers of Dana’s business on one page. Amy also looked at Dana’s structure. Amy says her job is to see where Dana is coming from, what she wants the business to become, and to hold her accountable to that. \xa0 Summarizing What a DOO Does Amy provides structure to the team: what they’re doing and who should perform each task. Amy is there to be a strategic sounding board and ask, “Does this make sense?” A good DOO understands human nature to leverage everyone’s skills and talents. A DOO will meet the CEO where she is. You want to find someone you’re comfortable with, who gets your jokes and your energy. \xa0 How to Determine if You Need a DOO in Your Business It depends on what kind of business you want and what you\'re trying to build. As soon as you have more than one team member or if you’re launching a product or service, Dana believes you need someone to manage the team/launch. A DOO helps you understand your goals and stay on task. The DOO will help the CEO spend her time in the right place. As the CEO, you need to spend the time your DOO is saving you on what brings in revenue \xa0 Sharing Financial Information with the DOO Dana and Amy have budget calls every other week because both parties need to know where the money is going, where they want it to go, and to see what products are most successful. You must be completely honest in your business so your DOO can set up the right processes. If you’re ready to open up your financials to someone else, you’re ready to have a DOO. \xa0 Why You Need a DOO in Your Business Form relationships with those that complement you. Find someone who helps you finish. You need someone in your business who can make it happen and manage it when you need to step away. \xa0 Connect with Dana and Amy Dana Malstaff is the CEO and Founder of Boss Mom. She is a mother, author, speaker, business strategist, podcaster, blind spot reducer, and movement maker. She launched the Boss Mom brand with her first book Boss Mom: The Ultimate Guide to Raising a Business & Nurturing Your Family Like a Pro in 2015 and has turned the brand into an international movement. Now she has over 20,000 students in various courses and an organically grown Facebook group of over 40k that helps women all over the world raise their businesses and babies at the same time. She believes that we need to show our children that doing what we love can be financially viable. \xa0 Amy Lockrin is the CEO and Head Integrator of The Operations House, an Integration and Implementation Agency for small business owners that are ready to thrive in their business and leave behind the overwhelm of "to-do\'s." She and her team make things happen in your business so you can go back to being creative through project management, back end "clean-ups", launches, and strategic planning sessions.

And how do you create these measurements? In this episode, you’ll learn what a KPI is and how to establish KPIs for the most important areas in your small business. There’s no need to be overwhelmed by setting KPIs because I’ll show you how to do it in five easy steps.\xa0 \xa0 What is a KPI? KPI is an ominous acronym that makes you feel like, “I’ll come back to that later.” A KPI is a Key Performance Indicator. It’s a measured value, which measures how effective your organization or business is in achieving its goals.\xa0 \xa0 KPIs are so great because they provide you and your team with feedback on exactly how you’re doing, they allow you to cast a vision, and they measure how you’re attaining what you set out to do.  How to Establish a KPI for Your Business  Start with your vision. What is the vision you have for your business? You’ll want to have a 6-12 month vision and a 3-year vision. Your vision should be big and defines success for you in the next 12 - 36 months. Put your vision on paper. Want to learn more about vision?\xa0Go here. What is the goal this year that you’ll focus on that gets you closer to your vision? Rank the seven strategic objectives. Then determine your top three to four. Create a metric that ties back to your vision. For example, if visibility is one of your top strategic objectives, ask yourself, “What am I doing from a visibility perspective to help me reach my vision?” Every metric must tie back to a strategic objective. Ask yourself these questions:  “If I was to succeed with ______, what would the outcome be? “How will I measure this?” “Who’s responsible for it?”    \xa0 \xa0 You may pull a lot of metrics, but not all are worthy of being called a KPI. You should have between three and five KPIs. You may pull metrics for 30 areas, but you’ll have a limited number of KPIs. \xa0 You may need to pull data daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly to determine if you’re reaching your KPIs.\xa0 \xa0 Examples of KPIs for the Different Pillars  Financial Steadiness: revenue, profit, operating expenses, customer lifetime value Visibility: conversion percentage, cost per lead, site visits, number of subscribers Product Creation + Refinement: sales rate, average order value Operational Excellence: ROI Team Growth: task completion rate, on-time percentage, employee turnover Customer Experience: net promoter score, retention rates  \xa0 Previous Episodes Mentioned Ep. 4: The Core of Business: Mission, Vision, Values Ep. 5: The Seven Pillars to Your Business Strategy Key Quotes from the Episode: “KPIs are metrics that will measure how effective your business is achieving its goals.” “Every KPI is a metric, but not every metric is a KPI.”\xa0 \xa0 Connect with Me: Website Private Facebook Community Facebook Page Instagram \xa0 This episode was originally published on theopsauthority.com/podcast/6 | As a small business owner, you feel pulled in a thousand directions, right? Well, there are seven reasons for this because there are seven areas vying for your attention all day, every day. Keep in mind that in the corporate world, there’s a C-level position for all seven of these areas.\xa0 \xa0 So what are the seven areas clamoring for your attention? How can you prioritize them? What are the questions you need to ask yourself as you build, grow, or scale your business? Tune in to this episode where guest and certified DOO Andrea Layne and I break down the seven pillars of your business and what you can do next to make your business thrive. \xa0 The Seven Pillars to Your Business Strategy\xa0 There are seven areas in your business pulling for your attention. Let’s break them down: \xa0 1. Financial Steadiness This is not all about revenue, but establishing a solid financial foundation. Ask yourself these questions as you think through this pillar:  Are my business expenses categorized each month? Do I look at my profit and loss statement? Am I saving for taxes? Do I know how much I need to bring home? When will I carve out time to get this done?  \xa0 In the corporate world, the CFO would oversee these responsibilities. \xa02.\xa0Visibility You may spend a lot of time here because you want people to be aware of your product, but don’t spend so much time here that you neglect the other six pillars.\xa0 \xa0 Think through these questions:  Is my getting name out there? Do people know me?  \xa0 In the corporate world, the CMO would oversee these responsibilities. \xa0 3. Product Creation and Refinement This area is responsible for generating revenue. It’s exciting to dream up new products and services, but you must also integrate and execute these ideas within the context of your mission. You’ll also want to keep refining and improving your current products.\xa0 \xa0 Ask yourself these questions as you think through this pillar:  How will I strategically provide my product? How will I price it? How do I get it into the marketplace?  \xa0 4. Operational Excellence This is about people, systems, and software coming together so your business works effectively. This pillar involves automations and workflows. You get time back when you systematize.\xa0 \xa0 Ask yourself these questions as you think through this pillar:  What processes will I automate? How will my processes fit together to make my business run effectively and efficiently? What standard operating procedures can I put in place? How can you systematize my business?  \xa0 You can’t scale without systems. What do we mean by “scale?” There are three phases of business:  The building phase is your start-up phase. The growing phase means you have established revenue and you’re looking to increase profit margin. Think of the growing phase as addition. The scaling phase brings in more team members to get products out faster. Think of the scaling phase as the multiplication.  \xa0 In the corporate world, the COO would oversee these responsibilities. \xa0 5. Team Growth Who do you need on your team to scale your business? You need human capital to run and grow your business because it helps you multiply yourself. In this phase you may lean on a VA, DOO, strategists, or a graphic designer.\xa0 \xa0 Ask yourself these questions as you think through this pillar:  Am I providing a succession plan for my team members? How can I retain the people most helping my business? Do I bring people on as independent contractors or employees?  \xa0 In the corporate world, the CAO would oversee these responsibilities. \xa0 6. Customer Experience This is about how you’ll delight your customers. Customer Experience involves thinking through what your client will do once she’s signed on. This pillar isn’t about gifts, but more about communication and interacting with your customer throughout your relationship together.\xa0 \xa0 Ask yourself these questions as you think through this pillar:  How will I onboard? What’s the process for contracts? How will I invoice my client? How will we communicate? What expectations do I need to set? What’s the best way to build a relationship with this client?  \xa0 In the corporate world, the “Director of Happiness” or “Director of Community” would oversee these responsibilities. \xa0 7. Growth + Development This is about how your professional growth. Ask yourself these questions as you think through this pillar:  What books, courses, paid groups, or masterminds will benefit me? What are my work boundaries, and am I articulating those to my family and clients? Do I need to stop learning and start doing?  \xa0 Weekly Ops Activity  Spend 30 minutes and prioritize these seven pillars for yourself. Label them from 1 through 7. Think about one task or project in each area that needs to be addressed.\xa0 Post your priority list in the FB group.  \xa0 Note: In your business, you will spend most of your time on your top two to three pillars. Stay focused! \xa0 Key Quotes from the Episode:  “Know that visibility is at the top for most businesses.” “When you can make your operations more streamlined and more efficient, that’s where you gain a lot of momentum.” - Andrea Layne\xa0 “You’re going to scale by using human capital to create growth in your business.” “So much of the customer experience comes down to clear communication.” “The seven pillars don’t go away. We just learn how to prioritize them better and outsource the weakest links.” “What happens with too many distractions? We never meet our vision.”  \xa0 Connect with Andrea Layne Andrea Layne is a business engineer who helps her clients take their vision and put smart strategies behind it so they can build a business to last.

This experience gave her a foundation and process for helping businesses run more effectively.

While she adored "playing with flowers" all the time, she realized it was taking her away from her family more and more as it grew. So after 6 years, she knew it was time to pursue a different option. That\'s when Andrea came back to her roots as a consultant, but this time working with creative, service-oriented entrepreneurs to guide them to financial success with less overwhelm.\xa0 \xa0 She knows big business.... she has strategized systems and engineered software for giant corporations. And she deeply knows small business, because Andrea has been there in the trenches.... making mistakes and having successes.

Where do values fit in? Why is it so important to articulate these pieces? \xa0 The core of your business is your mission, vision, and values. You need to clearly identify and articulate what these are, especially as you bring on members for your team. Walk through the mission, vision, and values exercise with a free workbook I created just for you. Just go here to grab it.\xa0 \xa0 Why Mission, Vision, and Values are Important to Your Business Your business will change so quickly and you’ll want to review these foundational pieces annually. If you have a team, sit down and do this exercise with them. Having a mission, vision, and values gives you a framework to refer back to as opportunities pop up.\xa0 \xa0 Your Mission Statement Define your mission statement, a.k.a. your declaration of purpose. Why is your business a business? The mission statement will be concise and specific so customers understand your purpose and how you provide value.\xa0 \xa0 To test your mission statement, ask yourself, “Would my competitors use this exact same statement?” \xa0 Use these questions to craft your mission statement:  What do I do? How do I do it? Who do I do it for? What value do I bring? Why do I exist as an organization? What do I provide for my customers? What will I be remembered for? What’s my overall intention? What do I do well that nobody else does?  \xa0 It all goes back to your declaration of purpose. Your mission should articulate who you’re working with, what services you offer, and what your priorities are. Remember that your mission statement is actionable. \xa0 Your Vision Statement\xa0 Your vision statement is aspirational and dreamy. It’s how your business would exist in its most successful state. The vision is a broad view of how your company will leave a big impact on your customers and the community you serve. If you were to meet all of your goals, what would your company be like in 5-10 years? \xa0 You don’t have to have a solution. Just dream big. \xa0 Think about where your business is going in the future and what problems you expect to solve that you’re not solving today. It could start with, “By 2025, my organization will …”\xa0 \xa0 Vision statements are internal. You won’t see it on your website or in sales copy. It doesn’t need to be shared with those outside your organization. \xa0 Your Core Values Describe what your organization believes in and how it behaves. Your values make up the moral compass for your company.\xa0  Use these questions to craft your core values:  What are my guiding principles? What are my core beliefs? What do I stand for? What am I opposed to? What type of clients do I like to work with?  \xa0 For me, I value candor, leadership, details, reliability, and honesty.\xa0 \xa0 Don’t skip over this step. As you hire, these core values will guide you to the right person.\xa0 \xa0 Remember to get the free download to walk you through these exercises.\xa0 Weekly Ops Activity Go to the Ops Insiders Community and attach a picture of you working through the free mission, vision, and values guide.

How can you have a greater sense of what’s going on in your business?\xa0 \xa0 In this episode, I’ll walk you through a business summary and strategic operations planning. If you’ve ever wondered how to be more organized and intentional about growing your business from the foundation up, then this episode is a must-listen. \xa0 Decades ago, starting a business including going to a physical bank with a written business plan, which was analyzed by a committee. In order to get funding for your business, a sound plan was essential.\xa0 \xa0 A business plan is just as important today as it was decades ago. Why? When you have a business plan, you improve the trajectory of where your business is going and you have a must greater sense of what is and will happen in your future. You’ll also be more organized.\xa0 \xa0 The Essentials of Your Business Foundation 1. Business Summary This involves some thinking time! Your business summary is your true foundation and the reason you’re in business. \xa0 A business summary is comprised of six parts:  Mission - What do you do and who do you serve? Vision - Where will your business be in five years? What does success look like?\xa0 Values - What characteristics and qualities are really important to you?\xa0 Boundaries - What limits will you set around your work day or vacations?\xa0 Avatar - Who is your ideal customer? Competitors - Who sells a similar product and how are you different?  \xa0 2. Future Accomplishments What will you accomplish by this time next year? What does success look like for you in 12 months? Think about: \xa0  Profit Revenue Clients Anecdotal feedback, i.e. your ideal testimonial  \xa0 3. Your Financial Needs How much do you need to bring in every month or quarter?\xa0 \xa0 My husband and I sit down once a year and determine what I need to contribute to our household. We have three financial goals: \xa0  The Good Number is what I need to contribute to cover the basics. The Better Number is just a step above from the the Good Number. The Best Number is a stretch goal that’s off the charts, and may only be reached with something like a launch. The Best Number isn’t something I’ll reach each month.\xa0  \xa0 4. What You Sell What are your offers? If you’re new in business, you may have quite a few products or services, but this should decrease over time.\xa0 \xa0 Look at your offers then look at your Good Number. Determine how many products you need to sell to meet your Good Number.\xa0 \xa0 These four pieces of your business foundation make up the backbone of your business. Now, let’s move into my proprietary framework. \xa0 5. Strategic Planning These seven pieces comprise strategic operations planning for your business:  Financial Steadiness Product Development + Innovation Scaling + Growing Your Team Operational Efficiencies Development + Growth Visibility + Marketing Customer + Client Experience  \xa0 Look at all seven areas in your business then determine your priorities 1 through 7 because you only have so much time. HINT: Your financial steadiness is almost always the #1 priority.\xa0 \xa0 6. What Does Success Look Like (KPIs) Now you need to measure these priorities. Determine your key performance indicators (KPI) for these seven areas because you want to know if you’re succeeding. What metric will you use to validate that you’re doing well? \xa0 For example, let’s say Visibility + Marketing is your #2 priority. You want more eyes on your business so your KPI may be how many views you need on your website each week to earn a profit. You may need 30,000 page views to earn $15,000. Or you may determine the number of people you need at the top of your sales funnel to reach a financial goal. \xa0 How are you tracking what you’re doing so you can analyze data and then change course? \xa0 7. Your Annual Plan\xa0 The annual plan looks at your market. For example, if you sell paper planners, when does your audience start to think about planners? When is your prime selling cycle? Make notes from your competitors and see when they sell and promote. \xa0 You’ll also want to think through when you want to take vacation time. For me, I’m less productive in summer and Christmas. Document what you’re doing so you don’t plan launches when you’d rather be with your family on vacation. \xa0 You also want to be intentional with your marketing schedule. Think about what your offers are and when you’ll launch a new product.\xa0 Weekly Ops Activity  Go to theopsauthority.com/foundation to access the free Trello board Complete your business foundation Screenshot and share inside the Ops Insiders group!  \xa0 Key Quotes from the Episode: “A business plan is just as important today as it was decades ago.” “Everything hinges on mission, vision, and values.” “An uneducated owner is one that can easily be taken down very quickly.” \xa0 Connect with Me: Website Private Facebook Community Facebook Page Instagram \xa0 This episode was originally published on theopsauthority.com/podcast/3', 'chan_desc': 'You can’t ignore the back-end pieces that have to work together and flow smoothly in order to build a brand, grow a movement or disrupt an industry.

And we hope they will contact the office if they aren’t feeling better -- or they start to feel worse. The reality is that many patients don’t contact their healthcare provider, or don't contact soon enough. This can lead to poor outcomes and more hospital and doctor visits.Enter remote patient monitoring systems, which connect patients to their physician’s office through devices that automatically monitor important clinical indicators such as weight, glucose levels, or blood pressure and alert providers when something’s not right.

Sarah Wierman shares her inspiring story and helpful insights into joining the manufacturing industry and how being willing to learn and ask questions can open up new and exciting opportunities. Be sure to listen to the episode for a unique look into changing career paths and learning the ropes of manufacturing from a beginner’s perspective.\xa0 Connect with us:www.MakingChips.com/contact From deaf studies to a manufacturing career: Sarah’s story of embracing change\xa0 Working on obtaining her bachelor’s degree in deaf studies, Sarah tried a job in sign language and teaching but found that she hated it. She decided to take a break from her education and took a job in sales at Raptor Workholding on the recommendation of a friend. Little did she know that she would soon fall in love with the manufacturing industry and find her new passion and calling.\xa0 The initial appeal in a sales job was the travel opportunities. Sarah soon discovered that manufacturing was more than producing and delivering products. It was creativity and masterful workmanship created to meet an incredibly wide spectrum of needs - from replacing knees to providing building supplies. Inspired, Sarah took it upon herself to learn as much as she could about the industry and asked questions of everyone she met. “I never stopped talking to people,” she shares. Vendor shows and visiting other shops to sell live tooling afforded her plenty of opportunities to deepen her knowledge of machining.\xa0 Don’t confuse lack of experience with the inability to take action When Sarah first began her job as a sales rep at Raptor, she didn’t even know what a CNC machine was. After a year of intense learning and diving into the new world of manufacturing, she realized that she wanted to stay in the industry long-term. Her eagerness to learn opened new doors, and she took a job as the regional manager at MD Tooling. “Your lack of experience in the industry doesn’t make you ignorant,” she says. “It makes you eager.” If you find that you truly want to be a part of the manufacturing industry, then you need to be willing to take on the responsibility of learning - and learning well. Listen to the episode to learn more about why Sarah fell in love with machining and why she decided to pursue a manufacturing career. Sarah’s positive experience as a woman in the manufacturing industry\xa0 Even though there are many women in the manufacturing industry, it still isn’t common. Sarah shares her experiences entering into and growing in an industry that is still considered a man’s world. “It is what you make of it,” she says. Even though some of the people she worked with initially found her presence odd, there was never any hostility or opposition. Once her fellow workers discovered that Sarah was willing to learn and put her best foot forward in every job and customer encounter, they embraced her unique perspectives and place within the team.\xa0 Sarah shares that while it can be intimidating entering a workforce made up almost entirely of men as a young woman, the important thing to focus on is the experience that you are offering customers and your teammates. View obstacles as challenges and find ways to overcome them. It’s about being collaborative and willing to find the solution and solve the problems that arise. Everyone has something unique to offer, and being confident in one’s perspective - while also acting and speaking in humility - will take you farther than you ever thought possible.\xa0 Use unique avenues to learn something new Learning about a new career opportunity can be daunting. Sarah shares some tips for exploring the manufacturing industry as a new career. Mentors can be invaluable in helping you navigate how to get started, who to talk to, and how to put your best foot forward. Investing in relationships should be a key component of your entire career, but especially when starting out. You will always need others to help you and provide a place for you to seek advice. Never stop asking questions and making room for edifying voices in your life.\xa0 Social media isn’t just a business marketing tool. It can be a learning tool for exploring new career paths as well! Sarah explains how she began an Instagram page for Raptor Workholding and soon discovered other manufacturing-related pages from which she learned an invaluable amount of insight and skill. Don’t be intimidated by having to learn a new industry. Put yourself out there. Use social media to learn more about the culture and the skills required. Ask questions and make it fun! Manufacturing isn’t just about the products. It’s about the people, meeting the needs of those across the nation and the world, and creating something beautiful out of ordinary hunks of metal.\xa0 Here’s The Good Stuff!

Guest speakers Mark Terryberry, Bryan O’Fallon, and Scott Gasich share their video-making and content marketing expertise in this fascinating episode of MakingChips! Want to learn what makes a great how-to video and how sharing your knowledge can help boost your business? Listen to the episode to find out!\xa0 Connect with us:www.MakingChips.com/contact Trading manuals for how-to manufacturing videos After a couple of hit how-to YouTube videos demonstrating how to solve simple manufacturing issues, the HAAS Automation marketing team realized that there was no place for manufacturers to go to learn how to do new things or fix things outside of paper manuals. Jumping on the “video craze” bandwagon, they set out to fill the void of immediately available machining instruction by offering quality how-to and product video content.\xa0 Quickly finding that people prefer short, to-the-point videos, the HAAS team created short video series on different topics. They now average 4-5 videos per week with several series from “Tip of the Day” to “Don’t Fear 5-Axis” and the “Machine Tool Coolant Series.” Manufacturers today need quickly available and accurate demonstrations to help them master their art and easily find solutions. YouTube offers the medium that HAAS needs to accomplish its goal of meeting the needs of the manufacturing community while also marketing their latest products.\xa0 Overcoming roadblocks with authenticity\xa0 It can be overwhelming when trying to decide how much production value to put into video content creation. How polished do you make how-to manufacturing videos? Mark, Bryon, and Scott all share the need to be authentic with your audience. Just because you make a video doesn’t mean that people will watch it. Know who you are as a company and know who your customers and potential viewers are. What do they need and want to learn?\xa0 How-to manufacturing videos are a way to build trust with current and potential customers. If you are providing real solutions to real problems, then you will earn the trust of your viewers. Mark, Bryon, and Scott encourage listeners to use real-life machinists in their video production. The authentic empathy that machinists will have with viewer issues will come through in the videos and provide an added layer of reality and authenticity.\xa0 Using the needs of viewers as inspiration\xa0 Listening to your viewers is key! While the manufacturing community may still be pretty old-school, everyone consumes online material, and everyone is looking for answers through mediums such as YouTube. Be sure to read the comments people are leaving in your channel. Provide a phone number and email address so that viewers and customers have a way of reaching out with questions. Use your own company’s mistakes as opportunities for creating new content that demonstrates how to solve the problems you come up against.\xa0 Making the shift from traditional marketing to content marketing\xa0 Scott says that with digital marketing, you have to jump right in and get at it. While print marketing may still claim a slice of your resources, put most of your resources in digital marketing. With $3,000 of Facebook marketing, you can reach a million people. With $3,000 invested in print marketing, you may reach a few thousand. Invest in what works. Don’t know where to start? “Follow your gut,” says Scott. Think about how you would want the material presented to you. “Bet on yourself,” he says. Don’t go spend a fortune on production value right away. Use your phone and some good lighting tools and go from there. Build a script or storyboard to help guide the way.

As the manufacturing industry continues to grow with the demand for fast and excellent production, it is imperative that the proper skills be found, fostered, and taught. Even with the desirable technological sophistication of the modern manufacturing world, young talent isn’t being found quickly enough to fill the gap left by the retirement of the Baby Boomer generation.\xa0 Jim and Jason brainstorm with guest speakers Hernan Ricaurte (Owner of Ricaurte Precision), Brian Grigson (General Manager of Axxis Corporation), and Brain Pendarvis (Owner of Pendarvis Manufacturing) about how manufacturing leaders can take action to influence the next generation of machinists. Be sure to listen to the entire episode to catch the best insights into the real and persisting problem of the manufacturing skills gap!\xa0 Connect with us:www.MakingChips.com/contact Putting a finger on the pulse of the manufacturing skills gap Ricaurte, Grigson, and Pendarvis all agree that the skills gap is certainly a major issue of the modern manufacturing world. The “great wave” is here; the older are retiring and the younger aren’t qualified or aren’t interested. Pendarvis shares the struggle of finding talent skilled in the newest manufacturing technology. Leaders know that you can’t just stick anyone on your CNC machines. While the skills gap is a real and present problem, it doesn’t have to remain that way.\xa0 Changing the perception of manufacturing is the first step. Most high schoolers don’t even know that trade school for CNC machining or similar work is an option. Many still think that they have to go to college to have a meaningful career. Manufacturing, however, offers so much at such little training cost. Building bridges with your community is the first step to closing the skills gap. Give presentations at the local middle and high schools, invite schools to tour your facilities and show them that what they need - and want - in a career can be found in manufacturing. “It’s not always money that people want,” says Grigson. A clean environment, security, incentives, and evident room for company growth are all attributes that can help your business attract young talent.\xa0 Effective training is grounded in effective culture\xa0 Who are you as a company? What is your niche? While there is a skills issue, it is important to only hire the skills that you need. What is your company culture? The culture that you want to foster within your business begins with you as the leader. One challenge created by the skills gap is finding someone who is not only talented but also a good fit within your company. Having more experienced employees shadow and oversee the work of new hires or interns provides the opportunity for not only the skills - but for the culture - to be taught.\xa0 Ricaurte shares the lessons he learned from studying the manufacturing culture of Japanese machinists. Fostering a culture of accountability and excellence if key. Attention to detail, respect for one another, and the willingness to learn are all necessary to an effective workplace Training the younger generation within that culture will help produce the future talent that you need. Don’t forget to listen to the rest of the episode for more insight into fostering effective culture! What makes a great modern machinist?\xa0 It actually depends on the work and skill-set required! With the advancement of technology, the skill sets needed by manufacturers grows more diverse. While not everyone will be adept in all areas of machining, they always need to be willing to learn and grow. Curiosity is a sign of a great future machinist. While genuine curiosity, humility, excellent work ethic, and personal drive are all hard to detect in an interview, they should be attributes that you are striving to discover.\xa0 Running an apprenticeship or internship program at your shop is also a highly effective way to discover and nurture new talent. Involve high schoolers in your company’s growth and demonstrate to them the future possibilities within manufacturing. Hiring part-time can also be a good tactic to see if you and your new employee are a good long-term fit.\xa0 Finding and providing opportunity in unlikely places Your local high school isn’t the only place to find potential future talent to invest in. Underprivileged communities are gold when it comes to finding young people with the passion and drive to try something unconventional - such as attending trade school to learn CNC machining. There are bright, curious minds everywhere! Many kids don’t know that manufacturing is even an option among today’s career paths. Manufacturing leaders need to begin investing in and inspiring the talent and ability of young people.\xa0 Yes, the manufacturing skills gap is a problem, but it’s not insurmountable. Listen to the full episode to learn more about how you can make a difference in inspiring the next generation of manufacturers!\xa0 Here’s The Good Stuff!  Preparing for the retirement of the Baby Boomer generation.\xa0 Do the challenges created by the skills gap affect all parts of the country equally?\xa0 The tie between the skills gap and advancing technology.\xa0 Knowing your niche gives you vision in knowing what talent to pursue.\xa0 The challenges surrounding changing the old perception of manufacturing.\xa0 Different strategies for finding the right fit.\xa0 What you should be looking for in a potential hire.\xa0 What you value may differ with each job opening.\xa0 Creative inspiration for the next generation of manufacturers.\xa0  Tools & Takeaways  2018 Skills Gap Report NTMA Training Centers ProShop ERP Xometry The Boring Bar newsletter: Text CHIPS to 38470  This Week’s Superstar Guests  Hernan Ricaurte on LinkedIn Ricaurte Precision Brian Pendarvis on LinkedIn Pendarvis Manufacturing Brian Grigson on LinkedIn Axxis Corporation  Connect With MakingChips  www.MakingChips.com On Facebook On LinkedIn On Instagram On Twitter On YouTube  Subscribe to Making Chips on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Stitcher, or Spotify | Being a manufacturing leader is difficult, especially if you are a manufacturing entrepreneur! With so many possible opportunities and pitfalls, it can be hard to know how to navigate the small-business world of an entrepreneur. Guest speaker, John Saunders, shares his insight and experience as a leading manufacturing entrepreneur and the ways he has successfully set his business apart and thrived through slow growth.\xa0 Founder and owner of Saunders Machine Works, John is a serial entrepreneur with his hands in multiple jobs, including running the NYC CNC YouTube channel and overseeing the training and manufacturing sides of his small business. His YouTube channel has become a medium to influence, inspire, and encourage aspiring and seasoned machinists in their careers.\xa0 Connect with us:www.MakingChips.com/contact Defining the “why” helps drive the business forward Although he attended college to learn entrepreneurship, John found that his key takeaways came from practical experience in selling and machining. Originally wanting to create a business in order to provide a specific product, he quickly realized that creating an excellent product isn’t the same as creating an excellent business. In order to generate a successful business, you have to know the “why” behind the work and the products created.\xa0 Entrepreneurship isn’t for the faint of heart. John advises that if you are having doubts as to whether or not you really want to work for yourself and jump into the world of paperwork, legality issues, building, training, hiring, producing, and customer service, then you may want to work for someone else for a couple of years. Study how your boss leads and drives their business forward - and then go try it for yourself.\xa0 John’s business - Saunders Machine Works - grew out of his love for CNC machining and sharing its workhorse capability with viewers on YouTube via his NYC CNC channel. Continuing with the YouTube channel, he wanted a business that could also train individuals in machining and sell manufacturing tools and products. The three-part business has kept up steady - yet slow growth - just as John wants it.\xa0 Knowing when to jump at an opportunity and when to say NO Keeping a focus on who you are and why you do what you do helps you to navigate the way forward. Instead of chasing every glittering opportunity, consider whether or not it will help fulfill the goals of your business or help create a better experience for your customers. What you are selling isn’t just the object in the box - it’s the atmosphere, relationship, and experience that you are offering your customers.\xa0 For John, this means finding the best ways to share the modern world of manufacturing with others. His YouTube channel provides a place for machinists of all experience levels to ask questions, easily view videos that demonstrate solutions to popular machining problems, and be a part of the manufacturing community. The training classes that Saunders Machine Works offers provide practical experience in a variety of machining skills and open the door to both young and old to explore manufacturing as a hobby or career. John’s business also values offering internship and apprenticeship-modeled jobs to those who need practical experience through their product manufacturing side of Saunders Machine Works.\xa0 The goal in sorting through opportunities is to make continuous improvements in your processes - to make them as efficient and streamlined as possible - all without wasting resources. Bootstrapping is the ability of your business to leverage your equity for the greatest return on investment. Money and time are ever manufacturing entrepreneur’s most limited resources. In some phases of your business, you may find that you are lower in one of those resources than another. If you have the opportunity to grow in your knowledge and skills as a master of your trade, take them! Don’t be wasteful. Invest with results.\xa0 John’s take on managing growth as a manufacturing entrepreneur “Growth eats cash for breakfast,” John warns. We are trained to think that any growth opportunity is a good opportunity, but it’s wiser and more profitable to consider each one through the lens of your “why.” With such a large following, John often gets calls offering partnerships with other businesses. Due to a poor partnership experience in his early entrepreneurial days, John has decided to never partner with another business. The true 50/50 partnership is rare and often difficult to maintain. That doesn’t mean you should never try it, but know where you want your business to go and maintain integrity with those goals through your growth tactics. Be sure to listen to the entire episode for more insight into making the best growth decisions possible. Creating content that reflects your company’s values and meets your customers’ needs It can be easy for entrepreneurs to become overwhelmed by all the marketing and advertising mediums available. John stresses the importance of only utilizing what you need, what you can afford, and what will speak most authentically to your potential customers. John aligns his content creation with his goal to help others help themselves in their manufacturing stories. Be honest about what you are portraying through social media. Authenticity is a huge factor; make it a point to share the stories that surround the challenges that your business has faced and the solutions that you found. Make note of what you are personally drawn to on social media and study why you like it. At the end of the day, it’s not about you. It’s about your current and potential customers and the quality of what you are offering them.\xa0 Here’s The Good Stuff!

Kurt Preisendanz is the Director of Training at the NTMA Training Centers in Southern California. Passionate about sharing the opportunities that machining has to offer the next generation, Kurt explains the challenges that trade schools face and ways that manufacturing leaders can help lead the charge in alternative higher education. Lee Norton is a board member of the California Manufacturing Workforce Foundation, a 501c3 charity that uses their donations to provide tuition and funding to currently enrolled students who are pursuing technical careers. Be sure to listen to this inspiring and insightful episode to learn more about the amazing option of machining trade schools and how you can make a difference.\xa0 Connect with us:www.MakingChips.com/contact Overcoming the misperception that trade schools aren’t good enough\xa0 Kurt shares the struggles that he faces when representing the NTMA Training Centers at job fairs and high schools. Many parents and teachers push their children towards universities and traditional college paths because they believe those are the best options available. Trade schools are often looked down upon as not good enough for promising students or as a legitimate gateway into a successful career. Kurt explains that this is mostly an American view, as Europe has long viewed learning and mastering a trade as a proper way to begin a career and life as an adult.\xa0 Lee shares that while his children are attending university, they have a clear goal in mind. The problem isn’t that the traditional college route is wrong - it’s that it is often wasted and is perceived as the only path to success. That simply isn’t the case. Both Lee and Kurt believe that low trade school attendance and acceptance has to do with the fact that people simply don’t understand the value of what is being taught. The manufacturing world, especially, is still viewed as the dirty factory work that we all want to avoid and escape. Manufacturing, however, has become one of the most modernized and technological industries in the world. The robotics, engineering, building, and software developed and utilized within the manufacturing industry is extremely cutting-edge. The challenge is to overcome the misperceptions surrounding trade schools and machining and to effectively share the opportunity of a machining certification.\xa0 Machining trade schools offer modern, effective, and exciting opportunities\xa0 Forget the old days of dirty shop floors and being “doomed” to dangerous factory work. The modern world of machining and manufacturing is filled with incredible technology. Kurt explains that while students in machining trade schools are required to learn all the basics of machining, they are exposed to the many specializations that are available, including robotics, CNC machining, inspection, Master CAM, and CMM. Every one of NTMA’s students learns turning and milling and the fundamentals of machining so that they understand how everything is made. The program can be completed in as little as seven months, with daily hands-on instruction. Students graduate with a certification and are guided and encouraged in their job-finding journey. Many leave with job offers and the promise of an exciting and lucrative future.\xa0 Enabling and inspiring the next generation of manufacturing leaders to take action\xa0 Both Kurt and Lee believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel concerning the skills gap in the manufacturing industry. Many are beginning to understand and view a machining career as a valid and exciting opportunity. Kurt ensures that his presentations at job fairs and high schools accurately depict the advanced technological atmosphere that is machining. He shares the diverse culture of the manufacturing world as well. It’s not just men, but women as well, who are finding meaningful work in an industry where their talents are valued. Both young and old are finding new purpose and life in manufacturing. Lee knows that the manufacturing industry is all about giving back. Many who are in the industry grew up in it and have been a part of the Metal Working Nation for generations. Lee and Kurt believe that investing in the next generation of machinists is vital to the health of the industry. Being able to provide scholarships to currently enrolled students in technical fields of study is a huge part of keeping the manufacturing future strong. Be sure to listen to the whole episode for ideas on how you - as a manufacturing leader - can get involved!\xa0 Guiding students’ expectations towards a stable and meaningful future Kurt explains that many of the students who go to the NTMA training centers are excited about the opportunities ahead. Kurt makes sure, however, that they understand the level of hard work required. No, they aren’t going to make 100k in their first couple of years as machinists, but what they do have to look forward to is a lifelong career built on engaging and purposeful work. They can grow as fast as they want in the industry - there’s no limit to what they can learn and accomplish. They are investing in a career that can offer them a sense of pride in their labor and skillset, opportunities in aerospace and government - all while supplying them with a stable career that will enhance their marriage and family life.

Guest speaker, Akshat Thirani, shares how he solved the software disparity between computer engineers and manufacturers and created a tool to enable manufacturing leaders to meet their goals as efficiently as possible. AI isn’t something to fear. Without change - nothing will happen in your business! Connect with us:www.MakingChips.com/contact From India to Chicago: Akshat’s manufacturing journey Growing up in India, Akshat’s childhood was saturated in the manufacturing industry. All of his family and friends had some part in the local manufacturing and production business, and his father raised his children with a manufacturer's mindset. With manufacturing in his blood, Akshat set off for college at the age of 17, studying design engineering and computer software. It was at school that he first noticed the gaping disparity between what computer software engineers were utilizing and what leading manufacturing engineers were using - even though the manufacturers were handling some of the most complex and technical work in the world. Akshat knew he needed to create a tool that would enable manufacturers to work and live to their full potential - a tool that would help them track production time, maintenance, and the data produced by their machines.\xa0 Why manufacturers need to embrace AI and more efficient data collection\xa0 Akshat understood that it was no trivial thing to join an AI tool to a machine and start collecting data. Many shops utilize both old and new machinery - making the job of AI more difficult. Akshat knew that the tool he was creating needed to be simple and able to read the “heartbeat” of each machine and distinguish what job was being completed.\xa0 The “heartbeat” of a machine is the signature electrical current that it produces. During his senior year in college, Akshat and some of his colleagues created the prototype AI tool he had dreamed of. It eventually became the answer to the machinist’s problems with efficient data collection. Instead of jotting down on pieces of paper or having to manually insert data about a machine or job into an Excel spreadsheet, AI can be hooked up to a machine and learn the heartbeat of specific jobs and functions. AI then transmits that data to a centralized, online platform through cellular data - allowing the manufacturing team to quickly read the pulse on their machinery and work.\xa0 Meeting the needs of the Metal Working Nation through artificial intelligence\xa0 Every individual on a manufacturing team has expertise that is wasted when they are required to spend time collecting, recording, and analyzing data from each machine. Instead of having the professionals do the busywork, AI can read, transmit, organize, and analyze the data outsourced by the machinery. Providing real-time data to team members, Akshat’s AI tools can record the speed of each machine being used, which machines need maintenance, the estimated timetable for a piece or job, and the reasons why a machine is not running at optimum capacity. Meeting the core manufacturing goals of simplicity and practicality, AI is something that the leaders of the Metal Working Nation need to be taking seriously and educating themselves on.\xa0 Ensuring that your technology fits your company goals \xa0Every manufacturing business will have different long-term goals and immediate needs. Akshat encourages listeners to walk through their shops and talk with their team members to identify what needs to be accomplished through an AI tool such as Akshat’s. Calculating the cost of integrating AI into the system may be surprisingly less than what is being spent on manual data collection. Identify what you need to accomplish work more efficiently - and then make it happen. Because if you’re not making chips, you’re not making money!\xa0 Here’s The Good Stuff!  If you don’t change, nothing will happen.\xa0 Artificial intelligence is helping manufacturers pave the way forward.\xa0 Guest speaker Akshat Thirani - CEO of Amper Technologies.\xa0 Akshat’s love for manufacturing is a generational story.\xa0 Solving the disparity between online software and manufacturing tools.\xa0 Solving the code of machinery heartbeats.\xa0 Creating a more efficient workspace for all members of the team.\xa0 Know what the goal is - then take action.\xa0  Tools & Takeaways  Xometry Supplies ProShop ERP How AI and IIoT Will Provide Insights to Manufacturers   Text CHIPS to 38470 to subscribe to The Boring Bar newsletter  This Week’s Superstar Guest: Akshat Thirani  Amper Technologies, Inc.

Guest speakers Randy Jokerst and Brad Klippstein share how the THINC Developers Group enables the Metal Working Nation to perform at its best by solving manufacturing leaders’ problems through innovation.\xa0 Randy is the Director of Technical Services at Hartwig Inc. and one of the founding members of the THINC Development Group. Entering the manufacturing world by way of CNC engineering, he has used his gifting in engineering to amp up machinist’s efficiency by implementing automation systems into new machines. Also an engineer, Brad Klippstein is the Supervisor of the Okuma Product Specialist Group. His manufacturing journey began when he visited a machine tool fair fresh out of college and was asked if he wanted to program robots. Hooked, Brad dove into developing new technology and applications at the forefront of the programming world.\xa0 Connect with us:www.MakingChips.com/contact The THINC Developers Group brainstorms the automation systems of the future\xa0 Having trouble creating efficient processes or closing the skills gap of the next manufacturing generation? Founded in 2008, the THINC Developers Group was created to solve the issues of the Metal Working Nation and provide the cutting-edge applications needed to automate manufacturing systems. The THINC control for machining systems was originally PC-based, and while the developers understood how to navigate and decipher the data collected by the control, most users were unable to view what the control was collecting. The development group was created to enable customers to build their own control interface apps so that they could use the control system to meet their unique needs. The THINC group’s focus is on the communication between the machine tool side and the PC side - teaching people to write the apps to accomplish their machining goals.\xa0 The Okuma Sampling Path utilizes automation systems for optimal efficiency\xa0 Better efficiency is something manufacturing leaders are constantly working towards. One way to improve efficiency while also pouring into your team’s adaptability and performance is to automate the jobs that take away from time that your team can spend in their specific areas of expertise. Limiting distractions by utilizing automation systems to set and send reminders can also boost efficiency levels. Randy talks about how one of the U.S. mints had three separate operations that moved parts from one machine to the next to make the coin dies. Using an automation system developed by the THINC group, they were able to combine their operations into a three-machine/one robot cell that produced all the parts within hours instead of days.\xa0 Many of Okuma Inc.’s developments have come from the THINC Developers Group. Through the MyOkuma app, you can integrate the Okuma tools into your systems. Compatible with many different PC systems, the THINC Developers Group plays in the sandbox of the Application Program Interface (API), creating communication points between machines. The vision and goals of the customer are brought into being through the innovation of THINC and executed through their developments via the Okuma Sampling Path.\xa0 Brad explains that at Okuma, through the Okuma Sampling Path, they can read, write, and access thousands of data points within the controls of systems and machines. They can make the control do whatever the customer needs through the API. All of the solutions data can be viewed and interpreted by the customers so that they can make the best business decisions based upon the data provided.\xa0 Communicating between machines with MTConnect\xa0 MTConnect takes the guessing work out of machine data interpretation. Okuma machine tools and the Okuma control collect their machining data from MTConnect, which harvests data straight from the CNC machines, interprets it, and sends it to the Okuma control. Manufacturers have access to this data through their own Okuma controls because MTConnect is already attached to the control from the moment it hits the shop floor. MTConnect allows you to take all the information processed and pull it up via the data stream to your phone, tablet, or computer. With Okuma controls, there is no additional fee for MTConnect. Because it is sent via data stream to your devices, you can access necessary data even while offline.\xa0 Streamlining automation systems to meet your unique goals\xa0 Reading exuberant amounts of data can be overwhelming, which is why the THINC Developers Group created several unique dashboard bases to meet the different needs of manufacturing leaders and their teams. Streamlining your automation systems by utilizing a central dashboard for data collection and interpretation will enable you to view and make decisions more quickly. Instead of manually checking on the tools and machines being used and recording the health, run-time, and down-time of your tools, you can see all of that data displayed on a single dashboard. The idea is to create a condition-based, automated environment that allows you to be as hands-off as possible with the menial work required to run your business. Automation systems are all about keeping it simple and clarifying communication between your team and machines.\xa0 Remember! Text CHIPS to 38470 to subscribe to The Boring Bar newsletter!

Wanting maximum control of his own schedule as well as his team’s, Craig began researching the impact that cobots can have on improving efficiency and helping to close the skills gap. Encouraged by his team to pursue a future in cobotics, he began implementing them into his workforce. The impact was so powerful that Craig and his team at Fusion OEM were inspired to create their own line of cobotics.\xa0 Collaborative robots - cobots - are designed to operate around people and often with people. Not only can they help you eliminate the menial tasks that take up your team’s valuable and limited time, but they can also help keep integration and employee turnover costs low. Cobots are easily taught by those working in their space. There is no need for a cobotics consultant to train it in every new function. Using cobots to fulfill repetitive and menial work frees up your team to focus on areas of work that require their expertise - allowing them to grow in their knowledge and application instead of being bogged down by time-consuming tasks.\xa0 Eliminating the dull, dirty, and dangerous\xa0 Craig explains that knowing where and how to utilize cobots can be overwhelming to those who are first installing them. He encourages listeners to focus on the jobs on the shop floor that are dull, dirty, or dangerous and to begin implementing cobots in those tasks. Cobots are especially helpful in highly repetitive work because they don’t slow down or speed up as a human would throughout the day. The consistent speed and functionality of the cobot allows for more predictable output timetables and eliminates the dull work that keeps your team tied. Deburring, polishing, sanding, quality inspection, sensing, and making/recording measurements are all tasks that a cobot can accomplish - freeing you and your machinists to focus on what really matters.\xa0 Investing in your team’s expertise by investing in cobotics Training up the new generation of manufacturing leaders and machinists is incredibly important, especially when considering the huge portion of the current manufacturing labor force that is made up of baby boomers. Planning for the turnover that comes with retirements can be made smoother by implementing cobots into your workforce. While training new employees, cobots can cover tasks left by retired machinists and keep your output steady. Cobots also allow you to put more time and energy into training new employees and seasoned team members in new skills. The skills gap dilemma doesn’t have to slow your business. Using cobots can not only help you close that skills gap but make your production time more efficient while doing so.\xa0 Educating yourself in the cobotic ecosystem Jumping into cobotics implementation and utilization can be intimidating. Craig encourages listeners to take small steps and to familiarize themselves with what the cobotic ecosystem is all about. Visiting manufacturing shops and production lines that use cobots will allow you to see for yourself what they can accomplish. Find easy wins for cobotics within your own workforce. Test out cobots on jobs that you know you could use them in. Cobotics is a paradigm shift, but it doesn’t have to be a difficult one. Chip away at the automation transition and watch your business grow!\xa0 Here’s The Good Stuff!

Even though the industry has a history of sticking with what has worked for generations, it is now time to invest in the future by equipping and inspiring manufacturing leaders and teams to educate themselves on the progress of technology and process. Guest speaker, Drura Parrish, the president of Xometry Supplies, shares his manufacturing story and how leaders can take small steps towards big change for their businesses. Connect with us:www.MakingChips.com/contact “We’ve always done it this way” is no longer a valid mantra Growing up in the manufacturing world, Drura noticed that his grandfather’s business philosophy was built more upon hope in the future than on making that future himself with the manufacturing tools he owned. The machines that spent their lives unused - waiting for the “big deal,” caused Drura to question the processes in place. However, when he came back after college, he went to work for his grandfather and learned the important lesson of knowing when to ask why you are doing something before you set out to do it. Accepting a process because it has “always” been used isn’t a good enough reason to keep on using it. Be sure to listen to the episode for Drura’s personal experience in learning to ask “Why?”\xa0 Change in manufacturing begins with leadership It’s all about leadership. Drura explains that in many machine shops, the leader is often the one with the most expertise and experience in a specific field. But is that the way it should be? In today’s modern manufacturing world, everyone is an expert at something. People need leaders, but they don’t necessarily need a leader who is well-versed in every aspect of the manufacturing business. Instead, the leader needs to be the one asking questions - asking, “Why are we doing it this way?” Drura believes that it is the responsibility of the 21st-century manufacturing leader to instill in their team the mindset that the customer is always right and to provide the training their team needs to accomplish serving their customers well. Outdated software? Toss it out. Equip your people; instill in them a positive, service-minded attitude, and trust your people to produce a quality outcome.\xa0 Commit to the technological education of your people\xa0 Do your people know how to identify good technology? Drura explains that in a world that is saturated in options and new technology, it is vital that your team understand what makes good technology and what makes a good process. Jason and Jim both agree that while it is difficult to begin setting aside time in your business’s schedule for training and education of the team, it is essential to your company’s future success. Technology must be taken seriously in today’s manufacturing world.\xa0 What educating a manufacturing team looks like will depend on the individual business, the people, and the goals of the company. For smaller shops, it may be investing in one individual at a time instead of collectively training in new technology. For very large businesses, it could mean taking another, smaller shop under their wing and helping guide them in good business acumen. The idea is to promote in the Metal Working Nation an attitude of growth and effective change. When progressive change is made, take the time to celebrate!\xa0 Change is made one step at a time Jim, Jason, and Drura all know that change in manufacturing can be a slow process. But small progress is better than no progress! Drura suggests setting aside 1% of your time as a leader and business to invest in education. As your team explores the latest innovations in their area of expertise, they will grow in their own skills - making your business more efficient. Spending time training actually saves you time as a business in the long run. Equip your people. Inspire them to always be asking “Why?” Start with 1%, and grow from there. Change is the pathway to future success.\xa0 Here’s The Good Stuff!  Robots replacing humans in the manufacturing world may actually be a good thing.\xa0 Guest speaker, Drura Parrish - president of Xometry Supplies.\xa0 Learning to ask “why?” from Drura's grandfather.\xa0 Knowing where to implement change and how to go about starting it.\xa0 Taking responsibility for change as a leader.\xa0 The vital necessity of educating your people on the latest technology.\xa0 Investing time in the education of your team will save you time in the long run.\xa0 Make it a goal to elevate fellow manufacturing businesses.\xa0 Xometry’s goal to spark the entrepreneurial spirit in manufacturers.

How can we recruit great talent that will ultimately allow us to step out of some roles? What role does training play in growing our businesses, and what value can we offer agents to ensure they stay on our teams? On this episode, team owner at Lincoln Select Real Estate Group, Matt Mick shares how he used the three pillars of growth to boost his business. Takeaways + Tactics Recruiting talent is vital when growing a business. If we’re not good at recruiting by ourselves, we should partner up with people who can connect well with recruits. Training should always be prioritized. Ensure agents are constantly learning as they go by providing them with access to educational resources and training sessions.Retain talent by offering value. To keep agents on our teams, hire a transaction coordinator and an ISA to assist them. Teams are the cornerstone of successful brokerages, so it’s important that we hire the best agents we can, and invest in them as much as possible. We have to offer our agents so much value that they’re able to outgrow us, but choose to stay on the team that invested in them. Growth is crucial for success, but for that to happen we must build effective, well-trained teams.  | Hosting events is a great way for us to generate leads and increase our spheres of influence. What mistakes are we making when throwing events, and how many functions should we be hosting every year? How can we use appreciation parties to benefit not only us, but our partners as well? On this episode, author, speaker and entrepreneur Michael Maher shares why we need to host more events, more frequently. Takeaways + Tactics One of the biggest mistakes we make is not hosting events at all. We should be hosting parties for our clients; prospective and existing alike.Hosting just one function is not enough. To gain momentum and keep our clients’ attention, we should aim to host 3-4 events every year. There are opportunities for networking in client appreciation parties where our lenders, warranty and inspection partners are present. Both we and our partners can gain referrals from successful events.To generate excitement around our businesses, we need to offer our clients and target market something special. Hosting events is a great way to do this. Not only does it give us an opportunity to meet prospective clients and build lasting relationships with existing customers, but it also gives our partners a chance to network. We need to host events frequently, and see them as an opportunity to build relationships and get referrals.  | Often the reason we’re not seeing major results in our businesses is because we don’t know the steps we should be taking to get to the next point. If we want to maximize our success, we need to use methods that pay attention to multiple areas. Why is culture such an important element of our businesses? How should we approach lead generation and conversion in order to maximize our success? On this episode, we learn how the CLASS method can take us from 70 deals a year to 700 a year. Takeaways + Tactics Invest in your team and create a great company culture. By helping our agents on their journeys, we can retain top talent and get more business. Find a CRM that works, and don’t focus on cost. While top CRMs like Boomtown may be more expensive, the results we’ll see are definitely worth it.When converting leads, treat them all the same way. Conversion doesn’t apply to internet leads any more than it does to prospecting or sphere leads.At the start of the episode, we heard about the importance of mindset and why success in real estate is dependent on a passion for serving not only our clients, but our agents. We then discussed why we need to be willing to put ourselves in uncomfortable situations if we want to see great results. We also learned:\xa0Why team leaders are responsible for holding agents accountableWhich systems we can use for follow-ups with leadsThe strategies we can implement to serve our agentsTo take our businesses to the next level, we need to have methods in place to help us. This method should include instilling the best company culture for our needs- something that reflects us as team leaders. We also need to be willing to invest- whether in our businesses, our lead generation and conversion processes or in our agents themselves. Investment is crucial for success.  | A lot of broker owners struggle to see their businesses overcome stagnation. How can we grow our teams - and our businesses - faster? How can we recruit the best talent possible for every role in our businesses, and can we use social media to boost our results? On this episode, real estate educator and broker owner, Mike Mazyck shares the 3 pillars of successful growth.\xa0Takeaways + Tactics Hire the right leadership. One bad egg can have devastating effects on our businesses - especially if that bad egg is in a leadership role.Share video content through social media everyday. By offering free content that highlights our core values, we can recruit those whose core purposes match ours.Consider gamification. Offering incentives for agents to recruit in a fun way makes goals more achievable.\xa0\xa0At the start of the episode, we discussed why it’s so important to foster great teams - no matter the size of our brokerages. We explained that without team dynamics in place, brokerages will fail to stay relevant and ultimately stagnate. We also learned:\xa0The information we should be sharing in our online marketingThe value of creating partnerships with our agentsA bonus fourth pillar of growth - salaried agent modelsStagnation is something most business owners have dealt with at some point, and to surpass it we need to implement tried-and-tested strategies. Teams are the most important part of any business, so to grow our results we need to recruit the best talent for every position we offer. By offering incentives to our recruits and existing agents alike, we’ll not only start seeing the results we need: we may even have too much growth to handle.Guest Bio- Mike Mazyck is the founder of Mike Mazyck Realty; a high-powered residential real estate team that services the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and surrounding areas.

What different types of investment should we consider? Which is the best option, and how can we determine the most relevant strategy for our needs and abilities? On this jam-packed episode, co-owner of Dynamic Properties, Clint Bartlett shares the best strategies for real estate investment. Takeaways + Tactics Entry-level investors should consider wholesaling: acquire a property under contract and reassign it to the end buyer - then charge an assignment fee. When flipping properties, keep renovations minimal. Investors might also opt for ‘wholetailing’- cleaning up properties for under $1,000 before listing them.Holding the right properties in great neighborhoods and using them as rentals should be our end goal. At the start of the episode, we discussed why real estate investing is effective for creating passive wealth. We also discussed when it’s best to pass on certain properties - like if there’s too much work involved or it’s not financially viable.We also learned:The necessary team members for a successful investing businessThe top 8 mediums for finding dealsHow to fund dealsThere are many options for team leaders who are interested in real estate investing - we just need to find what fits best for our businesses. Some options - like wholesaling - are more appropriate strategies for entry-level investors; while holding rental properties should be an end goal for us all. The great thing about the key investing strategies is, once we master them, they become easily replicable and can help us generate passive wealth for years to come. \xa0Guest Bio- Clint Bartlett is the co-owner of Dynamic Properties, alongside Jeff Cohn. He first entered the real estate investment space when he decided he wanted to acquire passive wealth. After ensuring there was enough in the pipeline to justify leaving his corporate job, Clint made the jump to real estate investing, and he hasn’t looked back since.To connect with Clint on social media, find him on Instagram under @theclintbartlett.\xa0Join us, Monday, September 23 - 24, 2019, for The Team Building Workshop and The ERS Investor Workshop For the first time ever, this September and October, we are offering The Team Building Workshop and ERS Investor Workshop.

How can we create systems that allow us to train and lead our team with less time and effort? How can we uplift our internal leaders in the process? How can we ensure accountability of our agents? On this episode, Success Manager and ERS Elite Coach Andy Kueny explains how video recordings of training sessions and subject matter experts can be used to scale our teams. Takeaways + Tactics Anything that forms a part of the process in our business should be documented through video. These videos can be easily shared with the rest of our team for years to come.Have full-time agents record trainings of their own. This not only leverages their time, but also raises them up as subject matter experts. \xa0For accountability, quiz team members on the content of the videos. \xa0With so much technology at our fingertips, there’s no reason we shouldn’t be leveraging our time and knowledge. Take advantage of platforms like Google Drive and do away with time-consuming activities that could easily be recorded once and shared multiple times.\xa0To sign up for the Elite Real Estate Systems workshops, visit https://www.eliterealestatesystems.com/Links mentioned in the episode: Omahaseliterealestate.comJeffsbusinessplan.com | To transition from business owner to CEO, we need to put certain pieces in place. What steps did we put in place to go from 70 to 700 deals a year in 6 years? What steps can any real estate team owner replicate in their own business? On this episode, we talk about the 4 things we need to build and scale a dominant real estate team.Takeaways + Tactics The number one thing that will attract new agents is leads. If we create a good enough incentive for them to work the leads, that can allow us to earn money while easing ourselves out of production. The national average of internet lead conversion is less than 1%, but any team can raise their lead conversion to 2-3%. They key is installing the right systems.Inspect what you expect. Agents needs regular communication, support and accountability before we can expect them to work any leads correctly. Teach agents to treat leads from all sources with the same level of care and follow up - even referrals from family and friends.\xa0Growing a successful and dominant real estate company isn’t complicated, and there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. We need the simple processes of lead generation, conversion, coaching and accountability; and if we take the time to be intentional and implement these pillars, we can build a powerful real estate team that gives us high income and high degree of freedom.

Where can we invest without putting ourselves at risk? How can we get started with real estate investing? On this episode, Kristy Moore of Local Expert Realty in Washington D.C. shares how she brought her business back to the top after losing everything.\xa0Takeaways + Tactics Invest money in real estate. If we buy property today, with 2019 money, in a few year’s time it will be worth more.If we don’t want to sell our assets, we should follow the BRRR strategy- Buy, Renovate, Refinance, Repeat. This is a great option, as refinancing has no tax implications.\xa0We can educate ourselves on real estate investing and join a community of investors. There are so many ways to learn about strategies online and in local communities in every market.At the start of the episode, Kristy explained her hiring process and shared what her current team looks like. She also explained that her business is in the early stages of scaling again, so paying attention to who was on the team was crucial. We also learned:Why we should know exactly who you’re looking for, before advertising a positionThe challenges and benefits of having a virtual teamWhere we should be looking for new team members\xa0Real estate is one of the best places to invest money- especially if we’re worried about uncertainty and risk.

How should we structure this type of team? How can we make sure our employees are producing enough return? How can we motivate our employees to stay when they become top producers? In this episode, Kay Houghton discusses how we can manage and retain a successful team of employed agents by offering security, training and incentives, and shares what she did to get to $70 million in just three years.Takeaways + Tactics When we give people job security and the incentive to earn bonuses when they produce more, they’re happier at work, our retention rates are higher and people work harder to earn those bonuses.When we run our company like an actual business with employees, we need to make sure that our people are producing otherwise we’re losing money. By giving our employees the training and support they need to generate profit, we can determine who to retain and who to let go of based on the return they’re making. By hiring a strong administrative team before taking on any agents, we make sure that we have the right foundation to bring agents onto our team. This also allows us to scale our business more effectively as agents have access to the support staff and resources they need to produce. On this episode we discussed how Kay Houghton structured her team of agents as full-time employees, and how she manages to create an environment of support and incentives so that they are happy and generating profit. Kay also shares her top strategies for farm real estate. We also discussed:How to give agents job satisfactionHow to ensure we have a high-producing teamWhy we need an administrative team first\xa0Being an agent can be an inconsistent and unstable job when we work mainly as independent contractors dependent on commissions and the state of the market. However, the traditional team structure is proving to be less and less effective because the mindset is now centered around running a business. This means that team leaders need to make sure that agents are generating profit, otherwise they’re losing money. By setting up our teams as employees and offering stability, support and benefits as well as incentivized bonuses, we can make sure that we have a happy and high-producing team. Guest Bio- Kay Houghton, Owner and Realtor of Kay Houghton & Associates, is set to close almost $70 million with a team of seven people after being in the industry for only three-and-a-half years. Kay worked as a National Sales Director for ten years and then left her job in 2015 to become a residential real estate agent with Keller Williams Realty. After just three years, she became a top-producing agent, closing transactions throughout Virginia, DC, and Maryland. Kay believes that knowledge is power and she works to give her clients the information necessary to make the best decisions throughout the buying process. In 2016, Kay Houghton & Associates was launched to meet the needs of Kay’s expanding client base. Her company is centered around one guiding principle: It’s all about you. Your needs. Your dreams. Your concerns. Your questions. Your finances. Your time. Your life. Their focus is on complete client satisfaction. \xa0https://khassociates.com/ | Most Real Estate team leaders would agree that there’s a significant shortage of agents in the market. How can we hire more team members to ensure we keep up with the high number of leads? What’s the best way to approach the recruitment process? On this episode, interview expert and Bestselling author, John Pyke shares his insights on recruiting more effectively.\xa0Takeaways + TacticsStop relying on the face-to-face interview so much. While meeting someone in person is helpful in assessing their values and personality, the information we’ll get is only surface-level. The interview is merely the tip of the iceberg.Look for sales DNA. Research has shown that some people’s brains are hardwired in a way that benefits sales. For those who don’t have the DNA, no amount of training will push them to become top producers.Recruit existing agents who are already licensed. As soon as an agent has the foundation, they’ll be more easily molded by any training you provide.\xa0There is no shortage of leads at the moment, but there simply aren’t enough agents to work on them. It’s vital that as team leaders we hire agents that stay with the team for long enough, and who exhibit the right talents. The only way this can be done is by focusing on the bottom of the iceberg- that is, more than personality.\xa0Guest Bio-\xa0John Pyke is an Assessment and Peak Performance expert at The Talent Genius.

This week we talk about how to recognize burnout with its multifaceted features. | After a long hiatus, the Business of Dentistry is back.\xa0 As a re-launch episode, I figured we would start off talking everyone\'s favorite - hate mail.\xa0 \xa0 | Outside of my family, the two things that I’m the most comfortable and passionate talking about are dentistry and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Today I want to share with all of you a few thoughts on the lessons I’ve learned after losing a match during the jiu-jitsu tournament I had signed up for. My experience there taught me a few important things, and I later realized that these things can also translate well to my practice. So I will use these lessons in the future, both on a business and a jiu-jitsu side. When you have something go wrong, I strongly encourage you to not just quit on the first try. It may be something that will work in the future. Reorganize, regroup, come back and try it again. Key takeaways:  Doing something a little uncomfortable to get out of your comfort zone Prepare, have a strategy, be ready to adjust and shift things Take ownership, give credit where credit is due, and work harder the next time  | Today I have a very short episode for you. It’s all about rekindling the excitement and the fire by trying something new. I know that I haven’t posted anything in awhile, but I needed some time in order to breathe, recharge, and think deeper. Now I’m back and I’ll be having some pretty exciting guests coming on the show, so stay tuned! Key takeaways:  Doing something new and exciting Taking yourself out of stagnant, dormant waters, and refreshing your mindset  | Reese Harper is the founder of DentistAdvisors.com. He started working in the financial service industry in 2003, and had several business owner clients. Over time, he realized that dental practice owners were really different from the rest. Compared to his other clients, dental practice owners had a lot more financial questions, and seemed to be carrying more financial anxiety and stress. So Reese figured out that the generic solutions that the financial planning industry were providing to dentists were just not meeting their needs. Dental practice owners had a more complex financial picture, and that made him choose to work exclusively with them now.  Key takeaways:  Reevaluate your financial plan every year and make adjustments How much wealth do you need to have in order to make work optional? Avoid cash holdings, renegotiate your debt, and borrow against your own investments  Links:  Dentist Advisors  Elements® Comprehensive Financial Planning  The Dentist Money Show Podcast ', 'chan_desc': 'Dr. Russell Kirk is a private practice oral surgeon who is on a mission to help dentists succeed in the business and clinical aspects of practice ownership.

What we do know is we are stressed, have never-ending to-do lists, and have trouble focusing on what needs to get done in order to achieve our goals.\xa0 In this episode of The Sassy Strategist Podcast, Founder of Win The Hour, Win The Day, Kris Ward and I talk about how you can be more productive in your business, with less time and stress by learning how to use time blocking. We also discuss why To-Do lists don’t work, and can actually keep you from achieving your goals.\xa0 As someone who struggles with time management myself, I appreciated having Kris weigh in on how we can all manage our time better, so business can be more fun, and less stressful.\xa0 \xa0 “It’s not how much time you put in, it’s what you produce” - Kris Ward \xa0 Solopreneurs and small business owners have a lot of their plates, and often DIY a lot of tasks, which can lead to being overwhelmed, and unproductive. Learn how to control your time, and not let it control you. Listen in for more! Key Points to Ponder  Time blocking helps you avoid procrastination, gain more focus, and help you execute your action plan. Checking emails later in the day, rather than first thing, can help you be more productive\xa0\xa0\xa0 Time blocking can help you avoid Shiny Object Syndrome It isn’t how hard you work that matters, or how many items you check off your to-do list  Mentioned in this episode   Win The Hour, Win The Day Book by Kris Ward Win The Hour, Win The Day Time Management Program Trello Slack  About Kris Ward Kris Ward is the founder of Win The Hour, Win the Day, both a platform and Amazon best-selling book, that helps entrepreneurs to systematically grow their business and, oh, by the way, enjoy a personal life too.

Do you know how to be successful by sticking to your niche, and saying “no” to clients who are all wrong for you? In this episode of The Sassy Strategist, Moira Thompson & Natalie Pinney of Whim Events share with us how they created a niche, boosted sales, and became a leader in their industry. We talk about how taking risks and being honest about who you really want to work with, as well as differentiating yourself from the competition, helped them build a high-end, luxury wedding planning, floral and design company, winning  Boston Magazine’s “Best of Boston” for Best Wedding & Event Planner in 2018. Natalie & Moira share their amazing story of how they found each other and created a wildly successful business, along with what they’ve learned, and the mistakes they’ve made along the way. Listen in for more! Key Points to Ponder  There’s a difference between a niche market and a niche service. If you create a niche market, but offer a wide range of services, you can maximize your profitability. Entering a higher-price point market can be scary, but will typically lead to greater success for the solopreneur or microbusiness owner. In a highly-competitive industry, leverage your competition rather than fear it. Larger projects might be better than smaller projects, as they can be more profitable and less time consuming. More projects aren’t always better, either.  Mentioned in this episode  The B List Best of Boston, Boston Magazine  About Whim Events Once upon a time, a dreamy floral designer met a spreadsheet-obsessed event planner. It was the perfect match. Together over a lot of coffee, crazy ideas and a mutual love for making people’s dreams come true, Moira Thompson & Natalie Pinney founded Whim Events in 2011. Whim Events has since blossomed into one of Boston’s leading full-service wedding planning, event design and floral studios. With over ten years of experience, we specialize in joyfully and thoughtfully guiding couples through every stage of the engagement. From scouting your ideal venue to curating well-crafted, intelligent design pieces that hone in on your life together, our team treats each wedding day with the utmost love & care. Whim has been named one of New England’s Top Wedding Planners by My Weddings Magazine, awarded Boston’s Best Wedding Planner by the Improper Bostonian, and voted one of Boston’s Top 5 Florists on the Boston A-List. \xa0 | You’ve heard that personal brands are the way to go if you want to build a thriving online business. But what does that even mean? And how do you present that personal brand online if you’re introverted and reluctant to put yourself out there? \xa0 In this episode of The Sassy Strategist, brand photographer Melissa Henry shares with us the ins and outs of creating a personal brand that stands out. We talk about how to present yourself online, when (if ever) to use stock photography and whether a highly curated Instagram feed is even worth it. \xa0 As someone who is reluctant to share too much online, I appreciated having Melissa weigh in on the fine line between talking about yourself and oversharing. \xa0 “Are you using social media to have fun? Or are you using social media to grow your business?” - Melissa Henry \xa0 You need to be present online if you’re running any kind of business these days, but it’s okay to take a step back and do it in a way that makes you comfortable, rather than how someone else tells you that you “need” to do it. Listen in for more! \xa0 Key Points to Ponder  Selfies can play a role in your social posts, but they shouldn’t be everything. Your social media images should reflect your brand, not what you’re doing all day, every day. Stock images that look like everyone else’s may devalue your brand. Is it the words or the images that make your posts work?  \xa0 Mentioned in this episode  Brand Initiative Group  Get Visible, Grow Your Biz  | Relationships are a necessary part of business growth because your content is only going to take you so far. Yes, content is important and yes, so is SEO. But people want to buy from people in our micro economy--not from logos and brands. In this episode of The Sassy Strategist, I’m talking to Abby Herman of Write Solutions about relationship marketing and how to put yourself out there in a way that feels good to you--and helps you grow your business. You need to put yourself out there, even if you’re an introvert. It’s not as difficult as you think and could be as simple as switching up your profile picture on your social media accounts and responding to people via direct message on Instagram. “The more you reach out to people and interact with them, the more you’re going to grow your business.” - Abby Herman Marketing yourself is a huge part of your job as a business owner, and that goes far beyond creating content. Whether you’re struggling with business growth or not, this episode will help you with how to take the next steps to grow relationships so you can thrive in business. \xa0 Key Points to Ponder  Content, SEO and referrals will only get you so far. People buy from people, not from logos and brands. No matter what you’re sharing online, you can always make a shift if you find that people aren’t responding to your content. People struggle with starting the relationship in the first place because it feels uncomfortable.

Relationship Marketing in the Digital Age. | Do you struggle saying "no" in your business? Whether it\'s saying no to potential clients you don\'t want to work with, or so-called "opportunities" that are more hassle than they\'re worth, learn four effective strategies for saying "no", and start saying "yes" to spending your time and business effort how you see fit. Be sure to listen in if you\'re feeling overwhelmed and stressed about your schedule, about working with clients whom you don\'t really want to work with, or if you simply need practical strategies and techniques for saying "no" to anything that doesn\'t align with your business vision, or help you achieve your goals. Key Points to Ponder  - It\'s easier to say "no" if you already have a plan in place outlining your business goals and what you want to achieve.  - Having a weekly, and even daily, schedule for your business is crucial for avoiding too many "yeses" on your calendar.  - You shouldn\'t dismiss personality conflicts when considering new clients.  - It can damage your brand and reputation if you say "yes" to opportunities that don\'t align with your values and beliefs.

But that doesn’t mean you create content and throw it on your site. You need search engine optimization (SEO) so that Google can find you. I’m talking to Meg Clarke of Clapping Dog Media this week on The Sassy Strategist, and she’s sharing her insight into why SEO doesn’t need to be that confusing, overwhelming beast so many of us think it is. Like any other part of our business, we need to be strategic about how we think about our content so you can get the ROI you want out of your website. “Put a megaphone up to your website so the content you have and the content you’re writing goes further, faster.” - Meg Clarke In this episode, we talk about where to begin if you’re just starting out with SEO, why SEO is so important even when most of your business comes from referrals, the kind of content you need on your site and some easy fixes you can make to make your website more Google-friendly today. About Meg Clarke Meg is an SEO expert and the owner and founder of Clapping Dog Media. She focuses on creating functional websites using keyword analytics, site simplicity and her own personal experience to help her clients run successful online businesses. In addition, Meg specializes in communication, ensuring her customers learn and understand the SEO strategies with which she provides them so they leave Clapping Dog’s services feeling empowered in their businesses. Follow her on Instagram and  YouTube. \xa0 Key Points to Ponder:  Know what you want to be known for so you can be more strategic with your content. You need the right balance on your About page so Google will pay attention. Google has the biggest pool of potential clients, hands-down. Google Analytics are important but there are only a few key things you should be tracking as the business owner.  | When service-based business owners want to grow but they’ve maxed out the amount of time they can spend on their businesses, they look to scaling. One way to do that is to build an app that offers a perk for their client base--or saves the business owner time or money. \xa0 This week on The Sassy Strategist, I’m talking with Tim Bornholdt of The Jed Mahonis Group, an agency that works with business owners on designing and developing custom mobile apps. \xa0 You might be thinking, But I offer a one-to-one service; an app won’t help me. What I discovered as I talked to Tim is that’s not true at all. \xa0 There are so many different opportunities for even service-based businesses to scale with the development of an app. \xa0 In this episode, we talk about the development process, how to do due diligence before investing, how to market a new app and both the time and financial investment involved in adding a mobile app to your business model. \xa0 About Tim Bornholdt Tim Bornholdt is a co-founder of The Jed Mahonis Group, where he helps businesses strategize, design, develop, and deploy custom iOS and Android mobile applications. His firm has partnered with many startups and large brands over the years to deliver software that is used by millions of people around the world. You can connect with him on LinkedIn or follow The Jed Mahonis Group on Facebook. \xa0 Key Points to Ponder  Working with professionals allows them to give additional feedback and ideas to make your app even better. Hiring an agency means that all the players will work in synergy. When you work with multiple developers for different platforms, that’s not always the case. Some apps will naturally be more profitable than others. It’s all about execution from the business side of things. Developing an app is a lot like building a house. The ones with more bells and whistles will cost more.  \xa0 | Is writing a book on your 2019 bucket list? A lot of small business owners are using books to help market their businesses. It’s a great product to use as proof that you know your stuff and to use as a back-table sale at the end of an in-person speaking gig. But it’s a much bigger project than most business owners know. I learned a lot of lessons throughout the process, which I share with you in today’s episode of The Sassy Strategist podcast. I’ll give you feedback and tips on what to expect as well as my biggest regret. I’ll share with you why I decided to go the self-publishing route, why an editor is such an integral part of the process and when to get help on board for editing, design and marketing. Be sure to listen in if a book is on your list--either now or in the future. Key Points to Ponder  You are not a book editor; you need to find one to help you through the process. You’ll write things that feel natural to you, but there’s a more succinct and impactful way to say it. Life gets in the way of writing a book. Get on the calendar of your editor and designer early. If you simply say, “I’m going to write a book,” you’re never going to write a book. You need a schedule. Writing the book is one thing, but there was so much more work after the first draft! Marketing a book is very different from marketing a business. Not everyone wants to read a book on Kindle. Consider a printed paperback as well.  Mentioned in this episode  The editor I worked with as I wrote my book was Jodi Brandon of Jodi Brandon Editorial The book designer I worked with as I wrote my book was Melody Christian of Finicky Designs. Ingramspark Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)  Passion to Profits: Your Guide to Building a Successful Business You Love  \xa0 | It’s one of the most-talked about topics in small business. You don’t want to charge too much, for fear that you’ll scare prospective clients away. You don’t want to charge too little because you won’t be profitable. It’s time to take the emotion and stress away from pricing and to start thinking about it from a more strategic place. On this episode of The Sassy Strategist, I’m talking about one of my favorite topics, pricing your services for profits. In it, I’ll give you the three-step process that must go into calculating your pricing and tell you why you’re doing yourself and your business a disservice if you’re not pricing correctly. This episode is truly an audio masterclass, walking you through exactly how to find the ideal price for your services. Be sure to download my Pricing Formula for Service-Based Business, which I discuss in detail. If you still need help with your pricing after listening to this episode, let’s talk! Schedule a discovery call with me and let’s see where your roadblocks are. Key Points to Ponder  If your pricing isn’t where it should be, it will negatively impact many parts of your business. When you work for yourself, you don’t have to settle for a corporate annual salary. But you do need to be realistic. Just because you’ve been told you have to (or should) work 40 hours per week doesn’t make it true. Stop equating how hard you’re working and how many hours you’re working with how much you’re making. Your confidence in stating your rates needs to come from the fact that you’ve run the numbers; the numbers don’t come from thin air.

According to Charlene Li, what you do need is to acknowledge your customers are changing and you need to be thinking about your future. Charlene is the New York Times bestselling author of six books, including her newest release, The Disruption Mindset: Why Some Businesses Transform While Others Fail as well as co-author of the critically acclaimed book, Groundswell. She sits down with Kevin to talk about real disruption. It’s not about “blowing things up”, but about creating a real change. You need a passion to serve your future customer.

My guest today Matty Christopherson is proof that, even in an unconventional industry, you will see fruit when you put in the time and hard work to something you’re passionate about.\xa0 Matt Christopherson is the founder and President/CEO of Higharchy Brands Group, a company that helps cannabis brands maximize growth through advising and capital investment. Mr. Christopherson has over a decade of experience within the cannabis space, previously as VP of Business Development and a Partner at Keirton Inc., a company that provides growers with medical cannabis harvesting machines under the brand “Twister Trimmer”. In addition, Matt is a co-founder of Lift & Co, Canada’s largest cannabis education and tech platform powered by the industry’s largest database of medical marijuana and strain reviews left by real medical cannabis patients. He also sits on various boards within the cannabis industry. Matt is a director of a non-profit organization, Ruben’s Shoes. In this episode you will hear Matty’s experience working with a product that carried a big stigma 12 years ago, but has transitioned into one of the fastest growing sectors in the world.\xa0 “This industry has matured. There’s a lot of science behind the health benefits. People are now willing to share their experiences who were guarded and protected because of legality,” said Matty. Matty shares it was his entrepreneurial personality that brought him into the industry, and that he never was “pothead guy.” No matter your opinion on cannabis, The Green Rush is underway in the U.S., as more states legalize its usage. For Matty, that means greater market saturation and competition.\xa0 “We have to know our core focus and stay true to that. There’s a lot of shiny pennies out there, but you have to carve out a niche for sure,” he says. Subscribe and Review Have you subscribed to my podcast?

To get our business off the ground, we may have had to learn systems or processes on the fly because it was cheaper, easier and faster than hiring someone to do it for us! But after a while, we start to feel like the Doer in our own business and lose sight of what exactly we should be doing.\xa0 In this episode, you’ll hear the 5 reasons why even the most multi-talented entrepreneurs who can do it all shouldn’t do it all, and why we should delegate.\xa0 Ego, false humility, unworthiness, being the doer and not knowing what to do all keep us working in the business when we should be working on the business.\xa0 It boils down to this. If we spend so much of our time doing things we’re just competent at, it doesn’t leave much time for things we are EXCELLENT at. When we are dialed into the activities that ONLY WE can do, we are operating in our momentum zone, and driving the business forward.

This week, my part-time therapist, full-time comedic relief and all round lifesaver, Kim, joins me to give you a look behind the scenes of being an EA on a distributed team.\xa0 In this episode, you’ll hear what EAs need to be successful and how we work together to get stuff done without making each other crazy.\xa0 Kim shares her story of getting up to speed in the role, and handling the big learning curves.\xa0 She also shares what she needs to feel approval in her role, which in her case, are words of affirmation. The lesson here for executives is not to treat people the way we need to be treated, but to treat them the way they need to be treated.\xa0 Take the time to learn how your team receives affirmation. We also talk about how we resolve conflict, even as total personality opposites, and why it’s important as the leader to go to bat for your team. “There is security knowing you have my back,” says Kim.\xa0 We also discuss the importance of transparency and how as leaders, we can call potential out of our EAs they didn’t know they had, but they will also point out our blindspots!

Unfortunately, those two things are not the same.\xa0 Ownership is responsibility for the outcome. Leadership is responsibility to get there. Another key difference is vision. It is possible to own something and not have vision for it.\xa0 In this episode, you’ll hear how to navigate these two roles, and why serving as a trusted leader is imperative to our team and business’ success.\xa0 We created this phrase “Trusted Leader” because many business owners strive to build a team they can trust. For that to happen, we must be leaders worth trusting! A Trusted Leader leads with undeniable integrity. They are in the trenches with their team and with their clients.\xa0 Trusted Leaders cast vision and articulate it effectively. They delegate and empower their team to do more than they thought possible. To be a Trusted Leader, you allow your team to step IN so you can step OUT. This is how we get out of the weeds and get back to refining our systems, strategies and processes to scale. If you want support on this journey as a Trusted Leader, take our FREE Momentum Assessment.

A consultant at Insight, Philipsen speaks the language of traditional managers who expect a “playbook” for how to effectively manage in an Agile organization as well as the language of Agile.He and our host, Agile coach Chris Murman at Accenture | SolutionsIQ, vibe on the differences between managing styles as well as personal and interpersonal coaching techniques. Philipsen invokes the McCarthy protocol of requesting to provide feedback and radiating intention – for which he provides many examples.

He warns that if you do not have a good onboarding process, “within the first 45 days you could lose up to 20% of your new hires.” This has a large impact on building the persistent high-preforming teams needed to implement lasting change.Woods also believes that we can experience larger cultural change by starting with “small conscientious adjustments over time” and to be prepared for the long-haul: “like a lifestyle change, cultural changes often take 3-5 years within a company… we don’t want to get into the position where we think a few structural changes are going to make everything all better.”Accenture | SolutionsIQ’s Chris Murman hosts at Agile2019 in Washington, D.C.The Agile Amped podcast is the shared voice of the Agile community, driven by compelling stories, passionate people, and innovative ideas.

Mindfulness and meditation are in the mix because, as Bailey puts it, “For every minute you meditate, you get ten minutes back, because you notice that your mind has veered off track.”Favorite quotes:* “On average, we only work on one thing for 40 seconds before we switch to doing something else.”* “We can do almost anything for a minute besides focus… Your mind will resist even that one minute…”* “We’re the most creative when we have the least energy, because our minds are less inhibited.”Accenture | SolutionsIQ’s Leslie Morse hosts at Agile2019 in Washington, D.C.Find the book:https://alifeofproductivity.com/hyperfocus/The Agile Amped podcast is the shared voice of the Agile community, driven by compelling stories, passionate people, and innovative ideas.

Susan is a prolific author and sought-after speaker in the dental industry. She’s one of my top financial go-to persons so keep her information handy! A couple of high points from our conversation:  Hear what Susan and I both think about EFTs (electronic fund transfers). Her take on it comes from a Quickbooks and accounting point of view while I tackle the workload issues. Fraud in our industry is more widespread than you think. If you ask any speaker/consultant they’ll tell you reported numbers are low. Why is that? What do you do when you spot it? What does ethics have to do with dentistry? How often do Susan and Teresa hear crazy ethical questions? Often. We’ll describe different scenarios so you can be on the lookout. What’s this trend of zero-ing out fee schedules? We shake our head at this all too common phenomena. If you give employee benefits, are you reporting it correctly? Can it come back to bite you? We transition into one of Susan’s older books about caregiving. Whatever stage of life you’re in it’s applicable.

That said, the understanding of what a\xa0CISO\xa0does hasn\'t always followed the same trajectory. How do we as security professionals, help our organizations interact with our security teams and help them understand the role we play in an increasingly at risk world?\xa0\xa0   \xa0   The major difference between being a CISO for a vendor vs private organization\xa0   Working for a vendor, you have a direct line into change and solving the problems that really need to be solved.\xa0 \xa0Working with a private organization, it\'s everybody\'s opinion and no one knows really what you\'re talking about.\xa0 \xa0Lamont encourages everyone to spend time in both worlds because when you\'re working for a company, you\'re in a particular vertical so you have ground floor opportunity to understand all the challenges, whether they\'re business challenges, technology challenges, people challenges, you really get to understand the industry in which you\'re working and serving some of that.\xa0\xa0    \xa0   How did Lamont get his start?\xa0   He has had the opportunity of serving in a consulting capacity to organizations. That gave him more of that, that multi vertical multi industry perspective. Lamont wanted to give back and go to an organization where he got to grow something from the ground up, watch it grow and watch it be something really valuable and a differentiator to the business.\xa0 He also wanted to see\xa0what the opportunities were on the vendor side because it seemed very intriguing and an opportunity was presented. What he found is that the language barrier is gone. The challenge then became to take all of that industry expertise and all of that business knowledge and apply it to a way where he can lead the vendor side.\xa0\xa0When you\'re on the vendor and product side, you get to effect masses of companies.\xa0You get to interact with so many different thought leaders and coaches. You get to make the industry better from the solutions and tools perspective that we have to offer. But you\'re also growing people’s careers at the same time discussing the path that you\'ve gone through.\xa0\xa0Find opportunities to speak. There\'s just so much goodness in it that helps you grow as a professional also. There are so many lives that you can touch from a career perspective and making a difference and how we deal with our adversaries.\xa0\xa0    \xa0   Figuring out how to share in the security community\xa0   When you look at our adversaries, they\'re definitely sharing. They talk about the latest way they use and abuse. We need to do some of the same thing. “This is what was effective with this particular adversary.” “This was what was effective in this particular vertical because this is how we do business and this is what\'s effective”. Those types of conversations are priceless and we need to figure out a way to have more of them.\xa0\xa0\xa0   \xa0\xa0   What is change management?\xa0   There\'ll be changes in infrastructure. There\'ll be changes in operating model and there\'s a board that we have to go through to get the changes approved.\xa0 We implement those changes. If we start going back to fundamentals and what\'s happening in cybersecurity, what\'s happening with the role of the CISO and the CSO and all the technology players, we are back to the basic definition of change management. Not only do we have to adapt to change, we have to embrace it for what it brings.\xa0\xa0We have to look forward to what the positives are with this change. We have to demonstrate to others why this change was either good or is not the best plan of attack, and then we adjust. You don\'t want to have a stagnation in anything that you do because it either becomes boring or you become complacent. What this is showing us is that our industry is neither boring or complacent.\xa0 It is very dynamic and we need to figure out how to manage that.\xa0   \xa0   What\xa0change\xa0are you excited about?\xa0   Lamont is\xa0excited about the movement to cloud.\xa0 \xa0The industry as a whole, it\'s a new operating model. We\'ve so long looked at all of these different solutions that we\'ve cobbled together to keep filling gaps of whatever the threat landscape brought to us with this movement. Now we get to take a fresh look and if we are at a point where we have a seat at the table, we get to walk with the business and actually consult with them and talk to them about what this new paradigm that they want to go into will really bring.\xa0 With our fresh look, we can say that we\'re really looking to enable you to be able to take away some of this friction cause we don\'t have all of these different hoops and a different control frameworks and the whole let\'s lock it down mentality anymore. We know that you need to be open and now we need solutions. We need to look for those solutions that will allow the openness.\xa0\xa0    \xa0   What\xa0advice would you have for a new CISO?\xa0   you got to build relationships.\xa0\xa0Just keep it simple. Security needs to be a friend of the business. It needs to be a partner to the business. We need to build those relationships in order to show how we cannot be a pimple in the path to progress, but be that progress, be that innovator and progress.\xa0\xa0    \xa0   Is there a\xa0difference\xa0between authority and influence as it relates to the movement of the cloud?\xa0   The dynamic is definitely changing to influence. Influence is much stronger than authority. When you breed influence through an organization, you\'re creating the emissaries of the division and you\'re getting consensus around that. Once you get the spirit of how you want to move forward and making sure all decisions map to that, you won\'t have to use your authority.\xa0\xa0    \xa0   How are challenges different for large vs small organizations in moving to the Cloud?\xa0   The challenges are different.\xa0 The larger the organization, the more politics, the more structure around, we\'ve always done it this way. There\'s more teachable moments that have to be identified and teach that organization, team, individual, why you\'re looking at it from this particular perspective. In smaller companies, there\'s less politics. There are more consolidated functions and one or two individuals which makes it easier to influence across those teams. The smaller companies are more nimble too.\xa0\xa0\xa0    \xa0\xa0   What is the change that is happening to security leaders?\xa0   Over the course of the profession, the security leaders, we\'ve all tried to center this activity of security and really believe that we can manage it from a central perspective. In many cases before this disruption really started to occur with the disruption of cloud, there was all these different types of disruption. We are now trying to decentralize and bill those influences and emissaries and the different groups within dev ops.\xa0    \xa0   What is the\xa0definition of the new CISO?\xa0   The modern CISO is really going to look to embrace change management and actually have a roadmap to how they are going to embrace this change. Whether that\'s moving to the cloud, whether that\'s moving to hybrid infrastructures and looking at this in a way where it\'s as a positive restart for our profession and a restart for all the complexity of controls and processes and policies that we\'ve put in place to make it something less friction to the business and realizing that we\'re in the business of managing risks and realizing that control frameworks are just that.\xa0 They\'re a framework. In many of these new paradigms and structures, the control frameworks when applicable may actually cost the business something in productivity.\xa0\xa0Page Break\xa0   \xa0 Resources:\xa0   Exabeam\xa0–\xa0Website\xa0   Steve Moore –\xa0LinkedIn\xa0   Lamont Orange –\xa0LinkedIn\xa0   Netskope\xa0–\xa0Website\xa0  | Understanding the Adversary Mick Jenkins, Chief Information Security Officer at Brunel University & a former Counter Terrorism officer in the British Armed Forces speaks with Steve Moore about the ideological similarities between defending against terrorists versus cyber criminals, the benefits of mentorship throughout your career in security, and the re-emergence of Soviet era espionage techniques. Building a career in security can be a challenge, even for those of us who start off early. For some however, the job can be a natural progression from her Majesty\'s armed forces to helping secure the 2012 Olympics and ultimately becoming a CISO. So how do you channel these unique experiences into something that will withstand the diverse threats organizations face today? \xa0 Who is Mick Jenkins? My career & professional involvements these days are in cybersecurity and sort of lie in the world I exist in as a non-executive director. At the moment I do all sorts of different things on the computer in terms of dealing with investigations, dealing with IT directors, and current strategies. I signed up & started working in her majesty\'s armed forces when I was sixteen and a half years old. I certainly never expected to end up as a CISO dealing with strategic cyber security because my life began as a soldier in the British Army. \xa0 Working with a Mentor During the Transformation Process I think you and I are both very keen on spotting & identifying the leaders of tomorrow and investing in them. And I think this is particularly important because as we know, over the next 5-10 years, the cyber world is going to need the best of leaders to support boards and deliver strategies that are coherent.\xa0 For me having had such wonderful careers, I want to be able to pay some of that back to younger men & ladies. These are people who have the talent to go all the way to the top of the cyber tree as CISOs or strategic leaders both in government and the private sector. Luckily I\'m connected with a number of people and different organizations here in the UK, and one of the wonderful ones is a small company taking veterans, who have done something like 22 years or more in service in the military. These are very loyal servants, very disciplined, very capable, and quick learners. The organization takes them out of the forces and retrains them as cyber specialists, cyber analysts, or information security managers, and then places them in industries. It has been very important and key for me that I try to help people who\'ve got the talent. And just like in the military, it\'s all about thought and actual leadership. It’s about leading by example, having good strategic foresights and acting as a mentor or coach. At the moment I have 2 individuals who are much younger than me who I believe have got the talent. I’m earmarking them for the right career progression over the course of 5-10 years and trying to make sure that they do progress all the way to the top of the cyber tree. I was lucky as my mentor used to take me for lunch quite often every 2-3 months. And he would ask, ‘Are you in the right job here?’, ‘Is there anything I can do?’, ‘Tell me about this company you\'re working for’, ‘I really think you need to be doing this and this next.’ I had that for the 15 years I had in both the military and in my ultimate career in cyber security. And so I think mentorship and identifying good talent is something we owe ourselves for the future, which is something I particularly enjoy doing. \xa0 Mick’s Advice for the Transformation Process As I look back at my career, one thing about me is that I was always striving to achieve excellence and be honest in whatever I was asked to do or serve in her Majesty\'s service. And I think many of us in the professional armed forces do strive for sheer excellence. And if you\'ve got that kind of psyche to achieve excellence, you\'ll go above & beyond to learn from people. In my case a lot of it was about learning about the adversary. When I started working as an explosive disposal officer, particularly involved in high risk research, I wanted to beat the terrorist and so I needed to be at the top of my game. I took every opportunity to talk to some of the more experienced ground operators who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. I looked up to my mentor as well. It\'s always a fabulous thing for someone going through multiple careers to have a mentor or coach. My particular mentor is a wonderful chap called John Almonds. He is in his seventies now, and he is the guy I aspire to be. I hope to achieve everything he did throughout his military & civilian careers. He is still a very fit man - fitness in body & mind, which kind of exists all the way through your military career into retirement. And this certainly helps when dealing with high stress/ high pressure situations. \xa0 Understanding Your Adversary In the army, I finished as an Intelligence Officer within the British Defense Intelligence. And then I made the transformation into civilian streets where I was working on information security, initially working with ultra-high security data centers. Then I made a transition through Olympics where I was the Lead Security Practitioner/Strategic for London 2012. After that I moved to the University world. Throughout all this transformation I moved from the adversary in the counter-terrorism world to the adversary in the cyber space world. Doctrinally there\'s no difference; we have an enemy, we have an adversary and they use a variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures that you as the defender need to know. You need to know how they will damage your organization or critical infrastructure. I had to learn about the technical elements of how the attacker exploited vulnerabilities, how they got their target asset, or how they used a particular technology to be able to attack. So for me it was all about excellence and trying to know/understand the adversary because if you know him and can predict the threats arising over the next couple of years, you can begin to build your own defense mechanism to protect your organization. \xa0 The Kompromat Kill This is my second book. I chose the title about 18 months ago and then from the title I wrote the story. What I think you or the American community will find interesting is the word “Kompromat”. Since 2016, all of a sudden it’s been immersed into American folklore. And of course it\'s a Russian term. For a very long time the\xa0 Russians have used the tactic of using compromising material against ministers, soldiers, and anybody in the community that they could use to their advantage. Effectively what they use is blackmail material and they have been the masters of this for decades. Now we see the terminology coming through because of the linkages and allegations put across into the current US administration. In addition, we now see this term being used quite radically in American media. But it’s less so over here in Britain. The novel gives a little bit of insight to readers about how this tactic is applied in the intelligence community, in the world of high breed warfare, and dodgy dossiers that we\'ve seen on both sides of the Atlantic. I wanted to immerse the reader to see what is effectively a spy thriller linking the geo-political situation with ground operators doing the work of collecting intelligence. There are also elements of cyber technology & attacks in the novel. \xa0 How to Combat Shady Online Information I think this is about continual improvement, and one of the elements of this is your organizations\' ability to react to different levels of incidents. Here in the UK, The National Cyber Security Centre does a great job in providing out of the box exercises. They go out of their way to try & assist because quite often in companies there isn\'t that experience, and many times you have to buy the expertise to conduct screening and policing.\xa0 I also think that there is a big shift here in the UK to actually make sure that the board understands the risks they face and some of the serious consequences that their business or physical infrastructure could face. And for organizations that actually do the exercises, each person can witness or be exposed to the roles and responsibilities of others and what they will actually be doing during a major incident. This ranges from the legal team, board level individuals all the way through disaster recovery people, IT, physical security & policing. All these entities need to come together regularly to exercise and understand who will be doing what. Another important thing is that it\'s very important to coach the executive board on what their roles and responsibilities are during a major incident. This includes a terrorist incident or cyber-attack, and is part of consequence management. This is why a CISO has to have a good relationship with all members of the executive board. \xa0 Resources: Exabeam - Website Exabeam Spotlight Conference - Website Steve Moore - LinkedIn Michael Jenkins\xa0 - Website The National Cyber Security Centre - Website | Contributing to the Cybersecurity Community Scott Morris, Vice President, Chief Information Security Officer at BlueCross BlueShield Western New York sits down to talk to Steve Moore about how to be active on cybersecurity communities. They\xa0 talk about how to encourage young security professionals to find their voice, and the importance of sharing information as a means of strengthening the industry as a whole. \xa0 What Advice Would You Have for Your Younger Self? I\'m not one to really hold regrets or look back at the past, but I would say I\'ve always pursued the uncomfortable things. I always try to find things to solve or problems I could help with, which is how I got around in the day. So always challenge yourself and make sure that you always make the right choices. I would tell my younger self to continue pushing. \xa0 What Was Your Actual Start in InfoSec? My starting point was in information technology, more importantly in web development. I used to be a web developer by trade & quickly came to understand the risks involved in that. I continued to grow in my information security knowledge & experience, and for a while I was an expert in my former organization. And then I grew from there with a keen desire to know as much as I can and to help as much as I can in information security. Through observation & conversation, Steve Moore has come to realize that some of the best people in InfoSec didn\'t actually start off in it. You kind of have to learn to build and create things and ultimately break them before you can know how to defend and protect them. And this is a great foundation As I look back on my career, I recently realized that even from the early days and in previous organizations, I\'ve never actually applied for a position; I\'ve always somewhat in a way created the position. And I did that by finding areas or things that needed to be solved or fixed and made better. In my current organization for example, we had an issue where we were having problems passing or being consistently good in our external audits. I took that on and turned it around, and through that exposure in a very diverse organization, I was able to start piecing together some of the things we needed to get where we are today and build the successful security program we have in place. \xa0 Any Tips for Someone Getting Ready to Do What You\'ve Done? The answer is something I tell all of my team members today. For the most part, what we do is not something we\'re responsible for and we can successfully build respect and great relationships. You need to understand your controllers and the people responsible for these processes and functions and build a relationship with them to help move things forward. \xa0 How Did You Get Involved in Security Communities? At my previous role, I worked for a large consulting company and I had a very large community. But I realized that I needed to have more exposure outside of that. So I started turning to people and organizations locally around here. But there weren’t security communities back then; there were more technology communities. So getting involved with technology organizations was my entry point. I was hooked immediately and continued to grow & expand to where I am today. \xa0 What Do You Think is the Responsibility of Security Leaders? As a leader, I think it\'s really important to set an example. I try to do the best I can by participating in these communities in various ways by not only attending it but by being a part of it, being an action and a voice within these communities, and by bringing my teams along and the people that are in this space. As leaders we have a responsibility to continue driving that. In Buffalo we are a pretty small community and we leverage those conduits and forms to continue to grow and vet out what we\'re doing. So lead by example, participate and the teams will come along. \xa0 What Benefits/Changes Have You Seen in the Junior Staff in the Buffalo Area? In Blue Cross Blue Shield, we are fortunate to have a robust and talented security department, and not a lot of people especially in Buffalo or other small organizations have that. So we push out there and continue with what we\'re doing. And this helps a lot of people get past those first few layers with decisions and choices if they can hear from a trusted source. And frankly those conversations help us as well as we continue to share our experiences with the community not only in Buffalo but across the nation. We try to present topics that we feel others can learn from and we get great feedback by sharing the experiences we\'ve had, and especially the lessons learned. \xa0 What Do You Share? Two of our primary outlets for that is first ,within the Blue Cross Blue Shield community where we have more than 30 organizations, and we tend to share things within that trusted community quite often. We\'re also a huge proponent and a member of Hysek, and that\'s been a tremendous value for information sharing across healthcare organizations and other places as well. In my team, we encourage participation and often times the exact conversation we’ve had is centered around ‘what value can I add?’, ‘why would someone listen to me?’ And through that we hope people can realize how important their message is because there\'s always an audience for that. So for a young leader, professional, or analyst trying to get involved, I would advise him to not undermine or underestimate himself and the power of his voice and message. And instead get involved with the people of that community. Organizations and groups are always looking for topics and people want to listen and are genuine about it. And they\'ll give you the feedback you need to help you grow. Getting comfortable presenting in front of an audience is important for a leader, so for anyone listening that should be your goal. It makes you a better leader in the long run. It takes practice and one resource people should take advantage of is Toastmasters. It\'s a wonderful opportunity and gives you an established and well trusted forum to horn your skills at public speaking. Most of my team members go through it. \xa0 What Did You Learn at Toastmasters that Helped You the Most? The first time I did Toastmasters, I got really confident about what I was talking about. They give you very candid feedback at the end, and I think I broke a record for how many \'umhs\' I said, although I thought I said 3 or 4. But it was eye opening and gave me something to move forward with. The best feedback I got from them that helped me grow was to just own what you are saying, knowing that you know the most about what you\'re talking about. And be confident at what you\'re doing. That\'s going to make a world of difference from how your presentation comes off. \xa0 What has Changed in Security Communities Over the Years? Back when I started, there was little to know on cybersecurity community. But now you can\'t move around the corner without finding some kind of group that\'s wanting to talk about it. I recently had a conversation with a number of CISOs last week, and we\'re finding that these communities or groups are actually struggling because everyone is so busy trying to protect their organizations and move forward. So I\'m starting to see a little bit of downward trend in these things. People don\'t seem to have the bandwidth to keep these things going. And so we need more people who are passionate about keeping the organizations going, keeping the topic going, and moving those things forward to make sure we continue to have this amazing opportunity to participate and share information. \xa0 What’s the One Thing You Could Eliminate from Security Communities? I won\'t say there\'s one overarching thing I would want to remove because the communities don’t have the same problems. But I think we need to make sure that the level of entitlement is kind of tapered, because some of these communities get far ahead of themselves or become too exclusive. And these can start to create negative connotations to what we\'re trying to do. So keeping it open, ethical, and moving everything forward in the best interests of the people who are part of these communities is the important thing to keeping mind. In every community, take the best you can from it and continue to build on that and everything will come around. \xa0 How Do You Choose Which Security Community to Be Involved In? I think it\'s about setting the proper expectations for yourself and in some cases the people in that community. Also make sure the community is not there just for the party or the vendor sponsor, but to learn. Once you attend one, I think you can pretty well determine if it\'s just a party so to speak, or if it\'s really there for an opportunity. It\'s all about what you make out of it. As a leader at some point you have to give up those spots & invite someone else, and as you grow you\'ll get more invites and be more well-known and influential. In every community, take the best you can from it and continue to build on that and everything will come around. In my case I\'m lucky because I have a great team that wants to be involved and it’s not me pulling them along. They\'re very eager & outgoing in that nature of getting involved and we all share that mission together. \xa0 Is There a Measured Outcome? One of our metrics is our participation in events in the community across the department. We track how often we do that and report to our board of directors. We have a very supportive leadership helping the community in any capacity, whether in cybersecurity or someone who could be affected by it. We also use the information, the conversations and networks that we build to help enhance our cyber strategy as we go forward. We use our cyber experience to help the broader community - employees, our members, providers, and brokers. We do what we can to get out and socialize and help them understand and benefit from the information we have to help protect themselves. This is something our organization feels strongly about.\xa0 \xa0 Resources: Exabeam - Website Steve Moore - LinkedIn Scott Morris\xa0 - LinkedIn BlueCross BlueShield - Website | Does Security Training Really Work? David Tyburski, Chief Information Security Officer at Wynn Resort sits down to talk to Steve Moore about security training, specifically phishing training. He shares his thoughts on the idea of training vs education, positive vs negative reinforcement, and offers suggestions for engaging with employees. \xa0 David Tyburski’s Current Role I\'m currently the global CISO for Wynn Resort, a casino in the north end strip in Las Vegas. About 9 years ago, Wynn put a directive to have a more dedicated security focus in on the environment in the organization. They basically handed it to me and for the last nine and a half years I have run this organization building it from just me to the organization it is today, managing all their properties & operations worldwide. \xa0 What Advice Would You Give Your Younger Self? One thing I would say is to be a little more attentive to the tool-set you bring, because we did a lot of false starts along the way as far as buying tools. If we\'d spent a little more time evaluating where we could really use them, we would have been in a better position in the early days. And we do that today by ensuring we have good proper use of cases for every tool that we bring. Also, I\'d tell my younger self to spend more time on the use case to know how to use it instead of just going to get it. Understand not just the reason why you want it, but how you will use it and what you expect from it. \xa0 What Bothers You About Phishing Training? It\'s not necessarily all phishing training, but what bothers me is that we\'re attempting to teach non-security professionals to be security professionals. They have backgrounds that are varied from us, they don\'t spend their time looking at security incidences or reading on security articles, but they\'re extremely talented people in other ways. They do an amazing job at what they do. But we as security professionals try to teach them that they\'ve got to know what we know. So I think security professionals need to do a better job of understanding their role in the business, and building a technology solution around that instead of trying to get them to understand their business. Training vs Education There\'s a major difference between training & education. Wynn is an education program, because we\'re not training people but educating them. We want to give them the security knowledge and information they need for their organizations. We\'re educating people, trying to give them knowledge and not just teaching them the steps to accomplish something. We have to be able to transfer knowledge, and that\'s an education program. We have a continuous education program. We break up the topics and put them into small easy to digest chunks and we continuously run a new topic every week. It\'s timely and we do everything we can to relate it to everyday life. People are like water and will always try to take the path of least resistance. So in that light, if we can make our security program and educate our people in the right way, that the security of the organization is the path of least resistance, then it\'s no longer security fighting the rest of the business but security enabling the entire business to operate. \xa0 Should Information Security Be More Aggressive with Email Attachments? For an HR person whose job is recruiting, he needs to open the resumes he receives as attachments to emails. So how does information security help or enable that process and allow the person do the job safely? One way we can do this is to intercept the email, pull the attachment out, and re-write it in our own PDF where we turn off all the problematic ability and take out any possibility of weaponization, restrict what that PDF can do and look like, bundle it up and put it back in the email and send it off to the recipient. Now we won’t mind if the HR person opens it because it\'s safe.\xa0 So to them they simply open the resumes the way they need to open them. They\'re doing their job and we\'re enabling it, but we\'re also protecting them from all the weaponization problems that could come along with emails and attachments. \xa0 Good Security Programs If you bring in negative reinforcement in your organization, it will only go so far. If your objective is to reduce malware in your environment or reduce that phishing problem, then training people the way we seem to want to do is a negative reinforcement model. You may end up frightening employees to the extent that they\'re not willing to take the risk. So it\'s important to find a better way to bring that into your organization so that employees do their job of generating revenue and doing good things for the business. Employees also need to have a way to communicate back both positive & negative feedback- did it work or not, what slipped through and what did we not recognize? Any good security program is not dependent on one single item. You need to have multiple places to protect the same thing. So if we\'re eliminating 99.99% of phishing & malware coming through email by rewriting attachments, then what slipped through & why? What was that new technique the hacker used, what is that new thing that we haven\'t accounted for? That\'s what we need to focus on. One of the things we push out for in our education program is the open door policy. A lot of companies have it but how many line level employees are comfortable picking up the phone & talking to the CFO? Probably not a lot. But in this organization we have made that an absolutely acceptable act and the CFO is responsive to it and is on board. Therefore, you involve everyone so that the entire organization is working towards that same goal. Security becomes a lot easier because you have allies helping you do it as opposed to shadow security. \xa0 What Other Things Can We Do? One other thing I do a lot is what I call evangelist activities. I go sit with the business and not just the managers or directors of the business, but actually line level employees. I have conversations with them, eat lunch with them, talk to them in their own environments, sit with the project team, the gaming people, their sales people, sit and learn their jobs for a day and get a better understanding of their work. I do these things regularly so that they can build trust in the program and in me to have an open line of communication. How can we help them do their job better? We want to be able to bring them into our world and enhance collaboration. Also, if you look at a lot of the primary activities of any user in any organization, two of the biggest things that the end user is going to deal with are:  email attachments browsing the web  So I would advise security professionals to investigate browsing installation platforms. Understand that it\'s not just about rewriting docs and emails and things that are inbound to the organization but also the outbound activities of the user like exploring the web. Do You Think Information Security as a Whole Has a Problem I think every organization is different, every CISO is different and company cultures are different. I think information security has to adapt to that within their organization and promote the change that\'s necessary. We do get a bad rap in some cases because sometimes we have to say ‘No’, but I think some organizations take that to the extreme. Therefore, it\'s all about building a culture for your organization. What works for Wynn may not work in another organization. But if you understand the business & the people, and your objective is to enable the business’ safety and working towards those goals, I don\'t see how you could go wrong. The idea that you only tell someone what they can\'t do and never tell them what they can do is a wrong position. \xa0 Resources: Exabeam - Website SentinelOne - Website Steve Moore - LinkedIn David Tyburski\xa0 - LinkedIn Wynn Resort - Website | Building an Effective Relationship with a Board Colin Anderson, Chief Information Security Officer at Levi Strauss & Co sits down with Steve Moore to talk about interacting and building an effective relationship with an organization’s board, managing expectations and sharing narratives that resonate, the makeup of a board meeting, and the different personalities associated with it.\xa0 \xa0 What the CISO & a Board Have in Common The CISO and the board share something in common, which is to manage risk and make the business successful. However, the CISO has to earn the board\'s trust even when it\'s well established that he is the security subject matter expert.\xa0 \xa0 Successful relationships must be nurtured, and this one is no different. Each board member comes to the table with a different point of view, background, expectations, and personality. Getting to know the board and how to best communicate with them is one of the CISO\'s top priorities. \xa0 Advice to a Younger Self The first rule is to know your board, because every board is different. Some are savvy & cyber aware while others have little technology & security exposure. You need to do your homework to better understand your board members\' areas of expertise and experience. You want to know if any of them have had a security incidence or breach in the past, and if they have a deep understanding of security. \xa0 Another important question to ask yourself is whether you know any security leaders that have worked with some of your board members.\xa0 \xa0 It\'s also important to know your narrative; what\'s the plan for your security function, how do you measure progress, and how best do you communicate and earn the trust and support from that board? I\'ve seen a lot of leaders present in front of board committees and the most common mistake I see is the presenter not being prepared for that board audience. The presenter knows his stuff but he fails in communicating it in a way that earns the board\'s trust & confidence.\xa0 \xa0 That story-telling skill is very important because your board is going to remember the narrative you tell them. They may resonate with the statistics you put in front of them temporarily, but a few months down the road they\'re not going to remember the numbers. They will remember the narrative you gave, that example you crafted to emphasize the point you wanted to put across. \xa0 The Different Types of Boards There are different types of boards, where some are security savvy while others are not. Generally, they don\'t care, they have an IT background, or they don\'t. But a day of reckoning is here for them. They need to figure out and no longer be ignorant to these issues or be dismissive of them. They should know what the security department, and especially what the CISO, does.\xa0 \xa0 However, the security topic with boards is relatively new and still in its infancy. They don\'t really know how to measure whether that security program or security leader is being effective. The NACD (National Association of Corporate Directors) has put out some pretty prescriptive guidance for boards on how to effectively manage security risk. This helps educate the board and also helps the security leader know how the board will be measuring them. \xa0 Presenting to a Board Earning your board\'s trust is the most important thing you can do for your long-term success as a CISO. Educate them & build that partnership where you both work to manage risk to the business and enable it succeed.\xa0 \xa0 The other board members bring skills and experience you don\'t possess, and you have skills and information they likely do not possess. They\'re looking at you as a subject matter expert on security to help them make more informed business decisions. So if a situation is bad & there\'s a problem, don\'t be afraid to put that concerning information to your board. Don\'t be afraid to say that you don\'t have all the answers. Tell them what you\'re doing or what you’re not going to do & why. In reality you have to make some hard choices. And that transparency gives credibility to your message and plans. \xa0 The board is relying on you based on what you think is critical or important because they may not have all the background information. Your assessment of the situation carries a lot more weight with the board. \xa0 Bringing in a 3rd Party to a Board Meeting A 3rd party can be brought in to emphasize a specific plan or concern you have. That extra voice can carry a lot of weight in some boards. The board may also bring in a 3rd party like an audit person to ask questions or give more insight on a given topic. \xa0 If another CISO is to be brought in, he needs to bring more than just the security skillset to a board to be an effective board member. \xa0 The Toughest Board Member Ever Presented to There was a telecommunications executive who had previously experienced a major security breach. He was new to the specific retail company in question and so he didn\'t have a really big understanding of the business. Also, he didn\'t fully understand that the business risk and often adversaries were quite different between retail and telecommunication companies.\xa0 \xa0 He was incredibly concerned that something similar could happen at the new organization he was joining as a board member. This challenge was not solved in one meeting. It took Anderson 3-6 months of talking to this individual member. He worked on educating him on the new business, what was different and what was similar. The board member came in very concerned because of the event he had experienced. So he was not very trusting. \xa0 Getting the executive on board involved conversations in and out of the boardroom. Sometimes it was one-on-one and at other times the general counsel was present. Anderson educated him about the business, how he viewed risk and the risks he was most concerned about, and what they were doing to manage those risks. The executive brought up questions about what happened at the previous telecommunications company & Anderson would share his perspectives on how he would handle a similar situation. Over time trust was built & he appreciated that Anderson understood where he came from. \xa0 Building Effective Relationships\xa0 To build an effective relationship, you want to learn about the business at hand & how you can help them. What are they doing & how can you help? Focus on how you can be more effective for them. Security is often a support function & the business leaders are the ones generating business revenue for the organization. And as a CISO you are there to help them succeed. If you can build that beneficial relationship, then it\'s a win-win. \xa0 Sometimes in a board meeting you may be asked questions that are not in your specific area of expertise. It may be advisable to avoid such questions. There are also some metrics you would avoid with the board. Anderson likes to present metrics that tell a story or trend, metrics that can be used to make important decisions. This is because they are relevant & more aligned to the business & the board will care about them. Use metrics to emphasize specific decisions you\'re making. \xa0 One good piece of advice is to try to think & plan through the questions you\'re likely to get from the board based on the content you\'re presenting. This will lead to more success with the board. \xa0 Also, if you’re short of time to make a presentation, it\'s good to send your content about 1 week in advance. This way you go in with the expectation that they\'ve read it & you can focus on a few things on the presentation. But if you\'re really cut to very few minutes, just hit the most important points and adjust your presentation accordingly.\xa0 \xa0 Anderson’s Take on Working in Levi Strauss & Co Levi Strauss & Co is an amazing company that attracts people that believe in a mission. The company believes in doing right. It supports the community and embraces diversity & inclusion. It believes in giving back & on philanthropy. It\'s a wonderful place to work. \xa0 Resources: Exabeam - Website Steve Moore - LinkedIn Colin Anderson - LinkedIn NACD - Website | What it Means to be an Honest Broker As a former CISO in Hanover Insurance Group, Brian Haugli shares what it means to be an honest broker in the context of security leadership, which might be better described as an agent of trust and transparency for a business. \xa0Brian and Steve Moore talk about strategies for delivering the right message to executives and the Board, the learning opportunities that come with candor and the honest truth about managing the inherent stress of the position. Advice to future or current leaders One big feedback I would give my younger self is don\'t focus so much on one area or another. Really be open to the ancillary spaces within security. Looking at human behavior, looking at the legal side of things, and pulling that information in to help round you out. Is there a core of bad leadership in information security? Not everyone is born to be a leader. It\'s something that you\'re born with that type of a capability. I think you look back at like type A/type B personalities. A lot of security folks are the type B, and there\'s nothing wrong with that, but I think there\'s a different level of getting leadership out of that that isn\'t as natural for them as somebody who is a type A, an outgoing type of a person. I don\'t think there\'s bad leaders in InfoSec. I just don\'t think there\'s enough of them. Transitioning on a small team vs large team On a smaller organization, you\'re going to wear more hats because there\'s just not enough people for that work to go around. The larger organizations, what I learned was I could sit down a team or four or five analysts, teach them in one or two hours how I would do something. And now, I\'ve multiplied my capabilities by five. And that\'s much more effective than me trying to do that individually. The smaller teams, smaller orgs, they are struggling with being able to address this and I think that\'s where I want to find a niche for developing some work and some support and driving insight and guidance to these groups because they need help. The start of Side Channel Security We saw the need that small and medium businesses, nonprofits, VC-backed software firms, don\'t need a CISO full time but still need that kind of guidance and expertise. We started by supporting a nonprofit ... realizing the questions and the concerns were the same things that we had heard from our peers in larger organizations or our own organizations at the time. \xa0It just built upon itself. Where are people most ignorant as it relates to information security and running a good program? I\'ve got a bit of a mantra that I can\'t defend what I don\'t know exists and that\'s really asset identification, asset allocation. \xa0Being able to answer what is your business obligations? And what are your business objectives? Can you identify the things that keep you running and could you tell me what a bad day looks like? You have to make them understand that your new reliance on technology and you storing all of this data and/or allowing access to these systems equates to your ability to provide services to your customers, whatever that is then. Those are usually ah-ha moments for folks and it\'s a good one to be there for because you can quickly help them realize what their concerns really should be from a security standpoint, but then quickly get them to how do we tackle this? How do we make this not an issue any longer? How do we mitigate that risk? What is an honest broker when delivering a security message to the ELT or the Board? I think it\'s just about transparency and integrity. Security, the definition of security, is confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As the CISO, your ability to obviously protect those things is one aspect. Your ability to showcase and embody the integrity of what it is that is being expected of you. Turning that around and then being able to explain that in terms that honestly chances are nontechnical person and somebody who definitely doesn\'t understand information security is going to understand. Do they always really want the truth? Everybody always wants the truth but what they want is to make sure that you\'re not positioning as if the sky is falling on every conversation you\'re having. It\'s about talking about the level of risk at an appropriate level. What most senior leaders really want to hear is that you\'ve got it under control. \xa0What you can do is be completely honest in the fact that you don\'t know what you don\'t know and then promise that you\'re going to go figure it out and come back to them with something. What are things that we forget to do? I think the thing that gets missed a lot is that security doesn\'t exist without the business. We\'re not in the position for the sake of a company or an organization. What’s the worst archetype of a CISO? I think there\'s a major difference between the CISO who has a real technical understanding of everybody on his team or her team and those who came through the CIO track or the business track. I think you can just be much more effective as a leader if you understand all the roles that your team members are capable of and doing. And I think that\'s one thing I\'ve differentiated myself on is I\'ve done just about anything that anybody on my team is I\'m charging to do. Is CISO a good job? I feel like some days it can be but I keep volunteering and keep pursuing them so there\'s got to be either there\'s something wrong with me in that respect or it\'s not actually as bad as we think about it. Is there any time where you go and you present this messaging and leaders of membership don\'t want to hear it? Hearing about a risk is difficult for people to comprehend and maybe even be able to accept. Take the approach of positioning the best idea that you pay me to bring you. \xa0There\'s really no reason to get into an argument or really try to hammer on something that a business owner doesn\'t want to tackle. Any lessons or any observations in terms of doing more with less? Biggest thing I learned out of the military was the concept of BLUF, bottom line up front. So, just position the idea that is the most impactful, the key term or concept that you want that person or that group to walk away from, just put it right up front. Get there, put it out there, speak to it, and then, build, if you have the time obviously in the presentation slides or whatever material to be to actually do it. Build out from there. But drive at least the one thing that you want them to know right up front. Resources: Exabeam - Website Side Channel Security - Website Steve Moore - LinkedIn Brian Haugli - LinkedIn | The Ins and Outs of Budgeting Andrew Wild, CISO at QTS Data Centers, sits down with Steve Moore to talk about IT security budgets, the challenges of prioritizing resources to balance risk and the value of cooperation. \xa0 IT Security Budget Managing an IT security budget isn\'t just about spreadsheets and internal procurement processes, it\'s about understanding your organization\'s business priorities. Add to that, the management of your vendors and VARs with which you work. A CISO\'s focus is to protect the organization and measurably reduce risk, which often requires the acquisition of technology. However, those decisions aren\'t just about tech. There\'s a lot of management planning that must occur. The combination of transparency, forecasting and relationship building is good for business. \xa0 Challenges of Prioritizing Resources to Balance Risk Anyone that aspires to have a more senior leadership role in an organization, needs to understand how things are budgeted and financed and paid for. Look at the amount that was budgeted in previous years and what was actually spent. Sometimes that is a way to glean some insight into how well that role is functioning. In some cases, an organization may be growing so fast that you or your budget is continually being adjusted upward which can be a great thing. An indicator perhaps of some issues either in execution or enough resources to execute would be if the amount that was budgeted exceeds by a not insignificant amount the amount that was spent. \xa0If you\'re not spending everything that you were allocated, that\'s an indication of a problem within the organization. \xa0 The Value of Cooperation In the information security arena, there is very little that the information security team itself is able to accomplish without support across the organization. The infosec team is leading part of the effort, but there\'s always another team that\'s needed, whether it\'s the team that\'s racking the hardware. Whether it\'s the team that\'s going through and supporting you in the procurement process. Whether it\'s the legal team in terms of contract reviews. You are, to a very large extent, dependent upon other organizations to be able to accomplish your mission. It\'s important to try to learn how the procurement process works. What is the mechanism through which the value added resellers, the VARs, are selected, do you have the ability to influence which VARs you will get to work with for your information security solutions and services. It\'s not always just about within your organization too. It\'s about how you work with both the vendors and the VARs. Be considerate of the fact that the vendors and VARs work on a forecasting model where they have to be able to, with some level of precision, predict when opportunities are gonna close. Be up front and be transparent. \xa0 What is Being Forecasted? In any kind of a sales organization, the organization expects to be able to know what kind of transactions are gonna happen, what opportunities have been identified and that there is a definite progression through the sales process or the funnel as some people call it, where an opportunity for sales is identified--there\'s a need, there\'s a solution developed. People depend upon being able to plan because that\'s how companies be able to better plan and meet their numbers particularly if it is a publicly traded company. \xa0 What Makes a Good VAR? Someone that has likely either deployed the technology in their own environment or has deployed it in other customer environments and knows the solution it sells, and they\'re almost an extension of the company\'s sales engineering team. VARs will provide some very valuable information that you might not get working directly with the company itself. \xa0 A Better Relationship with Sales Go talk to people outside your organization. It can be very inspiring and helpful. It can also potentially lead to new opportunities. If you don\'t interact with people, it\'s really hard to be able to plan out your career. Either to know what you\'re interested in, or to become aware potentially of opportunities. It’s really about engaging with the larger part of the organization, recognizing that at some level, every member of the organization is a representative of that company, and is in some way assisting the organization in achieving its goals. Whether it be directly, through supporting the sales process, or cost management, or getting a project done on time or early. \xa0 Growth of the CISO Position It\'s certainly getting bigger from a risk perspective. \xa0It\'s becoming a larger position because it\'s less focused on just implementing technology and more focused on managing business relationships and identifying and guiding an organization through the navigation of risk management. \xa0 Resources: Exabeam - Website QTS Data Centers - Website Steve Moore - LinkedIn Andrew Wild - LinkedIn | Lessons Learned from a Virtual CISO Matt Klein, Virtual CISO and Executive Advisor at Optiv, sits down with Steve Moore to share his insights on teamwork, getting visibility at the executive level, and the right prep for effective board conversations. \xa0 What is a Virtual CISO? Think of it as a trusted advisor, an executive advisor, talking about strategic elements of your security program, even some technical elements, at a high to medium level. \xa0They are a trusted person to work with a company and make sure that they\'re headed in the right direction. Also, they are that person to bounce concepts off of and to make sure they\'re doing the right things as they\'re building their information security program. \xa0There are times where the virtual CISO model comes into play where either the CISO has left the company, or possibly a small to medium size business that doesn\'t have the need for a full time CISO. Another situation is where a CISO is gone, or they\'re creating a CISO role, and they believe they had somebody on staff who is capable of doing the role but needs some guidance. \xa0 What is a bad CISO? Usually they\'re not talking the same language as the business. Everyone tries to get to that language of talking risk, but really talking about the business. What does the business do? What are the crown jewels? What are those elements of the business that are core to protect? Whether it be data in a regulated industry, most industries would love to protect their brand. They don\'t want their brand drug through the mud in terms of a data breach. It\'s those types of things. \xa0It\'s really those situations where the CISO is either removed so far from the executive team or from the board of directors, that the voice of the CISO is never heard. \xa0 Is the CISO role measurably impossible? There are folks doing a fantastic job. They have what they need to get the job done and that\'s really the root of CISO success. It\'s budget, it\'s staffing, it\'s all of those core elements to a security program, but it\'s more than personal interaction with the business. There\'s an understanding of what the business does and what protection should be in place. \xa0You can\'t place a blanket over everything, it\'s impossible, it\'s expensive. You never have enough staff. You really have to pick and choose what you want to get done inside of your program. In a risk-based approach that makes sense for your business. Set the base line at an executive level. \xa0 Interaction with the Board It was just getting to know who I was talking to. In this case it was the board of trustees of a private state institution. Just understanding who the players were and getting to the point where I was talking at a very rudimentary level about what a security program was. \xa0There were no numbers for that initial meeting. It was really concepts. It was bringing some of the concepts of protecting the institution, protecting the brand. It\'s really a huge asset for them to consider from a protection standpoint. It was really setting a foundation of here\'s what we\'re trying to protect, here\'s the important things to the institution. Not so much asking for what I needed or statistics. It was very high level, get to know what the information security program is and what it does for the institution. \xa0You would want to be at least a little bit comfortable with standing in front of a group of folks and delivering a message. When you\'re helping create a presentation, there\'s really two in one. \xa0It\'s a larger presentation, that if you had all the time in the world--the set of slides that you would use, kind of walk through, and give people time to ask questions and be really open with your presentation. And then there\'s the scenario where you got to cut down to three minutes--that’s maximum two slides. \xa0It\'s really going through those two exercises together, continuously on almost any presentation you do, the long version and the short version. And deciding how you\'re going to deliver both of those messages. \xa0 Leadership during crisis The first message is that you want to be [physically] together, because [a data breach] is a serious situation and it\'s something that most everyone had never imagined could happen. So you want it to be together and at least give people an outlet to say, "Can you believe this happened? How could this happen?" And just give people an outlet as a leader. Number two is just to be calm. Nobody wants to see the leadership running around losing their cool, acting outside of character, and it just doesn\'t go well. It doesn\'t give a sense of calm to your staff so that they can deliver you know, the tasks and the activities they need to do to get to the root of the problem and fix the problem. \xa0You\'re always going to have gaps in your program. Yet, always document what the gaps are and certainly document what it would take to fill the gap at a minimal level and then at a perfect level. \xa0 Always have a plan It doesn’t have \xa0to be a three year plan, but it at least has to go 12 to 18 months for sure. Things move at light speed in IT and information security of course, we\'ve got to be moving the needle and we\'ve got to be heading in a direction which makes sense. Which means, there\'s milestones, goals, things to check the box on, that need to happen year in and year out. Make it at least an annual event that you get your own leadership team, your security leadership team, and even some folks in IT or your legal partners, HR and others, and determine what\'s next in a program. \xa0What are the business-aligned objectives in an information security program. How do they align with the business, are we protecting the right things? Are we investing the money in the right places? Create those plans, keep them up to date, keep them rolling forward. \xa0 Executive presentation and vetting issues Make sure you\'re getting a couple of trusted advisors on the leadership team if you\'re not on the leadership team. You\'re going to learn a lot from the folks that you work with and for, on the negative side and the positive side. Take as much as you can from both of those things, determine what your brand is going to be and how you\'re going to operate. Certainly with a slant toward being as positive as you can, helping people along the way. We need to really push people that want that leadership track. Push them toward what leadership is all about, push them toward humility, take risks, be innovative, and really inspire your folks to be better. When we start to talk about a strategic plan, a good leader has shown the way to get work done in an efficient way, gives the freedom to do work however they want to do, as long as they get to an outcome, and is helping them progress in their career. \xa0It\'s a two way street with trust. Your people need to trust you that you\'re doing the right things to lead whatever program their working on to a better place, and their career to a better place. The trust the opposite way is, you need to trust your people to be really smart. You need to have the trust in yourself that you can sit in a meeting and not be the smartest guy in the room anymore and have the humility to say I don\'t have that answer, but I\'ve got some really smart folks on my team that are going to get me that answer. \xa0You\'re going to have to work together. There\'s different roles of course, but if we can\'t treat each other the same, look at each other the same, and have that element of trust, it\'s really hard to move a program forward. \xa0 What’s the career path for a CISO? It\'s multifaceted. CISOs can go from being a CISO in a small organization to a medium or a large organization. There\'s a role as an executive advisor, virtual CISO role. There\'s lots of experiences once you\'re a CISO that you can bring to different groups of folks. As we progress in our careers and as we amass all of these experiences, all of us need to be more cognizant of how we give back to the security community. We\'re hypocritical in the way that we say that we have a resourcing problem, but we\'re too busy to do the educational things, to set up internship programs, to do the harder things to develop some of the next generation of security professionals. \xa0 Resources: Exabeam - Website Optiv Security - Website Steve Moore - LinkedIn Matt Klein - LinkedIn', 'chan_desc': 'The New CISO is hosted by Exabeam Chief Security Strategist, Steve Moore.

We spend a good deal of our time talking about how to avoid the “boomerang” effect that sends so many beginner freelancers back to the company they left.\xa0 In This Episode  What to consider before leaving an organization. Data from Briana’s research. The importance of autonomy and variety in work. How freelancing is positively impacting wage disparity for women. Self-management skills for freelancing.\xa0 How to brand yourself. How traditional employers can respond to the rise in freelance work. Characteristics to develop for freelancing success.  | Josh Bernoff is the author of a stellar book called Writing Without Bullshit: Boost Your Career by Saying What You Mean. The book is focused on making everyone a better writer in business. Most importantly, due to Josh’s background in the technology sector, he has a lot of history with an industry that produces arguably the most jargon, poorly written emails, blog posts, and messaging of any business sector.\xa0 This episode centers on different examples of how people can improve their business writing, report writing, and emails, alongside many other great writing topics. In This Episode  Josh’s background and his first insights into useful, clear writing. On meaningless platitudes. The importance of strong titles and file names. How to write a strong executive summary. How to craft a great email. Why paragraphs are the worst. How we got to the current standard of communication in our professional lives.

We discuss the launch of new products by sales teams, as well as some of the challenges that accompany these product launches. In addition, we cover the types of people who do the best at selling new products, the “shiny new thing” problem when selling to customers, and other gems that will make any company better at selling new products. To cap off the show, we talk about how B2B and sales topics have largely been ignored as a subject within academia.\xa0 In This Episode\xa0  The research that went into Dr. Steenburgh\'s analysis of innovation and product launches. The different type of salespeople you\'ll need for product launches. Why face-to-face meetings are important for selling new products. The characteristics of reps who succeed at selling new products and those who don\'t.

His Harvard Business Review article “Executives Fail to Execute Strategy Because They’re Too Internally Focused” put him our radar and led us to his fantastic book, Rising to Power. We tackle both the book and the HBR article in this interview. The crux of the episode--to borrow Ron’s phrase--is the ‘altitude sickness’ that all "rising" executives come across. Examples of this altitude sickness are: ineffective use of power, effective and ineffective communication and organization design, as well as how effectively they are looking at the competitive landscape to leverage that information and make their organizations more profitable, successful spaces. In This Episode\xa0  Ron’s professional background and his current work with Navalent. Managing the competitive context for executives. The dizzying dynamics of managing and leveraging portfolios. Organizational ‘compression’ and strategic thinking. Why saying no is so important. A few words on Millennials and intergenerational connection. Why an executive should link their strategy to their company’s budget. Telling executives the truths they don’t want to hear but need to hear. Organization design as a system. A breakdown of power and its dangers.  | If you don’t take care of your data, your marketing campaigns will have a lower ROI, sales teams will be starved for leads, and your company will miss it’s revenue targets. \xa0 On today’s episode, I chat with Ruth Stevens, who has spent the last 20 years helping enterprise and mid-market companies take better care of their data.\xa0Ruth has also co-authored an excellent book on the subject named B2B Data-Driven: Marketing, Sources, Uses, and Results.\xa0 \xa0 Ruth and I chat about several important topics.\xa0 \xa0 First, we tackle the challenge of data degradation.\xa0When the rate of change on nearly any customer or prospect data set is 4% to 6% per month, all companies have to address the problem, this presents.\xa0 \xa0 Second, we cover some thorny problems, out of a full set of 20+ in the book, that bedevils anyone who tries to deal with B2B data.\xa0 \xa0 We also talk about why she is “opt-out” vs. “opt-in” and why this is not just the correct legal position but the appropriate one for B2B marketing leaders to consider. \xa0 Finally, we talk about new types of data sets like intent data, along with a host of other topics. You can learn more about Ruth’s book here:  https://www.amazon.com/B2B-Data-Driven-Marketing-Sources-Results/dp/1933199172 | Organic reach on Facebook has plummeted over the years and B2B marketers need to adjust.\xa0 On today\'s episode, I chat with Peter Reitano, the Co-founder of Abacus, a digital marketing agency that specializes in leveraging Facebook and Instagram in a B2B context.\xa0 We discuss the challenges of finding organic reach through Facebook, the importance of vertical video and the importance of thumb stopper creative.

We first discuss the main archetypes of different superbosses (the iconoclasts, the nurturers, etc.) through a number of different examples of well-known business leaders. Then we get into various factors that make superbosses tick alongside some sentiments that are tantamount to treason when talking to a superboss. Sidney also shares how superbosses almost always leverage the apprenticeship model when it comes to growing new talent. In This Episode  What is a superboss? The research that went into the book, including hundreds of interviews. The three archetypes of superbosses. Confidence and why it matters in being a superboss. Competitiveness and imagination in the workplace. Integrity and being a superboss. Why authenticity is essential for becoming a good leader. On being a hands-on delegator. Why apprenticeship can’t be beat. Network development and talent spotting.  | Trust in B2B sellers is eroding. B2B buyers are increasingly looking towards third-party sites and influencers for reviews. Additionally, your sales and support teams may not be set up for success in building long-term trust with buyers.

What the “action office” was and how it impacted modern office design. Kristin’s take on the limited amount of square footage employees receive today for office space. Considerations that go into designing communal spaces in an office environment.

Nurturing your audience never stops. You have to build automation and processes to succeed in the eCommerce world. But don’t make the mistake of coming up with a complex system. When a complex system breaks, it’s difficult to figure out how to fix it. Some of the best systems are very simple. Listen to this episode to find out the strategies I’ve used to grow my audience and my business. Find out the best equation that results in higher revenue When you’re nurturing an audience, you’re trying to build goodwill and community. There’s a specific equation I like to use to explain how this works best: audience X goodwill X number of offers = revenue The size of an audience is the community you’ve built. The goodwill is the bond you’ve made with that audience. We all buy from people who we know, like, and trust. How much do they know, like, and trust you? With making offers, you don’t want too little or too much. The result is the amount of revenue you make from those three factors combined. Use this equation to help you remember the importance of building your audience and goodwill. You won’t be disappointed when you watch your revenue increase.\xa0 Why Q4 is the time to capitalize and build your audience Right now is the time to build up your audience and goodwill. It’s easier in the fourth quarter because the price of getting that audience is going up. You don’t want to have to pay premium prices to reach them. That’s why it’s vital to focus on the relationships you already have. People are already in the shopping mode so start now. Listen to this episode to help you define your unique selling proposition that will not only build your audience but boost your sales.\xa0 Define your lead nurturing strategy to build community I recently heard a speaker who did a good job building community. His methods are a good strategy for you to follow and implement. He told stories and used humor. He also “baked in” his propositions. This is KEY. Don’t forget to first define your five propositions:  Unique selling proposition Unique value proposition Unique experience proposition Unique safety proposition Unique irresistible offer  You MUST define these and use them every chance you get. In this episode, I tell you detailed steps on how to do this. Don’t miss out on this great opportunity. How to get the most out of what you already have Start with what you already have. If you only have ten emails - treat them like gold. When you have a small customer list, it’s easy to call each one or write them a personal note. This is the momentum you need to propel your business forward. Let me show you how to get the most traction when you start to build your audience. In this episode, I give step-by-step strategies on how you can make the most out of what you already have. Outline of This Episode  [1:28] Don’t miss out on opportunities to grow your eCommerce business [4:47] Find out why this fourth quarter is the prime time to build your audience [7:44] What’s the best strategy to build community? [11:32] How to get the most out of what you already have [14:22] Why reaching your problem-aware audience is key  Resources & People Mentioned  Episode 78 - Unlock The Secret To Success With Customer Follow Up  Connect With Bryan Bowman  Bryan’s website: https://www.ecomunderground.com/ On Facebook  | The number one thing sellers overlook is the importance of customer followup. It’s so vital to have a process in place to nurture these relationships. We spend so much time trying to get our customers. But once that happens, very few sellers follow up. Just as we need to take time to build our friendships, it’s the same in business. Strengthen those relationships with your customers. Listen to this episode to find out how you can do this and how it becomes the lifeblood of your business.\xa0 Remember the five states of awareness To nurture your customer relationships, you have to know the different touchpoints and states of awareness. The five states of awareness are detailed in the book Breakthrough Advertising. They include:  Unaware - people who don’t know they have a problem Problem aware - people who know they have a problem but don’t know a solution exists Solution aware - people who know they have a problem and that a solution exists but don’t know which product is the solution Product aware - people who know about the product but don’t know your product is the best one Most aware - once people know your product is the best they are most aware  Our goal as sellers is to get everyone to the “most aware” stage. But not many get there because very few end up making a purchase. Listen now to get great ideas and find out how to make this happen in your eCommerce business. How to capture your audience and keep them engaged\xa0 The first step of nurturing an audience is to get their attention. To get them in your sphere of influence, they need to know you have something valuable to say. A great initial touchpoint makes the potential buyer like your ideas and propositions. You need to put your best foot forward to get their attention. Once they’re in your sphere of influence, you can deliver content and nurture that relationship. Listen to this episode to hear detailed ideas on how to get your audience’s attention, and find out why consistency is key in nurturing that relationship. Why it’s important to encourage buyers to join a Facebook group The old saying is true, “birds of a feather flock together.” For example, cyclists hang out with other cyclists. When there’s a common interest, it draws people together. For this reason, you need to encourage buyers to join a group so excitement and momentum build, resulting in more sales. Facebook groups have grown for this reason. I like taking prospects and buyers and putting them into a Facebook group. Do this today and see how it impacts your sales. How to use consistent customer followup to boost your sales Post-purchase is a crucial time to use customer followup to your advantage. How are you going to keep those customers engaged? Remember, your best prospect is your existing customer so you have to make sure you take good care of them. It’s the same as building any other relationship. The nurturing process never stops. Don’t be like most sellers who make this mistake - once they get the prospect’s attention, they never nurture the relationship. Get creative and do something new to make your customers feel special. One of the most powerful marketing tools is simply by word of mouth. It’s vital to treat your customers well because they could become your biggest advocates. Treat them right and they become your brand ambassadors. That’s when your business can become profitable.\xa0 Outline of This Episode  [1:28] Find out the number one thing sellers overlook [4:13] How to draw your audience in and get their attention [5:27] Consistency is the key to content marketing [7:54] Encourage customers to join like-minded groups [9:47] Show special consideration to customers  Resources & People Mentioned  Breakthrough Advertising by Eugene Schwartz https://www.ecomunderground.com/klaviyo (affiliate link)  Connect With Bryan Bowman  Bryan’s website: https://www.ecomunderground.com/ On Facebook  | In this episode, I share some of the most effective email marketing strategies that will prove to be the game changers in your eCommerce business. There’s no need for a fancy system. All it takes is getting back to fundamentals. In eCommerce, it’s vital to focus on the basics of email marketing. So many business owners fail to put a system in place and lose potential customers. You MUST have templates in place and your emails must follow a certain sequence. Listen to find out what I do to ensure the most conversions. Are you doing your shoppers a favor or a disservice when it comes to your cart abandonment? The first of four email sequences you MUST have in place is the cart abandonment sequence. This may sound obvious but I’ve been surprised to learn most brand owners fail to capitalize here. Statistics show that 73% of retail shoppers WILL abandon the cart on any given website. But interestingly, 75% of shoppers said they fully intended to return and finish the purchase but simply got distracted. Do them a favor by sending that follow-up email, otherwise, you’re doing a disservice to your customers. Effective email marketing includes a welcome sequence\xa0 When someone first opts in and gives their contact information, it’s important to have a series of welcome emails prepared. I have a seven-day welcome series where I not only introduce my brand but also make an offer. Follow this welcome sequence and you’ll be surprised to see how well it converts. Use post-purchase emails to capitalize on your best prospect Your best prospect is your existing customer. That’s why the post-purchase sequence is so crucial. It’s shocking to find out how many brands don’t have this in place. You already have these customers in your sphere of influence - simply keep the conversation going. Learn how to keep them engaged with your brand and they’ll become your best repeat customer. Use the “win-back” campaign to re-engage your customers How can you get customers back? Use the “win-back” campaign. This is the time to throw everything at them - a product rebundle, an amazing discount or offer. Listen now to find out how to use these things to re-engage your customers. You’ll be surprised how well it works.\xa0 There are other possible sequences, but these four are the fundamental building blocks that matter. Apply these and you’ll be surprised to see how quickly your sales increase. Listen now to find out how to implement each sequence to your eCommerce business. Outline of This Episode  [1:17] Get back to the four fundamentals of email marketing [5:03] Learn the four critical email templates to have in place\xa0 [8:15] Re-engage your customers with the “win-back” sequence [9:37] Don’t forget the four pillars of business  Resources & People Mentioned  https://www.ecomunderground.com/klaviyo (affiliate link) Jack Nicklaus  Connect With Bryan Bowman  Bryan’s website: https://www.ecomunderground.com/ On Facebook  | One of your main goals as an eCommerce seller is maintaining a low bounce rate.

I’ve been reading Annie Duke’s book about making smarter decisions when you don't have all the facts. She’s a professional poker player and she emphasizes the importance of separating quality decisions from quality results. Although her book relates to the game of poker, listen to this episode to find out how I’ve applied this same concept in life and business. Refine your decision-making process, and as you do this, you’ll see better results.\xa0 Learn to accept that results in business are out of your hands A term in poker Duke refers to is called “resulting.” Resulting is described as the tendency for poker players to base the quality of their decisions on the quality of their results. An example of this can be seen in business. If your company hires a new CEO and things go well, the assumption is that it’s a result of the new CEO. If something goes poorly, you again assume it’s because of the decision to hire that CEO. We can make quality decisions, have a framework to follow, and then let go of results. Find out in this episode how both luck and skill play into this and why the results are out of your hands. Discover the importance of building a framework for decision-making in business In your eCommerce business, you can blindly test ads, but it’s not a good idea because that’s a poor decision.

Listen now to learn what we’ve done to help each other improve our businesses.\xa0 Remember the law of compounding Things that compound over time impact your business most. Analyze your decisions. Notice how rules and shortcuts have helped you. As your good decisions compound, good results will follow. That’s the big payoff from developing this framework for your decision-making.

This company is most consistent with following up with their email marketing. Email is still the number one marketing channel above all other mediums like SMS, phone calls, and direct mail.

But to reach that, you have to be willing to look a little foolish. Today on the golf course, I was reminded how so many aspects of my game relate to business. Both involve a lot of trial and error and permitting myself to look foolish. As I work on my golf swing, I have to go way beyond what feels comfortable. I may look foolish as I hit some crazy shots, but through those failures, I’m creating opportunities for that perfect swing. Listen to this episode to find out how this relates to business.\xa0 Make minor changes to get HUGE results Just like my golf game, I can make minor changes in business for potentially great gains. I have to be willing to fail forward and learn from mistakes. Be willing to fail and look foolish. Trying new things in business is hard to execute initially, but it may be the best steps toward success. Listen now to hear how the greatest success comes through failure.\xa0 Remove the risk of big losses to go for greater gains In the last episode, I talked about building an antifragile business, one that can’t be easily broken and gets stronger from stress. Learn how to build that kind of business. And as you build antifragility, you’ll want to experience new things and find the big wins in your business. But to do this, you have to be willing to look foolish. This may mean you lose at times. This is fine as long as you remove the risk of total catastrophic loss. Listen now to find out how this works. Remember the Barbell Strategy to balance your eCommerce business Also in the previous episode, I talked about how crucial the Barbell Strategy is and how to apply it to your business. This strategy eliminates the risk of catastrophic loss on one end. On the other end, you can be bold, take risks, and look foolish. This has been a huge lesson for me. Listen now to learn the importance of working within reason in your business. Small business advantages you can count on Those of us in small business have the opportunity to do things on our own terms. Take advantage of that liberty. It would be different if we had a multi-million dollar company with a large staff. There’s a lot more pressure in that scenario. Don’t try to be “big” and miss out on one of the greatest strengths of small business - the chance to experiment, to look foolish by choice. We have the opportunity for huge gains by doing something uncomfortable. But it’s those very things that are moving us in the direction to find that big win. Outline of This Episode  [0:39] Great gains in business can come through failure [3:43] How looking foolish can result in great gains in eCommerce [5:41] Apply the Barbell Strategy to reap the benefits  Resources & People Mentioned  eCom Underground, Episode 70 - Find Out How Volatility In Business Can Kill Profits Or Create Opportunities  Connect With Bryan Bowman  Bryan’s website: https://www.ecomunderground.com/ On Facebook  | In this episode, I talk about volatility in business and how, if channeled properly, can radically change your eCommerce business by strengthening it. I’m talking about building an antifragile business, which is something that cannot be easily broken. When something is fragile, it falls apart when stress is applied. Anything unexpected, any volatility will break it - like pressure put on a crystal glass. You may think the opposite of fragile is robust, unbreakable. But the opposite is more than that. It’s indifferent. It doesn’t get any better or worse. So by definition, the opposite of fragile is something that gets stronger from stress. It gains from disorder.\xa0 Take, for example, wind as the stressor. It can blow out a candle flame because it’s fragile. But that very same wind - that same stressor - can make a fire stronger. It will fuel that flame. In business, you want to be more like that flame, to get fueled by stressors and not break by the stress. That’s what I talk about in detail here. Listen now to find out how you can become the best antifragile business. What is the “weight” of the Barbell Strategy? The Barbell Strategy is a concept outlined by Nassim Taleb in his book Antifragile. This book is a must-read for anyone in business. His strategy works and is one of the best opportunities for success in your business. Think of a barbell - it’s a bar with weights on either end. The main point he proposes is that no decision in business should be middle-ground. Middle decisions are a waste of time and they make your business fragile. Listen now to find out a detailed explanation of what this means and how you can avoid catastrophic loss in your eCommerce business. Why marketplace dependency is the biggest liability in your business If you’re completely dependent on any one marketplace - no matter what it is - that’s the biggest liability in your business because it’s a risk for catastrophic loss. It is so important for you to keep building an audience, building rapport, and moving the levers in your business. Find out how to create a system that eliminates catastrophic loss. I show you how to aggressively take on risks. You may have some losses, but my strategy opens up possibilities for great gains and over time, you’ll win.\xa0 Find out how my golf game can impact your eCommerce strategy\xa0 I started applying this antifragile approach to my golf game. This applies to any sport, but especially to golf. I’ll teach you how to avoid terrible losses in your game - things like going out of bounds or losing your ball. I get aggressive in golf, but I first eliminate the chance for catastrophic loss to open up greater opportunities. There’s some volatility, but if you follow my detailed steps in this episode, I will not only improve your golf game, I’ll show you how to transfer that same strategy for success in your business! How to build an antifragile eCommerce business To be successful, it’s crucial to think seriously about strategies to build your business. I talk about this a lot in our intensive and you can learn more if you sign up for that. There are two primary things you must focus to build an antifragile business - monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and building your audience. If sales completely stopped, that makes you highly volatile. That’s why you must have MRR to avoid that. It’s a guaranteed amount that serves as your baseline and helps to avoid a total loss. The same thing with building your audience and nurturing that list to control the process. Find out in this episode about a mission-based company that has done this well. People want to connect with brands and make decisions that feel mutually beneficial. That’s why building an audience is key and makes your business antifragile.

Those conversations shaped a new perspective on how and why the role of the CCO is at a pivotal moment. Above all, the CCO is a crucial leader in enterprise transformation, which is in many cases an existential proposition for their companies.\xa0 Through our research, we introduce a new wrinkle to traditional stakeholder engagement models through CommTech. We also focus on three key dimensions of Corporate Character the CCO can use as a lever within the C-Suite: corporate brand stewardship, corporate culture and societal value creation.\xa0 We also explain how we will translate the new research into digestible, easy-to-learn formats, starting with Progression Paths.\xa0 Thank you for listening!

On this edition of The New CCO, we revisit a conversation from the 2018 Page Spring Seminar between Harold and Becky Edwards, now the CCO at Schneider Electric, who was then with the International Olympic Committee.

Interviewed by former IBM Chief Brand Officer and SVP Jon Iwata, Tony discusses the brand transformation effort he’s leading at GM alongside CEO Mary Barra. Facing disruption from new players such as Lyft, Uber, and Tesla, GM has had to rethink everything from its business model to its role in society. Tony has led the redefinition of the enterprise, starting with its brand and culture. He, along with GM’s senior leadership team, developed a new aspirational goal for the company - Zero Crashes, Zero Emissions, and Zero Congestion - which now serves as its north star. Tony details how he leverages his responsibility for the corporate brand to influence other parts of the business in ways that bring that brand to life. He also explains the emerging field of CommTech and how he’s used data and new technology systems to reach the stakeholders that matter most. | In the past, Communications was largely media relations and speechwriting. While technology has helped make our function more strategic and impactful, we are on the cusp of a major transformation of how it works - what our teams look like, the roles it includes, the skills it requires, and the ways it operates. On this edition of The New CCO, we discuss the emerging notion of CommTech with one of its pioneers, Daniel Jörg, Head of Digital Marketing & Research at Farner Consulting in Zurich. Daniel has spent the last 20 years taking the Communications function through a period of technological experimentation that has resulted in what he views as the function of the future. He walks us through his journey, what he’s learned along the way, and how his team is blending new tech with new ways of working to drive real business outcomes. | Enterprises face severe disruption, whether via technology, business model, new competition, etc. Indeed, in order to keep up, organizations must answer fundamental questions about the nature of their business, starting with their people. “What kind of culture do we need to compete in our industry? What does it look like, feel like, sound like? What are the base skills our people possess? Where do they come from?” These are some of the questions Reggie Walker, Chief Commercial Officer at PwC, has wrestled with while helping to lead the enterprise\'s communications function over the past three years. He’s also helped spur a critical organization-wide effort around digital upskilling to better align PwC’s people with its business strategy. He’s also unified the Communications, Sales and Marketing functions, streamlining an operation that was once disparate entities. On this episode, we’ll learn more about each of these initiatives from Reggie and how they ladder up to a new kind of CCO role that’s swiftly changing in order to adapt to new disruptive factors.

For instance, what if we took the same approach to training and leadership development? What if there was an interactive way to ask employees what they’d do in unusual real-life situations? As Jody and I discuss in this episode, being creative with our team building can go a long way not only in improving our quality standards but employee morale as well. | When we think about creativity, we often think of select professions and skillsets. For instance, one might associate an accounting job as non-creative and a designer job as creative. But as I’ve been learning, creativity isn’t just artistic prowess modeled on a stage or Shark Tank, but a universal experience. As I discuss in this episode, even if our jobs lack innovation, we can still define environments and scopes to solve problems and improve processes; hence, why we should all see our roles as creative contributors, whether we’re making the ‘magic’ or setting the table for it. | In past episodes, you may recall Jody and I discussing the Eisenhower matrix, a grid separating tasks into four components based on urgency and importance. Returning to that topic, I’d like to explore organization fitness through a new lens, the lens of confidence. Having talked to Dan Miller, author of “48 Days”, last month, our examination of importance must not only include urgency, but what we’re confident in doing, what we’re excellent in doing, and things only we can do. As I explain in this episode when you filter your skills through what can’t be delegated, bought, or downloaded, you can spend the appropriate amount of time employing them. | As business leaders, meaningful conservations are critical. \xa0 While many think these conservations are functions of position, in reality, the most important interactions are ignited by an approachable reputation. Granted, this is easier said than done in a ‘self-aware’ era. However, if we want to make a difference, then we must focus on people to know their situation and gauge what type of questions we should be asking. Think of it this way: If the success of our corporations hinge on positive exchanges, why not put yourself in position to give and receive advice? Why not ask yourself, ‘What do I want my reputation to be and what am I doing to reinforce that reputation?’ As I discuss in this episode, by keeping these questions on the front burner, you can establish purposeful connections with employees, clients, and potential partners. | For many, mentorship is a complicated topic. From finding time to connect to knowing who to look for, no question, the pursuit of a role model can seem like an uphill battle at times. However, as I discuss in this episode, to be intentional in seeking guidance from mentors is to know who to look for and how to look for them. After all, mentors come in many forms all carrying a unique blend of knowledge, habit, and perspective. To tap into their insight, one must first know why they’re inquiring it in the first place. For instance, do you want to know how to run a business or know how to strategically network a particular function? While the difference may seem moot, by knowing and communicating your intent effectively with a potential mentor, you can better the odds a one-time meeting can become a confiding relationship. | After hearing from Dan Miller in our last episode, Jody and I welcome Nicole Cutrufo, Founder and CEO at Doitwell, to share her story. A graduate of the Rosen College of Hospitality Management, Nicole worked various guest service gigs in Orlando and Rome before started her own consulting company in 2018. Having settled a new position, Nicole explains how the power of self-education through small life changes ultimately paved the way for her decision to start Doitwell.\xa0 As a young parent working for herself, troubleshooting is a constant, but the positives of pursuing change, as she explains, continues to fuel her learning. | On this special episode, Dan Miller, author of “48 Days”, joins Jody and I to discuss his background and leadership philosophies. According to Miller, one of the biggest challenges vocationals face is managing change. While many work in streams of success, not all operate in their uniqueness. As a result, when risk is confronted, confusion arises due to a lack of self-awareness. Granted, it makes sense for people to equate vocation to skillset. But as Miller contends, when people are willing to connect purpose to passion, the idea of risk can be better perceived as a progression of focus. By knowing the difference, people can find the confidence to make the right change at the right time. | This is part two to our previous episode “Four Keys to Implementing Change” but in this episode, we’re talking about what needs to happen to make these changes actually happen. The fact is as we all pursue our individual endeavors, we're all bonded by the inevitable challenges waiting for us. The question is when troubleshooting situations arise, how do we manage them? How do we cope when we're forced to go with the flow? As I discuss in this episode, whether we talk internal communications, customer engagement, or backup solutions, there are many ways a business can suffer systemically; however, for each potential problem, there is a key to implement the proper correction. \xa0One exercise is to imagine the worst-case scenario and come up with all the ways you can prevent it from happening and brainstorm ideas of how to fix those scenarios We talk about needing your designers to understand what the user experience needs to be like, thinking about redundancies and backups when the system isn’t working, and the importance of having a mode when everything goes away you can still offer your customers a great experience. | Change is continuous. As technology improves, our organizations will have to adjust.\xa0 Implementing change is never easy.\xa0 At Disney, we walk the line between doing what has made us successful and changing our products to remain relevant.\xa0 When we implemented a big change at Disney, I learned there are four areas you have to address to make sure change is successful.\xa0 Four aspects of change; Make sure cast members understood introducing new technology does not mean our organizational beliefs change.\xa0 Invest in the teams and people who will make the change happen.\xa0 Meet people where they are. Not everyone is ready for change. Be ready for people who are scared, concerned, not ready, or those who fully embrace a change.\xa0 Communication is key. You have to talk to people constantly. Don't surprise people by change. If you feel you are communicating too much, you are probably just getting started.\xa0 | As mentioned in past podcasts, knowing your audience is essential to quality leadership. To better a product or service, oftentimes, this can’t happen without customer engagement. But as I’ve been recently reminded, sometimes the best way to know an audience is to be open to spontaneous interaction. Such is the case with this episode, where I sit down with two of my biggest fans, August and Gretel Maberry, to share discuss Disney, food, athletics, and extra-curricular activities.", 'chan_desc': 'Creating and maintaining a magical culture in any organization takes dedication and commitment.

In the wake of the recent\xa0retirement of National Intelligence Director Dan Coats and the resignation of principal deputy director Sue Gordon,\xa0Chertoff Group Principal\xa0Charles Allen\xa0discusses what the Office of the Director of National Intelligence means to the security of the United States. Allen, who had a 40-year career with the CIA, talks about the importance of the office and the type of leader that the role requires.\xa0 | The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee reflected on today’s national security challenges during a recent hearing titled “18 Years Later: The state of Homeland Security After 9/11.”\xa0 Chertoff Group Executive Chairman\xa0Michael Chertoff, who served as the second U.S. Homeland Security Secretary, testified about the collective work done to prevent this type of event from occurring again and where further investment and attention is needed to protect the safety and security of the American people.\xa0 | It’s been nearly 20 years since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

The Chertoff Group’s Adam Isles discusses vulnerabilities in election security and strategies to guard against attacks with Philip Reitinger, president and CEO of the Global Cyber Alliance. Reitinger talks about some basic steps to cut your cyber risk and cautions that the Internet of Things will present new challenges that we’ve yet to grasp. | Attacks on the U.S. election system and those around the world are designed to sow doubt and undermine confidence, creating challenges for democracies around the world. Adam Isles and Michael Chertoff discuss how we protect the integrity of elections – from campaigns, voters, and the voting system itself. It requires a public-private partnership, and individual citizens have a role to play. Chertoff cautions that we must use our imagination to prepare for the attacks we haven’t seen.\xa0 | Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of computer systems and algorithms to simulate human responses and then learn and adapt. It holds great potential to bring innovation across a number of sectors.\xa0 But it also raises a host of moral, legal and ethical questions. The Chertoff Group’s Paul Rosenzweig discusses the challenges and dilemmas this technology creates. How far are we willing to go in putting our faith in AI, and can we design it in a way that aligns with our values? | Software has traditionally been a black box when it comes to knowing what’s inside.\xa0 Allan Friedman, director of Cybersecurity Initiatives\xa0at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, discusses the Software Component Transparency initiative and efforts to establish a software bill of materials. It’s akin to a list of ingredients associated with a particular piece of software to help stakeholders make better risk-management decisions.

During this conversation, Shelly shares…  Why she hired young attorneys who were right out of law school and why this added so much value to her business. How she made big pivots in her business when things didn’t feel right or weren’t in line with her vision. How she doubled down servicing a very special niche of business, focusing on tech and ecommerce businesses and how that made her incredibly valuable in the marketplace. How she went about establishing herself as a trusted attorney in a city where she wasn’t networked at all!\xa0 I could fish where the fish were or I could fish where the fishermen were, she says.\xa0 So brilliant!  The powerful theme of this conversation is how Shelly has always been very clear about her end game.\xa0 And when you’re clear about where you want to go, she says, then you can open yourself up to all the possibilities on how to get there.\xa0\xa0 You can find out more about Shelly here: www.aegislaw.com. | For many, many years now, I have talked about a few foundational practices that I have used to get things done.\xa0 To be productive and efficient.\xa0\xa0 Time blocking, batching, focusing your energy, prioritizing your tasks, etc.\xa0\xa0 And they’re all really smart strategies and have worked in a nice combination for me over the years.\xa0 Until recently.\xa0\xa0 Blocking out time, dedicating certain times and days for certain activities, batching content creation...none of it’s working for me right now. With an 8 month old baby and a 3 ½ year old daughter, mommying has taken up more of my time than usual.\xa0 More times than I can count, my perfectly planned blocked times have been pushed aside to accommodate sick kids, changing schedules or have even been exchanged for “catch up” time for me to chill and recover before I can shift my energy into business.\xa0 My ideas to batch content and create 4 podcast episodes at once are thrown out the window because I am exhausted after just one interview or writing just one meditation for the Women’s Meditation Network.\xa0 I found myself angry and bitter and consistently beating myself up that things weren’t working the way I wanted them to and that I couldn’t get the things done I needed. So, I had to find another way. And then...I remembered a conversation I had with Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Estes - the author of the foundational Feminist book, Women Who Run With the Wolves.\xa0 I happen to run into her at a podcasting conference when I was pregnant with my first and so we spent some time talking about how to make the time to work and raise kids.\xa0\xa0 She told me, “I wrote that book in 5 minute increments here, 20 minute increments there...any time I could find while I was raising my kids.”\xa0\xa0 That concept stuck with me all these years and I wanted to bring it to you as a new way to approach getting things done.\xa0 If batching content and blocking time aren’t conducive to your lifestyle right now, how can you move things forward in little “bitesize” moments?\xa0\xa0 For me, it requires TRUSTING that I will get things done, instead of being so rigid on the to-do’s of the day and week.\xa0 And also...and this is probably even more important...letting go of the expectation that I’ll get multiple things done at once.\xa0\xa0 Last night, I had a bit of energy after I put the kids to sleep and so I immediately turned on my computer and wrote a meditation.\xa0 It felt so good to get it done. In my old way of doing things, I would tell myself to stay there and write 2 more so I could batch and be efficient.\xa0 But you know what? I was exhausted by the time I was done, so I let go of the expectation to do more and just let that bitesize work be enough.\xa0\xa0 I believe that ALL time management and productivity strategies are wonderful and can work for you at any given season of your life.\xa0 Perhaps working in bitesize moments can be helpful for you right now or can be integrated into how you’re moving your business forward! PS: If you’re currently stuck in your business or just not feeling like you’re living into the full potential it has, then I invite you to book a 2 Hour Intensive Strategy Session with me!\xa0 In 2 hours, we can get clear about what it is you want and help you focus on the strategies that help you get there.

Nicholas and I discuss:  His childhood discovery aged 16 that inspires his work What led him to theatre as a spiritual practice The work and his experience as a co-founder of Olivier Mythodrama What he means by presence and how he defines leadership presence What it takes to help leaders and teams shift their concept of reality How he works with teams His work at IMD in preparing leaders for the future His vision for cultures of presence  More on Nicholas: Over the last 15 years Nicholas has gained an international reputation for his transformational coaching and leadership development seminars for leaders and teams. The clients he has served include FedEx, Rolls Royce, Swiss Re, Centrica, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Amdocs, Intel, Motorola, Microsoft, eBay and Lafarge, as well as the UK Permanent Secretaries and several cabinet ministers. He bridges the worlds of creative, personal, spiritual and professional development in a uniquely powerful, relevant and accessible way. In his first career Nicholas was a theatre director. He taught acting at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and directed his own theatre company. He has spent 30 years researching the theory and the practice of ‘the zone’ of peak performance, and studying multiple mind/body disciplines. In 1998 he became a Visiting Fellow at the Cranfield School of Management, and in 2001 he left the theatre to co-found the arts-based leadership development consultancy Olivier Mythodrama. In 2013 he founded his own consultancy, CORE PRESENCE.

How are you this morning? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] I am great, thanks for having me. I\'m excited to be here. \xa0 [Naber] Thank you. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Although it\'s actually evening my time. \xa0 [Naber] (laughs) Well happy evening, and good evening. So what I think we\'ll do is first talk through a little bit of your personal story, get into you as a kid, some of the decisions you made, interests you had, et cetera, and then we\'ll start to lean into probably 80, 90% of what we\'ll talk about which is your professional jumps, and some of the superpowers that you\'ve acquired, accumulated along the way, and some of the things that you\'re great at, and know a lot about. And we\'ll talk through some of the methods and mindsets that you have around those things. Sound okay? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, sounds great. \xa0 [Naber] Okay cool. Let\'s start back in Jersey, where it all started. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Oh boy. \xa0 (Naber laughing) \xa0 [Naber] 25, 35, minutes outside of Newark it seems. Tell us a little bit about you as a kid. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] So, I think I was the ultimate nerdy kid. I read all the time and everywhere, and I was horrible at sports. I got kicked off of six sports teams in high school, actually six. \xa0 [Naber] You counted. [Danielle Peretore] About half for skill. Oh yeah, I mean about half of them were for skill and about half of them for having a bad attitude. So, you know, kinda evened out. But yes, I read a lot of books. I went to a lot of really nerdy camps. I went to computer camp, I went to science camp, I went to math camp, all of the above. \xa0 [Naber] Yes, this is so cool. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Is it, is it so cool, or did I have a tiger mom? I\'m not really sure. \xa0 (Naber laughing) \xa0 [Naber] Fair enough, fair enough. So maybe both are true. This is great. Tell us about a couple of the camps that you enjoyed the most and why. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Which camps did I enjoy, actually I loved computer camp because you could play games all day. Actually, you weren\'t supposed to but I did. Do you remember that game Frogger that was really big in the 90s? \xa0 [Naber] Absolutely. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Of course, of course. Okay great. Yeah, I loved Frogger, so I played a lot of Frogger there. I also learned how to code in HTML, back in, this must have been like 1998. So I was ahead of the curve and then I totally lost it, never became a coder, you know my mom\'s dreams of me becoming a female engineer just went out the window. That\'s a story for later,\xa0but anyway I coded these, Danielle\'s home page, it was always rainbow and sparkles, whatever. So yeah, I loved computer camp. \xa0 [Naber] Very cool. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, yeah. \xa0 [Naber] And what was the first way that you made money? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] First way I made money. The first actual paycheck I had for the summer before I went to college, my parents were, you know I\'d been a nerdy kid just studying all through high school. And so they were very determined, they said that I needed to have a menial job. It was incredibly important to them that I understood what life would look like if I dropped out of college. And so they signed me up to work at a, it was like a shack that made french fries. So I made french fries and like chicken dinos. It was at like a, I think it was at a local pool. Yeah, it was at a local pool. And I spent my summer mopping floors, lots of clogged toilets.\xa0It was great, it was great. By the time I got to college, I was like, yep I\'m gonna figure this thing out, I\'m gonna stick it out. I don\'t want there to be any more clogged toilets in my future. \xa0 (Naber laughing) [Naber] That\'s a good story. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, my parents had a little bit of a shock and awe strategy in terms of raising us. They were like yeah, you don\'t wanna do the things that we think you should do, or that you should do, let us shock you. Like, throw you in the deep end. \xa0 [Naber] That\'s funny. Was that the way it was for all our siblings as well? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Oh my gosh, yes. I think my other sisters, one of them worked, she actually, she was going to Harvard and then she spent two summers scooping ice cream. Where she got in trouble because apparently her ratio of ice cream to sprinkles was not right, and it was pretty funny when then she had to explain to them, she\'s like, "I promise I can do this. "I\'m going to Harvard next year." \xa0 (Naber laughing) \xa0 [Naber] All right, great. And one last question, and we\'ll move on. What was your personality like as a kid? How would you describe it? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Well, believe it or not, I didn\'t talk really, as a kid. This is shocking to anyone who knows me now, but I was silent. I didn\'t talk to anyone, except my parents, and I really didn\'t like other kids. I was not into it. I just wanted to hang out with the adults. I basically wanted to be left alone and reading all day. I didn\'t wanna sweat. Sports was just a no go,\xa0I didn\'t really wanna be outside. I was like an 80-year-old woman as a 10-year-old. \xa0 [Naber] Interesting. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah. \xa0 [Naber] Were you always like that, like did your parents say that you were like that when you were really small, like when you were a child? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yes, yes. Yes, I was always like that. I never, there\'s all these pictures of me as a kid where all the other kids are together and I\'m in the corner by myself not talking to anyone. Yeah, but it\'s funny, as I got older, so my middle sister used to be the really talkative one and so she would answer questions for me and whatever, and then we totally flipped\xa0and now I talk all the time, I always wanna talk. And my middle sister is really quiet and wants to be left alone. \xa0 [Naber] Well, you\'re making up for lost time with words, I love it. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] I mean, yeah it\'s been about half my life that I\'ve been making up for lost time so I should probably pump the brakes a little bit. \xa0 (Naber laughing) \xa0 [Naber] Fair enough. All right, so you\'re getting out of high school, you\'re making the decision to go\xa0to uni, why Brown University? And why cognitive neuroscience and Brazilian Portuguese studies? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Oh God, that\'s the question of the century. Why Brown, I\'m wearing my Brown sweatshirt right now actually. I went to Brown, well really \'cause it was the best school I got into and as I said I had a tiger mom. So there wasn\'t much negotiation there. However, I loved Brown. I loved everything about Brown. Brown is just such a weird, wacky, wonderful place. There are no requirements, you take whatever you want. The weirder you are the better. I was considered so normal at Brown. And it was not cool, you know, it was not cool that I was normal. My friends from Brown are, they\'re just doing weird cool stuff. Brown was the best. I just had my 10-year reunion and it was a dream, I loved it. I think I got there and I was like, oh it\'s a bunch of weird kids who wanna sit in a corner and read, like me, great. \xa0 [Naber] Why cognitive neuroscience, and why Brazilian Portuguese studies? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Also great questions. So cognitive neuroscience, as I\'ve said like 10 times during this conversation, I had a tiger mom, she really wanted me to get a science degree, and I did not wanna take Organic Chemistry. So I literally found the one degree I could get that did not require me to take Organic Chemistry and I signed myself up. But that\'s the funny side of the story, which is very true, it\'s very true. But I also, I\'ve just always been really interested  in why people do the things they do. It\'s part I think why I work with sales teams, which we\'ll get into, but I love it. Like what drive people, why do people make this decision, why do you do this thing that makes no sense, that\'s totally irrational. And so I got there because I was trying to appease my mom and also not do what she wanted at the same time. And then I stayed here because I really liked learning about that. \xa0 [Naber] Very cool. And you\'re at Brown, thinking about making your move into the real world, \xa0your first jump out of school. Tell us about your professional ride so far. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Sure, yeah. So I graduated Brown in 2009\xa0 and that just goes to say that the world was ending when I graduated. It was basically like, whatever job you got you held on for dear life. And so I got really lucky, I interned at BCG, the Boston Consulting Group, management consulting, during my summer, my junior year summer. And honestly I did \'cause that I didn\'t know what else to do. You know that\'s the thing that\'s, I\'m not gonna say all of us, but so many college kids who don\'t know what they wanna do, they get tricked. It\'s like, go into management consulting, I\'m gonna get to do a lot of things. When actually you\'re gonna get to do one thing, which is run an Excel model and put it into PowerPoint slides. So yeah, signed\xa0myself up on that train. I did my summer at BCG, and then came back and was like, well there are\xa0literally no other jobs. So I went there full time. I joined the BCG New York office, I moved right to Manhattan after I graduated college. It was actually, a funny sidebar, my roommate was, she an amateur boxer training for the Golden Gloves and her boyfriend who lived with us was the starting linebacker for the New York Giants. So it like a real, yeah, I know. And then there\'s me.\xa0You guys can\'t see me, but I\'m under five feet tall. So it was a real trip. \xa0 (Naber laughing) \xa0 Otherwise, they were great, but yeah. So then I was living in New York, working at BCG, and frankly, I just didn\'t love the buttoned-up culture. It just did not fit me. So I did it, I got through kind of paying my dues there, and then I was like, I don\'t wanna wear a suit to work anymore. And I was a kid from New Jersey, I had big hair at the time, big hoop earrings, I had a Jersey accent, and I was like, this is not my scene. So anyway. I had a great experience there, I\'m really happy, I learned awesome skills, but then I jumped from there. I had always loved California and had done a bunch of trips there when I was younger and loved San Francisco, and so \xa0LinkedIn reached out to me. They were looking, it was right before they were about to IPO, and they were looking for someone who spoke Portuguese, and I studied abroad in Brazil in college, \'cause they were about to open the Brazil office, and so I was like, all right, I\'m outta here. Flew across the country with two suitcases, lived in a basically condemned apartment building as you do when you\'re 22 years old and moved across the country. And it was super fun. So I was at\xa0LinkedIn for about two years through an awesome period of their growth. They went from I think about a thousand employees to about five thousand by the time I left, it was over two years, it was wild. LinkedIn went public and I was still trying to figure out where the cafeteria was. It was just such a crazy experience. And I had no idea how crazy what I was living through was at the time but I had the chance to work with really awesome people there. And then I decided that so, back to tiger mom, my mom had signed me up for the GMAT when I was in college during a \xa0break. She was basically like, you don\'t need time off, you\'re just gonna take the GMAT. And so my\xa0GMAT score expired like I had to use it or lose it. \xa0 [Naber] Oh no. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] So I applied to business school, went off to HBS for two years,\xa0 and then came back, after HBS I was recruited by my boss from LinkedIn, so a company called NerdWallet. And then I was recruited from Nerdwallet by another boss from LinkedIn, his name is Christian, he\'s now the CEO of Glassdoor to Glassdoor. And here I am. \xa0 [Naber] Excellent. So let\'s pull up here. And we\'ll talk about a couple of different things. One is, you\'ve been at some great companies. And you\'ve been at those companies through the prime of part of their hyper-growth phases. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yes. \xa0 [Naber] And one of the things that I\'d love to hear from you is around, specifically the biz ops and strategy superpowers that each one of those businesses have. So let\'s start with LinkedIn. What was LinkedIn\'s superpower, what is something that they did extremely well, better than the rest, that you said like, this is the thing that they were elite at, from a business opt and strategy perspective that you lived through, that every company should have, whether it is natural or learned? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, so I don\'t know if this is technically biz ops and strategy, so tell me if I\'m going down the wrong path, but something that I think that LinkedIn did incredibly well, and credit to their CEO Jeff Weiner, is they defined a mission and vision, and managed to use that \xa0both in communicating externally, like it was very clear what LinkedIn was here to do and what they were looking to be, and also internally. They drove it down through the ranks internally in a way that there is no way that anyone who worked at LinkedIn, from the most senior levels\xa0down to someone who was on a contract basis, didn\'t understand the purpose of what they were doing there every day. And I thought that was truly exceptional. When I first started at LinkedIn I was young, it was my second job. I didn\'t really have much experience at different kinds of companies, and even I knew from the minute I walked in that door,\xa0 this is what we\'re here to do. This is my job today, and this is how I\'m impacting both LinkedIn and the world.\xa0 \xa0 [Naber] That\'s great. Okay, while we\'re on LinkedIn. What were a couple of the coolest projects\xa0you worked on at that time? There\'s a lot of different definitions for biz ops and not necessarily for strategy, but a lot of different definitions and ways that one would kind of ring fence or define biz ops. And as we go through each of these companies and talk about what they\'re great at, I\'d also love to hear some of the really cool one or two projects you worked on. So at LinkedIn, what were some of the coolest one or two projects that you worked on? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, \xa0sure. So I worked for a guy at LinkedIn, he was a VP of biz ops, his \xa0name\xa0was Dan Yoo. He\'s an incredible, incredible person. He\'s been my mentor for a long time. He wrote my recommendations for business school, recruited me to NerdWallet. And he, I think arguably, really did a lot of the definition of what biz ops is today. And there are two different types of Biz Ops teams. Biz ops evolved a bit later in the tech lifecycle, as tech was a bunch of small companies, you don\'t really get a bunch of MBAs running around.\xa0 And there\'ve now been companies with two different versions of biz ops. One is the dedicated biz ops model, where you have a team that is, you have biz ops for all the different leaders of the organization. Biz ops for products, biz ops for sales, biz ops for marketing. That\'s Dan Yoo\'s view of the world, and what it looked at LinkedIn and NerdWallet. And Glassdoor is similar but slightly different. It\'s more of a centralized team that works on broad, cross-department initiatives instead of having a biz ops partner exactly devoted to marketing and only what the priorities are of that marketing leader or the sales leader. It becomes a bit broader and you’ve projects that really no one else can get done, \'cause they don\'t stay on all those different teams. \xa0 [Naber] What are the strengths of both of those models? Just quick interjection. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah. I think the strengths, it\'s a really good question. So I think there\'s a lot of pretty obvious strengths to the dedicated biz ops business partner model \'cause then you are literally infusing really smart strategic thinking throughout the whole organization. What I always recommend, what I don\'t think is great, is when you do that and then have those\xa0teams actually report up through the functions, they report up through product or through\xa0marketing, \'cause then you lose that connection. What\'s awesome is to have a biz ops for\xa0marketing person thinking with the biz ops for product person, applying unified frameworks. So if you have a centralized team that\'s dedicated to the different parts of the business, what you end up doing is infusing that thinking through the organization, in actually a holistic way. But the downside of that model is, sometimes companies just kind of aren\'t big enough to bear it. If you think about the background of someone who\'s a biz ops or strategy person, they\'re someone who likely has, they may have an MBA, they\'ve thought about leadership, they\'ve thought about strategic thinking, they think about the path forward for any organization. Having a biz ops leader parallel with every single leader of a different business unit or a different function, it can be overkill. And so I think it\'s really dependent on both the company\'s stage and size, and also how the company functions. You know, do things really get done centrally, is there central strategic thinking, or is it more that you wanna infuse strategic thinking, but you wanna make sure that you\'re not overdoing it as well. \xa0 [Naber] Excellent. Okay, sorry to interrupt your thought, carry on. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, so at LinkedIn and NerdWallet, they were both run by the same guy, \xa0by Dan Yoo, and so they were much more the centralized team, but dedicated business partner model. Biz ops for product, biz ops for marketing, biz ops for sales, and then teams underneath them. And then at Glassdoor, it is a little bit different. So it\'s a stellar team, it\'s super smart people, but they work a bit more on cross-functional products. So we\'ll have someone who\'s biz ops for all international, they own our international expansion strategy. Then they\'ll have biz ops for our jobs marketplace, and our jobs marketplace under rides, it touches product, it touches marketing, it touches sales. But really no one else other than the biz ops teams could own these areas, because they\'re centralized, they\'re super smart, and they\'re really close to the executive teams, they can get things done. \xa0 [Naber] Okay, let\'s wrap LinkedIn. So at LinkedIn, can you give us maybe an example of a really cool, nerdy project, fun project you worked on LinkedIn that you think was, maybe either the biggest project you worked on or the most fun project you worked on. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, the answer to those is probably the same. So I built our expansion strategy into Latin America, which it is was funny, I was originally hired to LinkedIn too, partially \'cause I spoke Portuguese, they were looking for someone who could work in Brazil, and then they kind of launched\xa0Brazil and let it run, so I didn\'t touch much of it from there, but two years later, they were deciding whether they should expand into Mexico and Argentina, et cetera et cetera, and I travelled down to Mexico, met with a bunch of different people down there to determine if we \xa0should open up an office there. Did a bunch of research on Latin America and then eventually published our expansion strategy. But I think the coolest part of that was that I built a framework\xa0that I heard was still in use, probably not today, but a couple of years back was still in use. It was a framework to use for prioritizing markets for entry. You know to figure out where to go next. And I loved that, that was super fun. I mean it also involved me going to Mexico with these two amazing and hilarious Brazilian men and me. You know, so they were toting me around, so I\'m in the back trying to take notes in these languages that I 50% understand. So that was pretty fun. [Naber] Nice, cool. And can you tell us a little bit about that framework? About the framework you built? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah. So you\'re really testing the limits of my memory, \'cause this is now like six or seven years ago, but I\'m gonna try. So what the framework had, it basically was evaluating in any decision to enter a new international market, I think something that I have seen companies get wrong is basically saying, there\'s a massive potential in this market, and therefore we should go for it. I mean the most classic example obviously is basically Google trying to enter China. Right? It\'s huge, you feel like you gotta be there, but the environment is just. There are really three elements. There\'s like, is it a big market, but is the environment hostile, and then also what is your, what are your consumer metrics like there? You know, when companies think about expanding internationally, the first, and web companies obviously, this is tech and internet companies, but the first thing that you do is you get a domain in that country and you start trying to build up your UGC, your User Generated Content. So for\xa0Facebook,\xa0they want members there, they want people posting. For Google actually I\'m not entirely sure \xa0that they want, what their UGC might be, but they\'re probably trying to launch Google Photos, get people using the platform. For LinkedIn, it was getting members there. For Glassdoor, it\'s getting people to post reviews and salaries et cetera. So building up that UGC pool. And then at that point, you can make a decision on entry. But really if any of those three factors are off, you\'re in trouble. One, market size. Two, hostility. Maybe not hostility as too punitive, but essentially how friendly this environment is, both to business just generally and also to your particular brand of business. And then thirdly, what does your own consumer penetration look like there? What do you have to build on? \xa0 [Naber] Awesome, that\'s great. Thanks so much. \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, oh sure. \xa0 [Naber] So, let\'s jump into NerdWallet. What\'s the one thing they do extremely well? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, so NerdWallet is such an interesting business. I mean that business is\xa0just a crazy cash cow. It is nuts. I\'ve never seen anything like it. I think I\'ve always, the other companies that I\'ve been at have been along the enterprise SaaS model, which I love. I love working in enterprise businesses, I think they\'re really interesting, a lot of people don\'t but I do.\xa0they get a kickback, and it\'s brilliant. And so it\'s really, what I thought was really cool at NerdWallet, they have two superpowers. One, the way you win that market, the way you win the search market, is just having, there are hacky ways to do it that everybody knows. There\'s Ask.com and whatever that Google\'s always trying to kind of take a hit at. But so, let\'s, assuming you don\'t go the hacky way, the real way to do it is you build an incredible content asset. And what NerdWallet has done, which I think is so cool, they have their head of content is this woman named Maggie, and she\'s super impressive. She has an awesome background in journalism. And they have hired a team of badass journalists. Really great writers, really badass people who are experts across different parts of the personal-finance spectrum. And they do two things, one is some writers have managed to marry writing on interesting topics with what that\'s actually going to mean for search results, like how is this going to appear in search results? How is this going to get your page truncation? And then secondly, they now have an investigative reporting arm. Which is so cool. So they\'ve got a team that goes out and digs into personal finance issues, and potentially at their own risk in terms of not really ingratiating themselves\xa0to some of the financial players, they\'ll publish exposes. But they\'ve built is amazing. I mean at least when I left it was, that team was probably almost a hundred people. A lot of them are remote, but really talented, really strong people. So that\'s one amazing thing they\'ve built there. The second thing that again comes from Dan Yoo, who you\'re gonna hear me mention a lot, at biz ops, I\'m sorry, in biz ops at LinkedIn and then of course at NerdWallet.\xa0 To some extent, we got this, by the way, from Jeff Weiner at LinkedIn. And so, just, I\'ve never seen, or not that I\'ve never seen in a sense I\'ve worked for these guys for a long time, but in comparison, they are incredibly data-driven. And data-driven in a way that it flows down through the entire organization. Kind of like I was mentioning with mission and vision at LinkedIn as well, but they\'re data-driven in a way that every single person knows what metric they are driving towards, and what metric they are responsible for. This is really, really hard to do. Building a culture that is that data-driven. Not everyone you hire top-down throughout the organization. Data-driven executive decision making, and then translating that data and those insights and that strategy to the field is something you\'ve had to do at multiple businesses, multiple roles, something you obviously get quite good at. Let\'s take each one of those one at a time. So firstly, can you explain data-driven executive decision making, and how do you think about it, what\'s your mindset, what\'s the method and process you use to go about doing that? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, no it\'s a great question. So that\'s something that we have, we have been working through really actively makes all decisions based on data, And the inherent thing about data is it will always contradict itself. Always. So you can have two metrics that are beautifully defined, the data can be clean and accurate, and I guarantee you, they will at times clash. If they\'re aiming to do the same thing or measure the same thing, they will at times contradict themselves. It\'s just how data works, and especially data in the world that we live today where tech companies collect a ton of data on their users, on their customers, et cetera. And so in the worlds where you\'ve got a leader who wants a ton of data and a ton of metrics, you could often end up where you are both using too many resources to produce data and produce metrics. You\'re just spending too much time on it as a company. Two, you\'re actually confusing executive decision making, it\'s very hard to come to a consensus. And then three, you\'re just kind of at a point where you may truly not know what to do with the business. You need to have data limited enough that there\'s one or two metrics that you use to drive your \xa0decision making, and you don\'t introduce all this confusion. And so I think those are the watch-outs in that first scenario. In the second, take a leader where you have someone who makes decisions based on their gut, you have to really train them to use and trust data. That\'s really hard to do. It\'s really hard to get someone who, and this I think especially happens with leaders who re founders, or leaders have been at the company and built the company for a long time. What you\'ll hear from them is, "I know the data says that, "but I\'ve been here, I\'ve seen how this company was built, "I know how customers buy X company, "how they buy X product." And so that becomes a real uphill battle. And in that instance I think what you need to do is spend a lot of time thinking about what are the few metrics that you know are indicative of the business, \xa0and then even if it\'s not a focus of discussion, just bring it up, every single week, in the management meeting, we\'re gonna look at this metric. And then provide the appropriate level of commentary, so that what\'ll happen is, they\'ll see the business shift, and see the metrics shift\xa0in that direction over time. But that requires a lot of time, and there\'s really no way around just showing that this business went in this direction, remember that this metric was indicating that\xa0about 10 weeks ago, here\'s how you marry them. \xa0 [Naber] Okay, great. So, we talked about data-driven executive decision making. Let\'s say you get to a point where you\'re making a decision, you\'re going in a specific direction. How then do you translate that data, that information, those insights to the field? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah. This is something I think about a lot. And the reason I think is, so I \xa0think I mean it\'s obviously important for the reasons that I talked about earlier with both \xa0LinkedIn and NerdWallet where I thought something that was so amazing was that every single person at those companies knew what metric they were driving and how they were contributing to the business. So it is an incredibly powerful thing to roll data, and specifically, not just data on how to do your job, be data on the core business metrics and how we as a \xa0company are driving to that, down to the field, and down to the lowest levels of the organization. It\'s massively valuable. What you then end up having is, you\'re having a conversation with executives on noticing that a metric is up or down, and you know exactly what to go do to drive that metric in whichever direction you want. So let\'s say one of your metrics is down, and the question becomes, how do we fix it. If let\'s say your sales reps, or your customer success reps, or \xa0whoever\'s responsible for that metric, is not only monitoring, but also responsible for, incentivize on that metric, all you do is say, "Great, we\'re gonna go talk to that team." It becomes like a really beautiful loop. That said, there are a lot of metrics at the executive level that are not really appropriate for the field. And so this is where it gets complicated. At the executive level, for example, the number of calls that a sales rep makes is really important for how good they are at their job. Super basic, super important. Should the CEO be tracking the number of calls that a sales rep makes? Absolutely not. \xa0Should the CEO be tracking the sales rep\'s overall productivity in dollars? Absolutely. That said, you\'re not gonna drive, let\'s say, you\'re not gonna say to sales reps, "Well, the team you\'re on "has been less productive this year, "and we need you to drive that up." They\'re gonna be like, "What do you want me to do about it?" What they need to know is, make more calls, send more e-mails, have more in-person meetings. And so figuring out how to balance the need for at the executive level to have macro metrics, metrics that are large enough, that encompass essentially a broad enough swathe of the business that they\'re meaningful, and having metrics that go to the field that are actionable, something they can specifically drive. And so I think that balance is really important.\xa0And so as awesome as it is when you can find a metric that you can drive all the way through from the CEO all the way down to the field, that\'s amazing, sometimes you need modifications\xa0and tweaks in order to do that. \xa0 [Naber] So when you\'re doing that \xa0for different types of teams, like marketing, sales, customer success specifically, in the commercial stack, do you have to approach that translation and that rolling out in different ways based on those types of themes, and if so, what are some of the differences? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yes, definitely. There, I\'m laughing as I say this, because definitely. Those teams, one of the great learnings that I\'ve had of working on the go to market world, is just how differently these teams are driven, even though they work so closely together. So the most core example of that is, what does a salesperson respond to? They respond to more pay, basically, it just comes down to pay. So tell them how to hit their quota, so they can make more money, they\'re on board. Someone in marketing, not only are they not on a quota, and therefore you can\'t just pay them more, but also someone who goes into marketing, that isn\'t, they\'re just a very different person from someone who goes into sales. Especially I think in marketing, customer success, you get a lot of people who just really love working with clients, they love working with customers. They really thrive in the environment where they\'re thinking about, how do we get our message out there, how do we ensure that people understand who we are,\xa0how do we make sure that someone has a quality experience? The thank-you that they get from a customer can be as valuable as an extra $20,000 is to a sales rep. And so these teams work so closely together, but they\'re, not only are there incentives in terms of how they\'re paid so different, but literally their incentives they often share clients, but they are so different. And so for salespeople, again, it just comes down to, think about their incentives structure. Think about their compensation plan. Beyond these very early days of a start-up, you\'re going to be hiring salespeople whose behaviour will be driven by how you pay them. So if you pay them to just go out and get dollars, they\'ll just go out and get dollars. It doesn\'t mean they\'re getting dollars the way you want them to get dollars. “and here\'s what I\'m gonna give you "if you sell this product." The same would go for if you want them to drive certain activity. It might be that for example, some companies have hybrid sales reps, and it is always easier to just go and try and sell more products to a customer that\'s already convinced, that already buys from you, than it is to go make a new sale to someone who has no sense of your company and who you \xa0are. You may need to incentivize reps to go and do that new business motion which takes a lot more time, is a lot harder, than kind of going and fishing in the existing pools. So my biggest lesson of working with sales teams is incentives are everything. Customer success is a whole different animal. Customer success, I mean customer success obviously takes many different \xa0forms and it can mean many different things to different companies, but typically the people \xa0ho take a job We had a product where we had a very strong hypothesis, which I think by the\xa0way was the right one, which is that most employees when you sign up for a healthcare plan\xa0through your employer, you have literally no idea what you\'re choosing. You have no idea if it\'s\xa0the right plan for you, no idea if it\'s the right plan for your family. And so we built a tool that would plug into your healthcare plan options as an employer, and that you would then roll out for employees to use in onboarding so they could select, I go to the doctor this many times a \xa0year, I need these kinds of specialists, I have this many dependents et cetera, and it would spit out the healthcare plan that was the most effective and efficient for you. And it was really cool, I mean I loved working on it. But we ended up folding it. And the big lesson that I took from that is one, healthcare is really, really, really hard. Regulated spaces are really, really, really hard, they\'re also where we\'re going to do the most good for the world, but they are so difficult. And you need to be really dedicated to figuring that out. And then I think secondly, I just learned a \xa0good lesson there on what companies are willing and not willing to pay for. Which is a great lesson for someone who works in the enterprise business and has been working in SaaS-like spaces. Companies, essentially if we were able to say to them, we\'re going to reduce your healthcare costs by rolling out this tool, they\'d be like, "Awesome, we\'re totally on board." But this was just a way to make things easier, and the value prop was just not quite as clear in that way, right. I guess I wouldn\'t say the value prop in the sense that there was value, there was clear value to it, employees loved it. But the specific value to the employer we couldn\'t quantify.\xa0And it becomes so important to quantify. If you can\'t quantify, it\'s basically dead in the water. \xa0 [Naber] Yeah, good one. Okay, Glassdoor, what is something that, what\'s one of Glassdoor\'s superpowers? What\'s something they do extremely well? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, Glassdoor\'s superpower is actually easy, and I should say, I love\xa0Glassdoor. I think it\'s an amazing company, I\'m so happy there. Part of this is because Glassdoor, what Glassdoor does well is they are an excellent employer. And we should be, right, we literally collect data on what it means to be a good workplace. But we truly walk the walk and talk the talk in a way that I haven\'t really seen any company do before. I mean again, of course, this is our product, right, our product is talking about what makes a great workplace, what makes a great manager, how to ensure you\'re fairly paid. But Glassdoor lives those values to a \xa0tee. Glassdoor has an exceptionable executive team, a really exceptionable executive team, who are, they\'re incredibly smart, they\'re incredibly talented and driven, but they care deeply about their employees and their employee\'s experience. Employee happiness surveys, we send Glint surveys twice a year. We have a full 360 review twice a year, there\'s a lot of feedback and a huge focus on how to be a good manager, how to treat your employees well, and then from the HR side, Glassdoor publishes studies of its own data on whether we\'re fairly paid, all the time, across all of the metrics, across genders, across races, et cetera. It is an exceptional and deeply\xa0thoughtful place to work, and we leverage what we learn in the marketplace to be a great employer ourselves. \xa0 [Naber] Wow, that\'s great. I love the proactive transparency behind all of it too. If you need to talk speak categorically about this, go for it, but an example of a really big or cool project that you\'ve worked on, or are working on at Glassdoor? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, something I have thought a lot about is you first, and there are \xa0companies that have inverted this and gone for start-ups first, but often you tend to go for large enterprise-type customers first, they\'ve got budgets, they\'ve got money, you sell a bunch of enterprise customers, you build, sometimes even a custom product, you definitely have a super customized service motion and model that you have for them, and that\'s how you get out and\xa0you get product-market fit, you start to build your base of customers. And then over time, the\xa0enterprise space is finite. There\'s only so many Fortune 100, Fortune 500, Fortune 1,000 \xa0companies out there. And something, and forgive me if I misquote this, but something like 60% of employers in the US have less than 10 employees. So tons of SMBs out there. That goes to goes to say the SMB space is huge, and then so you start to figure out how you can sell into the SMB space. And as you do that, and that is kind of, I am equating that with when a company scales, although of course as I mentioned, some companies will start small and go big. Either way, for your first initial customers, you likely are building a relatively high touch service model.\xa0They\'ve got two or three people who are at their beck and call, they need anything we\'re there, providing super superior service. But over time, and as you scale, you can\'t do that anymore. One, because as your company grows, you just run out of venture money, you just get to a point where profit matters. Uber is Obviously defying all of these truisms, but for most companies eventually, you need to start turning a profit. But secondly, as you start to sell into smaller companies, or you have smaller deal sizes, it doesn\'t make sense to have a dedicated team servicing a really small customer. So what do you do? And that\'s where automation comes in. And I think that this is an interesting space in that a few years ago, automation was kind of super hot. Everyone was buying tons and ton of different products. it\'s been something that\'s been on the table at all the companies I\'ve been at, \'cause all of the companies I\'ve been at have been in hyper-growth. \xa0 [Naber] Okay, I\'ve got one more question for you, and then we\'ll wrap. If someone\'s looking to build out a biz ops and strategy team,\xa0 or biz ops and strategy function, do you have a couple of best practices or a mindset that they just need to nail these one or two or three things that they\'re gonna build out that function and be really successful? \xa0 [Danielle Peretore] Yeah, that\'s a \xa0good question. So I\'d say a couple of things. One, your biz op, the person that you hire to lead your biz ops team, you want them to be a strategic thinker, So you need someone who\'s going to be able to walk into that room and convince a sceptical executive team of the importance and the value of data. So that first hire is really important. And then also as I mentioned, of course, they\'ve gotta be a really strategic thinker. This has gotta someone who sees the whole picture of the company and can play ball with executives and those senior levels. And the reason they need to be a really strong people leader is the kind of people that \xa0you wanna hire on a biz ops team, they\'re gonna be super data-driven, super strategic like their \xa0leader, and they\'re also going to be pretty intense, and going to be people who are, they\'re \xa0really looking to build a career, they wanna know what their next steps are, they\'ve gotten, the \xa0\xa0was never good enough for them, they got the A plus. And so enabling, you want someone who\'s going to enable the people who do both attract really strong talent and then manage them well. And managing people who are really high octane, really high output, sometimes it\'s easy to let them run, but they actually, they need a lot of support. They certainly need a lot of coaching, they\'re going to want a lot of guidance, they\'re people who are going to seek out\xa0their manager for help. So having someone who\'s a really strong people leader is incredibly important. And then I think in terms of who you hire next, something that I\'ve found is really useful is I send a homework assignment. Again, maybe self-evident, but I think this is something that, send, obviously clean-up the data, make sure that the data that you\'re sending out is not proprietary, I don\'t want anybody getting in trouble, so these are not things in that proprietary \xa0data, out a data exercise, someone on my team did, again, scrubbed, can\'t say that enough, scrub that data. And then I ask them to both manipulate the data, but also to put together a \xa0presentation. And I do this actually pretty mu h across all levels. You learn so much from that. \xa0There are so many people that you\'ll say, oh they\'ve got a great background. But what you don\'t know, and I think one of the major flaws of interviewing and hiring in general, is you just really ever know, you\'re just asking questions. You don\'t know how someone would do with the job, to actually do in the job So send them a sample piece of work. See how they handle it. It\'ll tell you 90% of what you need to know. \xa0 [Naber] Hey everybody, thanks so much for listening.

Naber:\xa0 Ryan, awesome to have you on the show. How are you? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 I\'m doing well, Brandon, thank you so much for having me. Naber:\xa0 Good. It is amazing to...I can see you right now, see your lovely hair, and hear your lovely accent, which is always a treat for me. You\'re in Chicago right now, correct? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 I am, yeah. I moved from Australia to the US a few years ago, and it\'s beautiful, sunny and warm outside, so I can\'t complain. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. I\'ve done some solid research on your personal and professional, from all the content you\'ve put out there, and I\'m pretty convinced, based on the moves that you made, that you\'re doing your penance for growing up in beautiful, best in the world to live Sydney and Cronulla, by trying to attempt to live in the coldest, major market cities in the US - in Boston, Chicago. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Haha, yeah...this is true. Naber:\xa0 No slag on those cities because I love both of them. Lived in Chicago for about five years as well. Hey, let\'s jump in. So, I know that you\'ve had such an amazing career and, in the intro everyone\'s heard a lot of your accomplishments as well as a bunch of the companies you\'ve gone through. So, what we\'ll do, I think today is we\'ll jump into some personal stuff first, for maybe a few minutes, and go through what it was growing up as Ryan Bonnici, and then we\'ll hop into some of the professional, and that\'ll be the meat of what we talk about. Sound okay? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sounds amazing. Naber:\xa0 Cool. Trinity Grammar School, growing up in Cronulla, going through all the interesting things you did in your childhood to become the person you are today - which I believe, a perennial overachiever, which I\'ll talk about in a second. But talk about a little bit about, maybe three or four minutes, on what it was like being Ryan Bonnici as a child and growing up. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Good question. Gosh, I think in one word, what it was like growing up as Ryan Bonnici as the child, would be "lonely" a little bit. Yeah, I was an only child. And, my parents wanted to have more kids, but they stay separated when I was young. And then I got back together, and they eventually divorced, but they didn\'t really want to have a second child because they weren\'t sure about what was gonna happen with their relationship. And so, I don\'t know. I remember just growing up and always wanting a brother or sister or someone to play with. And so, I definitely feel like I was a very different person then than who I am now. But I don\'t know, I think that shaped me to be honest, in good ways and in bad ways. So I think, early on and growing up, decided that I was going to put my self worth on my accomplishments, which I wouldn\'t recommend people do necessarily because you will always be unfulfilled because you\'re always trying to get the next best thing, or to make yourself better, or be better. And flash forward 30 years, and through a lot of therapy, I\'ve been able to unfold a lot of that stuff. But, yeah, I don\'t know, that\'s probably the one word that would best describe me - maybe "lonely", and probably not very social. Which is bizarre, because I think across Linkedin, and Instagram, and Twitter, and different social networks, I probably have a few hundred thousand followers, which I share a lot of content with. So, I come across really social, but I\'m secretly just an extroverted introvert. I grew up in Sydney, Australia. I didn\'t really focus all that much on school up until year 11 and 12, which are the two final years of high school, in Australia. And I don\'t know what it was, but something just clicked in my mind, and I was like, I really want to get a really good GPA because I want to be able to get into any University in the world. And so I worked my butt off and I got a 4.0... Naber:\xa0 Wow. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 And then went to university for a year, and I was a bit burned out at university, and then I took a couple of years off from studying to be an international flight attendant, which kind is random. Naber:\xa0 That\'s pretty cool. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Really fun. It helped me save up to buy my first investment property back when I was 19... Naber:\xa0 Wow. Wow. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, and then I can jump into the career stuff, or happy to answer more questions on the growing up, or wherever you want to take it, Brandon. Naber:\xa0 No, that\'s good. That\'s good. Let\'s pause there just for 30 seconds, and then we\'ll hop into some career stuff. But, you mentioned, you mentioned the word "lonely", and you\'ve talked about - in a lot of the content you\'ve put out around mental health, mental health in the workplace, and how it shaped you professionally - can you talk a little bit about that? Because you\'re really passionate about it. And, I think that\'s probably a good place to start because you talked about how some of the events in your childhood had shaped you up until who you are today. Can you just give us a little bit more about that, and how it shaped you as to who you are right now? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, sure. So I think mental health is just something that, I think it impacts everyone to some degree. Some people have good mental health, somebody will have poor mental health. And I think everyone will experience poor a mental health, at certain times of their lives. I think for me, and my family anyways, there\'s definitely a genetic component because my mum, my mum\'s mum, there\'s quite a significant amount of depression and suicidality in our family. So I think some of my own experiences growing up, as well as some of just my genetics, I think predisposes me to have more issues in that space. Which I think I used to view as a problem, but now I just view it actually as something that needs to be trained in the same way that I train my body by going to the gym, I train my mind by going to therapy and doing different therapeutic modalities. And so, I think growing up as an only child and experiencing bullying when I was in primary school, just sort of...I think you attachment to your friends, your attachment to your family, your attachment to these key figures in your early years is really paramount in your formation of the world, and relationships, and whether or not you, when you interact with someone, whether you are going to over-index for them being trustworthy, or you\'re going to over index for them being someone who\'s going to take advantage of you, or whatnot. So I think for very good half of my career, I was definitely the latter. So I, unconsciously anyways, viewed everyone around me as a potential bully. And so that meant that I was super competitive and was always thinking about how people around me were going to, I don\'t know, get in my way, or take me down, or stabbing in the back, which sounds really dramatic. And it wasn\'t like I was going through my jobs and literally thinking that, and like planning behind the scenes. But I think what I\'ve learned for therapy now, is that I think, and in some ways, I think I\'ve grown a lot of empathy actually toward those parts of me that felt that way, and still sometimes do feel that way, because they were defensive and they were protective, right? They protected me when I was young by not trusting peopl..kids, when I was younger. It protected me from enduring more bullying. But once I was no longer at school, and in university, and at work where that doesn\'t really ever happen all that much, still sometimes happens, but not all that much, it\'s definitely less helpful of a strategy. So I think that shaped me in some ways and meant that I focus more on, I\'ll talk about it a bit later, but I think in career success you really need to focus on relationships and results, the two R\'s. And I think, it probably meant for me the earlier on in my career, I over-indexed on results. And I think now I do a better job at,equally indexing between results and relationships. Naber:\xa0 Wow. That\'s great. That\'s a really good framework for people to think about. Thank you. And then I really appreciate you sharing all of that as well. We\'re lucky enough to know each other personally and professionally, which is really cool. So, I wish we had three hours, four hours, 10 hours to talk about this stuff right now. So that\'s actually a really good segue. You mentioned getting into university and then getting into your first few gigs and over indexing on results. Can you walk us through some of your, just walking through your professional jumps in the roles that you\'ve had? Maybe in three or four minutes, and then I\'ll hop into a couple of questions about some of the superpowers I know that you have, and some of the things you\'ve written about as well, so we can get a little bit more of your mindset. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sure. Yeah. So, I basically started, my career in tech started at Microsoft, into Microsoft for their, I forget what it was called, but it was basically their accelerator program, their leadership program. Microsoft either hires people that are fresh out of university that they identify as folks with leadership potential, and they fast track them to management, or they hire people with 10 plus years of experience. Microsoft almost exclusively never hired anyone with from one to nine years. So I entered through that leadership track, and that was my first exposure to Marketing. I always knew I wanted it to be a CMO. And weirdly, I always knew I wanted to be a CMO before 30. So yeah, I started my career at Microsoft. And then, after spending some time there and learning a lot about B2C Marketing, a company called ExactTarget, which was based out of Indianapolis, in the US, was growing internationally. And Microsoft was a really big user of ExactTarget\'s email Marketing platform, of which I was a user. And so when they launched Asia Pacific, they hired me as their first Partnerships Marketer. So I then joined ExactTarget, and spent a few years at ExactTarget. And there I really was able to move up, in both experience and in leadership. And so, I built out a big team there across Asia Pacific while I was at ExactTarget. And then ExactTarget was acquired by Salesforce. So I was able to then spend a few years at Salesforce running their Marketing for Asia Pacific. Again, a really remarkable super innovative company, but quite a bit smaller than...a little bit bigger than ExactTarget, but quite a bit smaller, the Microsoft. So I was running all of their B2B Marketing. And so, at ExactTarget, I suppose I was able to really refine, I would say my enterprise B2B Marketing playbooks. So how do you work with Sales to create net-new Sales opportunities for Sales, as well as nurture and accelerate existing Sales opportunities to move them through Sales process faster. So it\'s very high touch, low volume game, the enterprise B2B playbook. And I had done that for quite a few years and really enjoyed it, but I felt I had really pushed it to its extreme. And, at that time, I was really interested in the company called HubSpot because I was fascinated by how they were doing Marketing, and I love their product. And so I then moved to HubSpot, and was the first Marketing hire in APAC, and then built out their APAC Marketing Team across Sydney, Singapore, Japan. And what I loved about HubSpot, and what was really important to me in my journey, was that HubSpot was still B2B Marketing, but it was B2B at scale, right? So we were selling our software platform, which was an all in one Marketing and Sales platform to small and medium businesses. I think the average sale was about a thousand dollars per month, for HubSpot. And so when you\'re selling a product that, it\'s less about high touch and more about, high volume. And so that was really important to me because, eventually I still do want to start my own company. And while I love the enterprise playbook that I used at ExactTarget and Salesforce, when you\'re throwing big events and doing a lot of that high touch, high hand holding activities, it\'s really expensive, right? We\'re talking millions of dollars. Whereas at HubSpot, we had much tighter budgets because we were much more focused on ROI-focused Marketing, and the biggest driver and the most effective driver for ROI-focused Marketing and B2B, and in B2C actually in a lot of senses, is content Marketing. It takes a little bit more time than some of the other strategies, but once you build up traffic from content, the leads, and the MQL\'s, and the revenue just keeps flowing. So I love...probably prior to G2, my time at HubSpot, those three years, the most proud, time of my life. It was also really challenging, but I learned so much in that first year, about how to do scalable Marketing. So I\'m so grateful to have worked there, and just genuinely love the team there so much. I then moved over from Sydney to the US with HubSpot to run their Global Marketing in the sense of digital, social, brand campaigns, PR - and that was fun because it exposed me to another part of Marketing that I didn\'t have as much exposure to in APAC. And then about, gosh, a little under two years ago, then moved to G2. And the reason why I wanted to move to G2 is that I love B2B, but I think eventually I realistically want to get back to B2C or a B2B / B2C role. And what I love about G2 and a lot of the most innovative businesses today - like Uber, Airbnb, they\'re all marketplaces... Naber:\xa0 Marketplaces, yeah. Two-side or three-sided marketplaces. It\'s amazing. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. And they\'re really fascinating, and super complex and difficult. But I wanted that challenge. I think, if you look at my roles from moving in B2C at Microsoft, to Enterprise B2B, to SMB B2B, I don\'t like it when I\'m comfortable, because I don\'t feel I\'m learning. And I find it takes me a year to basically, without sounding an arrogant douche bag, it takes me a year to become an expert at something. So, my first year at G2 I was hopeless maybe. First year at HubSpot, I wasn\'t hopeless, but I didn\'t feel I could add as much value necessarily as the other marketers on the team had been there longer. And I find, typically it takes me six to 12 months to learn everything from that industry and that company and the existing people on the team. And then at the six to 12 month point, I\'m able to have a bit more of an integrative understanding of what we should do next because of all of the experiences that I\'ve had. And so, yeah, I always find that when I do my best work is from years one to three, the end of years one to three. Yeah. Naber:\xa0 Very cool. That\'s actually amazing to know about yourself. You know, wot many people really have that self reflection, understanding of where their best work comes from, how long it takes them to be good at something, what the expectation of themselves, and how to manage that. That\'s, that\'s great. I\'ve always been so impressed, impressed by your career, for a lot of reasons. You\'ve accomplished more in a shorter space of time than most, and at really high velocity. But a lot of people that do that, they usually go usually a "T". As in they usually have a lot they have very thin breadth across a lot of things, but a lot of depth in one thing. You have depth and so many things across a Sales and Marketing spectrum because of you\'re unique set of circumstances, that you both put yourself in, and that you were put in a for the roles and responsibilities that you\'ve had. All the way across, operations, digital, and Sales, and Sales Development. You actually, mentioned that, your job is part marketer and part Sales person and one of your articles. And I think that that\'s just a true testament to your background, your experiences, to have that mindset. But one of the things I want to talk about right now, you just mentioned, all the amazing businesses you\'d worked with. I want to talk about talent. And how you think about attracting, pipelining, hiring, retaining great employees. So you and I both subscribe to the same mindset, I believe, from the content that you\'ve put out there and from having conversations, that talent and hiring is the number one priority for every business. And should be for every single hiring manager as the CEO of that hiring process. So always be pipelining, even and especially when you\'re not hiring so you can get rockstars on your team, regardless of having readily available headcount or budget, regardless of of having those things open. So let\'s break those things down. attract pipeline, hire and retain. You talk about in some of your content, I think it was in an Entrepreneur.com article, you talk about not just thinking about Sales and Marketing from an inbound perspective, but thinking about recruiting, hiring and attracting talent from an inbound perspective. Can you talk a little bit about that mindset, and how you apply that to the way that you hire talent? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sure, sure. Yeah. So, I think the reality is, and the way I think about recruiting is, most people that are actively looking for a job are actively looking because they\'re probably not good at their job, and that\'s the reality. And people that are good at their job, they don\'t look for jobs. They are constantly...they\'re working hard, they\'re doing a great job for the company that they\'re at, and it\'s businesses that intrigue them that they might want to speak to. So, I\'m at a loss for words for the exact word that I described this. I did a talk on this once at a big HR conference in Singapore. But you\'ve got people that are actively in the process, and then you\'ve got your inactive folks. And you\'re active folks make up something like 10% of the pool, and inactive or dormant candidates, which again, that\'s not the right word for it, make up 90% of... Naber:\xa0 Passive candidates. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, your passive candidates are making up...they\'re the best candidates, but they\'re not the ones coming to job boards and looking for you. And so you really need to be focused on how do you attract them. And so I\'m a really big believer in that, for really key talent. you need to be proactively meeting, and building relationships, and learning about people and what they\'re doing and working on. And so I probably do job interviews...I interview about, I don\'t know, maybe five to 10 people a week. Sometimes for roles and I don\'t even have open. And when I say interview, that\'s a very loose term. It\'s more so, 50% of those might be official interviews, 50% of them are literally just coffee catch ups - where I\'ve sent a note to let\'s say, the Head of PR at a big marketplace that I won\'t say because I have spoken to someone recently in that space, and I\'m like "Hey, I absolutely love the PR that you\'re doing at your company. I read a few of these stories, and they\'re fascinating. Would love to just sync up marketer to marketer and see if we could learn from each other and just chat" And I genuinely actually do, I just want to get to know these people and learn about them. And all of the best hires I\'ve ever made have been passive candidates, because it\'s based off of their work, not them being actively in the cycle. So whenever I see a great company running a great campaign, I\'ll look at, okay, who runs campaigns at that company, and I\'ll then stalk them on Linkedin, Twitter, Instagram, and slide into their DM\'s, and work out a way to meet with them because I\'m genuinely interested in their craft. And it\'s not a Sales pitch because I am genuinely interested, and they can see that and they get it. And that\'s how I open up. That\'s how I like to fill funnel right now. That\'s not to say I don\'t work with a recruiter. I have a recruiting of here at G2 that\'s constantly hiring roles for me. But most of my director and above level roles, I rarely, rarely hire...not because I choose to, but I find that most people that I will hire at director or VP level will be folks that I have found myself. Because I think that if you\'re a passive candidate...and I get emails all the time from recruiters and I\'m passive in that I\'m looking for a new job, but I rarely respond to them. But if a CMO or CEO at another company that I was really interested in, reached out and said, "Hey, love what you\'ve been doing at G2, and how you completely changed the brand, and how you\'ve grown traffic, and I listened to on a podcast - would love to catch up." That\'s something that I\'m like, yeah, YOLO. I want to meet other smart folks, and I like to hear that the things that I\'m doing are getting noticed, selfishly. And so that sort of thing - that works. And so that\'s how I think about recruiting. I\'m pretty process oriented. When I\'m going off after a candidate - a passive candidate - I\'m a little less process driven because it\'s very much that I am just looking for great people out there. When I\'m in Director-level or below interview, when someone\'s in our active recruiting cycle, and whether or not we\'ve found them or they found us, I use a bit of a case-based method for how I interview. So I basically start off the interview, where I want to learn a bit more about them. But then I asked them a pretty simple question of, "What were you brought into your company to impact?" And so this has helped me really quickly understand, if they give me a really long answer or they can\'t answer that, it just shows me that they don\'t really know why, what their role is at the company. So I\'ll ask them that to understand. So if someone asked me that at G2, I\'d say "Well, I was brought into G2 to drive more Sales revenue, increase our brand, and drive more traffic. And then I\'ll follow it with a specific task. So I asked them, "Can you please describe the task, or the challenge, or the project, or the problem that you were brought in to solve?" So they might say, "Well, I was brought in to to increase our MQL to SQL conversion", right? Or Blah, blah, blah. And then I will ask them, okay - after whatever they say - then I\'ill ask them, "How did you measure your success on that thing?" And then they might say, and this is the worst response ever, they might say, "I wish I could measure it, but my company doesn\'t really care to measure those things." And then I would dig in further, "Oh, okay, that\'s okay. Let\'s say your company did measure those things, how would you want them to be measured?" And that way, I can work out is their brain thinking about measurement in the right way? And then after I understand the measurability component, I then go into action. So, "What projects or tasks did you specifically work on to reach success?" And what that helps me understand is - did they actually do the job? Because companies have lots of successes. We as a Marketing team have done a ton of success, and we talk about it as a team. So it would be easy for someone to take ownership, or pretend that they drove the success of the team, or something else. So this "actions" thing is important to me because it helps me understand, from start to finish, what was their involvement? Did they partner with someone? Where did the idea come from? Did they hit roadblocks? That\'s really key. And then I\'ll ask them, "What results we\'re actually achieved?" And then I\'ll go into timeframes, "So, how long did it take to get here?" and scale around what would they maybe do differently, or would they do it again or not? And so, that\'s just really quickly, at a high level, the case flow that I like to go through when I\'m interviewing a candidate that has a core set of skills that I\'m trying to get deep into and understand how they think. Separate to that though, I think, for me, I really care about people that are data-driven, growth focused - so they have experience in growing things. And the data stuff, the growth stuff, that will come through in this case method that I use. I want people that are lifelong learners, that are obsessed with...if you do want to work on my team and you aren\'t on social media, and you aren\'t obsessed with how ads work, and how tracking works, and how digital works - this isn\'t the right team for you. So I can tell from a lot of their online presences already, whether or not they\'re probably going to be right for me. And yeah, that\'s high level how I think about the actual nitty gritty process of it. And then when it comes to retention and growing employees, I have a pretty direct approach where I connect with most people on the team every other month. I connect with, obviously, all my direct reports every week. But I try and encourage them to really understand that transparency is the most important thing to me. And I try and mirror that to them. And by being really transparent with them and sharing with them, what I am working on, what I\'m finding challenging, why I can\'t do what someone has asked me to do, and giving them the logic. And I think today with employees, that they crave to understand "why?" you as a leader make the decisions you make. And, I think, for a long time, leadership decision were made behind closed doors, and people were just told what to do. And I think Gen-Y\'s, and most employees now in today\'s workforce, want to be involved, and want to be able to share their opinion, and I\'m really encouraging of that. But I also explain that this isn\'t a democracy. And I want everyone to share their opinion, so that I can make the best decision. And I might make a decision that is different to what you want, but that doesn\'t mean that I won\'t listen to you and respect your opinion. But I have to make a decision at the end of the day, and I might have a broader perspective than you because I\'m getting all of your input, and then I have all the inputs from my job, and being on a leadership team, that you might not have. So yeah, that\'s really quickly, I guess how I think about, recruiting, interviewing, and then developing and retaining employees. Naber:\xa0 That was great. You did my job for me - all the way down to the method, and the process you use, some of the questions you ask, the examples you gave. I really what you said around the vulnerability and transparency of communication...openness of the communication within your team. You write about that and some of the things you read about making sure people can share. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 I really think...I can always keep doing a better job, this is something that I need to work on - partly, it\'s something that I have needed to really focus on consciously, because it\'s so different than my style a few years ago. And I think that\'s partly through a lot of therapy, and a lot of my own work, I realized that some of those defenses that I used to have as a child that were helpful then, weren\'t helpful as an adult, as a leader in business. And so I\'ve had to develop there further. But I think that...this is a bit of a, not a sad story, but I had a colleague yesterday who I love that they\'re on my team, they\'re amazing, who we were meeting for a one on one, and they texted me and they said...let\'s see if I have the message (*searches phone with Ryan Bonnici style, focus, grace, and precision)...it was basically, long story short, "Hey Ryan, I\'m really sorry. I\'m not going to be able to make our one on one right now. I think I\'m having a panic attack, and I might head home." And naturally I was, "Please, do what you need to do for it, and take care of yourself." And I don\'t think an employee would have sent that to me previously. They might\'ve said, "I\'m out sick" or something. But I have said to my own employees in the past, over slack, when I was having an anxiety attack at some point, I just canceled all my meetings that day and took a mental health day, pretty publicly. And I was like, "I\'m out today guys, I\'m taking a mental health day." And I was in the office, and I had to go home because I just wasn\'t feeling it. And the amount of people that texted me after for that to say that they appreciated me being so public with that helped them feel they could bring their whole selves to work. And if they are feeling similarly, they don\'t need to lie about how they feel. They can just be open. And not to say that they have to, but I think again, it\'s all about sort of living it yourself, and showing others that they can do the same thing. Naber:\xa0 Totally. Setting the standard, demonstrating the standard, so you can hold the standard. I talked to someone about that, about culture the other day and I believe it\'s the exact same thing with mental health in the workplace and openness of communication. That\'s a really good example. Thanks for sharing that. And you keep that openness, from a retention perspective, I think the openness that you keep with the way that you talk to your employees and the way that you talk to your teams - it sounds from the way that you\'re writing and the example here, I read an article that you\'d written the other day, sorry I read the other day that you\'d written, talking about encouraging your best employees to consider outside job offers, and having that very open dialogue and open discussion. Can you talk a little bit about that mindset and what that means to you? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, sure. So I think part of it is that too many leaders and people in business tip toe around the idea that people are going to work for a company forever, right? And I think the reality is that the average lifespan of a marketer at a company is, gosh, two years maybe. And so yeah, if you look at my track record, it\'s three years on average. Naber:\xa0 I read the other day, it was something like - those coming out of college right now are poised to have something like 13.2 employers throughout their life. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, that makes sense. And, I\'m really open with people because if you look at my track record, I\'ve done the same. And so what I really want to encourage people to do, is if reaches out to you for a job offer because they think you\'re a good fit for a role, you should respond. I mean assuming you want, you don\'t have to, but you should...and I do this, I would always respond to them. So recruiters hit me up all the time, and they be like, "Hey Ryan, I have a CMO role or CEO role at this super sexy high growth company, blah, blah, blah." My first message back, I have no niceties, I\'m like, "Thanks for your message. What is the company?" Because that\'s all I care about, right? Who is the company that we\'re talking about? Because there\'s heaps of roles out there, but I don\'t want to work for just anyone or for everyone. And so once they tell me that the company is, then if it\'s an interesting company, I might chat to them or their leadership team to learn a bit more. And I think why that\'s important is because it helps me solidify to myself if I am in the right role myself. By chatting someone else and seeing what other roles are available and by asking questions I can work out, "Oh gosh no, in my role today, I\'m so much happier." But it also helps me have a baseline understanding of - what roles are out there? What are the typical skillsets that are needed,? How much are people paying for my skillset? Which helps give me visibility into, do I need to be asking for more money at my current company, or am I paid fairly. And so I think if you treat your employees really, really well, and be open and honest with them in that, they\'re not probably gonna work for you forever, and that you want the best for them in their career, because you understand that they\'ll then be an advocate for you and your company afterwards, then they\'re a little bit more open about these things. And so, and yeah, I just do that with my team, and I practice what I preach. And so it means that that encourages folks to feel open about that they can come to us and say, "Hey, I have this job offer from this company. I don\'t necessarily want to leave, but they\'re offering double what you guys are offering me." And if this is an employee that\'s amazing that we couldn\'t do without, then we\'ll try and do whatever we can to keep them. And that might mean more responsibilities, if they\'ve shown that they deserve it. It might mean more pay. It depends on why the person\'s making the decision, right? And that\'s case by case, but I think you can get a better understanding of that, and help them see as well, by asking them questions about the role and the company...I often times find that I will uncover things that they don\'t know, or haven\'t realized. Like, they haven\'t asked how much budget they might, or who their boss is going to be, or if they were told that they could run a team - but is it going to be in writing that they will get to run the team? And just these things that they haven\'t asked. And they start to then realize, holy shit, I have so much more potential and bandwidth here on Ryan\'s team. Yes, the grass might seem greener on the other side because they\'re offering more money, but there\'s a reason why they\'re offering more money. It\'s because they can\'t get good talent. So, I don\'t know, and by doing that they may realize that, yes, they should leave, or not. And so, I think I preface always these conversations with my team with a bit of an asterisk, in the sense of that you might go through that process and come to us and say that there is this offer that you\'re going to take, and we might say to you, if we don\'t feel you are contributing well on the team or you\'re not someone that we want to change the situation for, you should take the role. Naber:\xa0 Take it. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. No, exactly. Naber:\xa0 That\'s the best case scenario for everybody too, it\'s great. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, exactly right. Yeah. You should take that role because we think that you are paid fairly, and as per your last performance review, we\'ve made it pretty clear to you in terms of what you would need to do to get to the next level, and you haven\'t done that yet. So, we\'re happy for you to stay here and keep developing you, but if it\'s money that you want, you\'re not going to get that here until you put in the work that we\'ve shown you. And I think just from having that dialogue, they can better understand how much more quality coaching and development they are going to get with you than another company. And they can then make their own decision. So that\'s how I try and think about it. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Thanks. Thanks so much for the multiple, multiple layers you went into with that. And you\'ve been, you\'ve been at so many businesses where you\'ve had just amazing people at those businesses, built awesome cultures. I think one of the things that people want to hear about is, how you think about talent. We just talked about that. And then also, a couple things around the science of what you\'ve done. So building Inbound Marketing Engines, you\'ve been at the Mecca of Inbound at HubSpot. And I couldn\'t even count on two hands how many amazing people I know at HubSpot, and how many reasons I love the culture there, as well as love the products. And so even people outside the business feel that way. But, tell us what you learned at HubSpot about building Inbound Marketing Engines that translates to G2 and how you\'ve built that engine right now, as well as every subsequent Marketing engine you\'re going to build. What translates that everyone should be doing as they\'re building their Inbound engine. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Gosh, okay. So, I mean, as you mentioned, working for HubSpot has taught me everything that I know about Inbound. And that was actually, when I mentioned before why I was so grateful for work there, was I just was able to work with the smartest Marketing minds, and I just fucking love that team, and miss them so much. They\'re a big customer at G2 actually, and I got the chance to head back to Boston last month because we recorded this amazing customer success video with their CEO, Brian Halligan and Kip Bodnar, their CMO. And they were talking about all the value that they get from G2, and why they couldn\'t connect with their customers if it wasn\'t for G2. And so it was so fun to get to go back there and profile this company that I was so proud to have worked at, and that was a big customer of ours. It was really quite nice. Look, what I think what I learned there is that...HubSpot literally wrote the book on Inbound Marketing. And so, I think what I learned about was just how to take a really data driven approach to drive, to creating content that drives results. And I think, blogging and writing, Content Marketing is something that can be done really...most people do it horribly wrong. Because everyone can write, so everyone thinks they can be a blogger or a content marketer. And anyone can actually write good content, if they have the right training or if they use the right assistance tools. The problem where I think most people go wrong with content Marketing is once you\'ve decided what you\'re writing about, if it\'s not the right topic, you can\'t optimize it for something whereby no one searches for that topic. So, optimization, SEO optimization when it comes to content Marketing, happens before topics are even selected, before pen touches the paper. And that\'s why my VP, Content & SEO is an SEO by trade. He ran SEO at Atlassian, and now leads SEO and Content for us G2. And the reason being is, you need to look at...you to just start with keyword research and work out, okay, where are people searching? And which searches indicate that this person is our persona that we are trying to attract to our website, blog, etc? And then you need to work out, okay, how high quality are the keywords in relation to the persona - like, is 50% of the traffic that we\'re going to get for this keyword with a million searches going to be our buyer persona, and if so, that means 500,000 of the 1 million is going to be out traffic. Or, alternatively, there could be a 700,000 terms per monthly searches that has a 90% percent alignment to your buyer persona, which is going to be higher than that 500,000. But if you just chose the biggest number, you might not get as much of the right people. And so we take a super data driven approach. And we, we literally published, just yesterday, I had the team publish a playbook. And it\'s a five part playbook - on learn.g2.com (https://learn.g2.com/hub/1-million/how-we-grew), which is our learning hub - which was literally the entire play by play that we created to create a blog at G2 just last year, around seven months ago, that went from zero visitors to over a million monthly visitors within seven months or something like that. Insane growth, right? This blog now makes up...this blog is driving millions and millions of visitors, and it hasn\'t existed - per month, I should add - and it hasn\'t existed for more than a year now. You know, HubSpot\'s blog drives about 6 million monthly visitors, but HubSpot been working on that bad boy for about 10 years. Naber:\xa0 Wow. That\'s a great proportional perspective for how fast your blog has grown. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. We are on track to hit 4 million monthly by the end of this year - that\'s goal that I set the team for the blog alone. Our total website, we\'ll be at about 10 million monthly by the end of this year. And when I joined G2 our traffic was around, it was less than a million a month. So, in two years to go from less than a million monthly visitors to 10 million, which is where we\'re on track for, that\'s fucking insanity. Naber:\xa0 That\'s literally 10x. That\'s insane. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 And that\'s not just my work, it\'s not just the Marketing team\'s work. We have a great product team that we work with, we have lots of contributing content writers that create content...But majority that traffic\'s all organic as well, I should have said. We don\'t do any paid content. And so, yeah, that\'s one thing that I\'m really frickin\' proud about. Because, I mentioned earlier, relationships and results. Relationships are super important, but results are as well. I think, you said I was able to fast track my career. And, I was, I got the Cmo role at G2 when I was 29, and I couldn\'t have done that if it wasn\'t for really overindexing on results. And what I mean there, is if you tell me to hit a million monthly visitors, I\'ll hit four (million). And it\'s not because I\'m trying to show off or anything, it\'s basically because I derive a lot of self worth through my work achievement. And, over time I\'m getting better at disconnecting and finding self worth from who I am as a person, regardless of job, but that\'s still something that\'s really important to me. And so, I\'m thankful for that part...that lonely boy role that I played when I was younger because it helped get me here, and I don\'t think I would change it looking back. Naber:\xa0 Wow, that\'s an excellent answer. I love it. I hope everyone...I don\'t think people could write down notes fast enough as they\'re listening to that. So can we dive in one more layer on that? So two things. One, what are the phases you go through as you\'re thinking about building a strategy - for one year, two years? If I\'m listening to this as a Head of Marketing or Head of Sales & Marketing, and I\'m thinking about - what are the phases I\'m going to go through? You\'ve directed this movie multiple, multiple times. So what are the phases you go through as you\'re building a strategy. And then two, what does your scorecard look like do that you know how to measure it? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 So, I guess, it can be a bit different depending on if you\'ve been doing content Marketing for awhile, or if you\'re just starting out, it\'s slightly different. If you\'ve been doing it for awhile - and I wrote a big blog post Entrepreneur magazine called The One Marketing Metric That You\'re Not Measuring, which outlines this process in more detail. If anyone Google\'s The One Marketing Metric That You\'re Not Measuring and my name, they\'ll find it. But basically, if you\'ve already been creating content for a while, step one would be explore all your Google analytics data, map it and connected to your CRM data, and worked out which blog posts are driving the most organic traffic, and what\'s the conversion rate of that traffic into leads, and leads into MQL\'s, and MQL\'s into revenue. And then you can start to connect, what content topics that I\'m writing about? If I think of HubSpot, one content topic they might write about is Marketing automation, and another content topic they might write about is social media, another contents topic they might write about is Marketing budgets - because, all of those things are things that a Marketer would be searching for, and they sell to a Marketer. And so, you would then group all of your content in pages around those topics, and see, okay, in the aggregate how much traffic has the social media content driven to our blog organically, how much of those organic visitors to social media content have been converted into leads, etc. And you can start to work out what content topics are driving the most revenue at the bottom of the funnel. Yeah. Does that kind of make sense? Connecting the two? Naber:\xa0 Yep. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 And then, so that would be what I would recommend you do if you\'ve already got a lot of content, you are driving organic traffic, and you want to get a bit of an understanding of what is and isn\'t working. If you\'re just starting out fresh - and then once you\'ve done that, you then can still do what I\'m going to suggest now - but if you are starting out fresh, then what I would suggest is just, you know, your buyer persona better than anyone. Think about, sit down, and think about what does this person do in their day to day life. And I if use the HubSpot example again, the Marketing persona that we were trying to attract, I don\'t just think of about their job in the context of my software. So what I mean by that is, yes, HubSpot\'s platform does email Marketing and social media. So those were two of the topics that I touched on before. HubSpot product does nothing around budgeting, but we still created content around that topic because that was something that a Marketer needs help with. They create budgets - they go to Google, and they search for budget templates. So it\'s not just about creating contents that are close to your product, it\'s about creating content around topics that your buyer persona would be searching for regardless of whether or not they are looking for your product at that moment in time. Okay? And that\'s a really important piece because if you just create content topics around the things that are in relation to your product or service, they\'re way more competitive typically than other topics because that\'s, that\'s the simple "dumb" Marketer to thing to do. Sorry, that\'s a bit mean. I shouldn\'t say the "dumb" Marketer thing to do. That\'s just the thing that everyone does naturally. You don\'t have to be very creative to think about doing that. And so, and I\'m not saying that you shouldn\'t do that, but you should be thinking broader as well. I feel bad now the saying "dumb" Marketer. Naber:\xa0 Ha, I think people will forgive you based on all the valued you\'re delivering, so don\'t worry about it. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 And so, once you start to look into those different topics, that\'s when you start to do keyword research and using tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs. But, ideally come to G2, and search for the best SEO software, and we\'ll give you personalized recommendations. And then you can start to look at some content tools that are out there, and group these different topics to see what kind of volume of people are searching for the topics? How difficult is it to rank for these topics? So most of the different platforms will give a difficulty score of one to a hundred. A hundred - meaning it\'s impossible, you are never going to rank for this unless you are facebook.com. To one - any person that launches a new website can rank for it. And so you want to choose a mixture of difficult terms because they typically have higher volume, and a mixture of some easier terms because they typically have a lower volume. And the easier terms are good because they start to drive immediate traffic to your site because you can rank for them quickly. But also, once you start driving organic traffic, then you start to create the flywheel effect whereby, okay, all these new people that are reading your content are going to enter your subscription process. And then they\'ll be return visitors for email Marketing. As well as, they\'re probably creating, if they\'re marketers and that\'s who you\'re attracting, they probably have their own blogs. If they really liked what you wrote about, they might link to you. And then if they link to you, that helps you increase your domain authority, which then helps you rank for more difficult terms. So you want to be doing both. And I think that\'s a mistake that we made early on at G2, where...and it was my fault, I joined from HubSpot, and we had a domain authority of 92 out of a hundred at HubSpot. And so when I joined G2, I think we had a domain authority only around 80. So some of the terms that I wanted the team to go after very early on were just too difficult. And so we didn\'t drive any traffic to them until six months later. And the team was smart enough to say, "Hey, while we\'ve created some of these really difficult, high volume content, we need to do some easier content that\'s going to be a quicker win in the meantime to get the flywheel going, to get Google noticing our site. I know I explained that really quickly to a certain extent, but I know we have limited time. And there\'s...I could talk about this literally for 24 hours. There\'s so many details to this, and it seriously...if anyone wants this step for step, they should just go to learn.g2.com (https://learn.g2.com/hub/1-million/how-we-grew) because we published the playbook for this yesterday. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Do you remember, for the audience, do you remember what the title was? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think the title of it is literally, how we grew our organic traffic to 1 million monthly visitors. (https://learn.g2.com/hub/1-million/how-we-grew) Naber:\xa0 Okay, sweet. Very original title - that\'s good. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Haha, yeah, very original. Naber:\xa0 For everyone listening, I\'ll put the link to in the description of this, of this episode. (https://learn.g2.com/hub/1-million/how-we-grew) Hey, last thing I want to talk about because I know we do have limited time, is one more superpower that I think is really clear to everyone - that both follows you on social, understands how your career trajectory has gone, as well as the businesses that you\'ve helped build - is around brand building. You just went to Cannes Lions, and you wrote a Linkedin article about it being a big chance for B2B marketers to learn from top B2C Marketing strategies. And you talked about B2B brand building a little bit in that. You also have on social media, your following...you mentioned it a little bit earlier, but I couldn\'t believe the numbers that it was looking at. I mean, I could, but I couldn\'t at the same time. And you have 21,000 fans on Facebook, 56,000 followers on Instagram, 20,000 followers on Twitter, 32,000 followers on LinkedIn. Every single one of those platforms is extremely challenging to get even close to a fraction of that, let alone have that consistency. So could you talk a little bit about, building brand from a,B2B perspective, and then also from a social perspective where you can marry those two things together, however you think about it. But I think a lot of people are going to struggle with building their B2B brand because you mentioned, B2B is so far behind B2C and being able to do that. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. Yeah. So, I think B2B Marketers are traditionally the worst at building brands. And it\'s because, B2B typically, when you\'re selling to businesses, you\'re typically selling a higher value product. It\'s very logical, rational. You\'re solving a very specific problem. Which means that because it\'s so Sales driven, and because Sales focuses time on those pain points with prospects, Marketing just seems to always be quite clinical and boring and corporate. So the reason why I went to Cannes was because, I think the B2C world do a much better job when it comes to...When it comes to CPG, consumer package goods, and fast moving products, it\'s far less logical and rational, and it\'s far more emotional, and gut, and instinctual. And so their content and campaigns are always very visceral. They\'re very much about making you feel a certain way. They\'re about surprising you, delighting you, making you laugh, making you cry. And I don\'t necessarily think that, B2B should go completely down that path. But I think as a CMO it would be silly of me not to, it would be dumb of me. Here we go, I\'ll pay myself out and make up for my last comment. It would be dumb of me not to go to that event, at least once, because there\'s stuff that I can learn from that industry. And I think that\'s actually, funnily now that we talk about it, a very good proof of what I said before, that I am obsessed with learning from other people in other industries, selfishly because I want to steal all of their great ideas and apply them to my world, and integrate them better than anyone else. And I think I genuinely do a pretty good job at understanding many aspects of Marketing, more than I think other CMO\'s that have just stayed in one lane. And it\'s because I just push myself out of my comfort zone. So, yeah, I don\'t think B2B CMO\'s do a very good job at that. And I don\'t think we have done a very good job at G2. And so, I want to upskill myself so that I can help upskill my team, etc. I think, if you look at software today, right? There is something like 60,000 pieces of B2B software out there. There\'s probably, there\'s something like 250, maybe a thousand different email Marketing platforms. And so in the B2B space, B2B used to be a differentiator...so B2B software - SaaS - used to be, I think a thing that could differentiate you in terms of winning or losing. If you\'re a company that got in on SaaS and software early, that gave you an unfair advantage. And I think today everyone uses software. Everyone uses 50 different pieces of just email Marketing software alone. The software is less the differentiator today, and it\'s how you use the software. And so, once you move into a parody market where you\'re selling products that are similar to everyone else\'s...and not all software categories are like this. CRM certainly is, email Marketing certainly is, Social Media is kind of like that. These categories where there\'s tons of different options, they\'re all kind of similar. People, when they\'re making the decision, they\'re going to lean more into some of the emotive components because if your products are all the same, who wouldn\'t want to work with the brand that\'s a bit more fun, and is a bit more enjoyable, they like more. And so that\'s kind of my thoughts B2B branding, and that\'s why we at G2 went through a rebrand earlier this year, where we dropped the Crowd from our name, so we\'re just G2 now. We completely redid our logo, our brand colors, but it was more than just a visual refresh. It was more actually that we as a company changed our mission, and our focus, and shifted because we understood our buyers a little bit more. So that\'s what I would say on the B2B branding side of the house. On the personal brand and building your own brand on social, I talked about this at Drift\'s conference last year. I keynoted there and spoke about how to build your career and your brand. And I think sometimes people feel embarrassed to toot their own horn, and it doesn\'t need to be that. But I think the way I\'ve always viewed it is that, the bigger my clout as a person, as a marketer, basically the more interesting I am to people so that they follow me, that they want to interview me, they talk to me, they allow me to talk at events - the more valuable I am to an employer. Because I already have a platform to talk to people, right? So, if you think of me in my current role, right? When I go into my next role at my next company - which no idea when that will happen because I love G2 - I\'ve published content for HBR, for the World Economic Forum, for...fuck, there\'s just so many publications now. I all of these connections there because they trust me, and they know that I\'m not writing Salesy content. I am exposing my flaws, and talking about wins, and I\'m giving their writers something of value. And so when I go to my next company, now immediately I have this rolodex of companies that I can write for, and all the buyers they\'re going to say Ryan as the CMO, GCO, etc. of this new company. And I\'ll naturally...I\'m a Marketer, so I\'ll naturally pull in a very natural, lovely way, a mention of that company that\'s super authentic to what I\'m writing about, obviously - and, yeah, it\'s a win-win. And so, I think my lesson for folks listening that are yeah, okay, well it\'s easy to get press when you\'re a CMO and write for these companies - when I wasn\'t a CMO, I still was doing it. You just have to start smaller. And so the step by step process that I told people to do is - you probably already worked for a company, so tap on your content Marketing teams door and say, hey guys, hey gals, I would love to create some content for our company blog. And no content Marketers are going to say no to that because they have really big traffic goals, and they want more content. And say to them, hey, what topics do you guys need content around, and let\'s see if I can find a crossover of where I have a skill set and where you need content. And then work with them, publish some content, publish more content, that helps get you on the map. And then you then might get noticed by someone, and someone might ask you to write for them. But now at least you can at least proactively reach out to tier three publications, and say, "Hey, I write for insert company publication here\', and here are a few links to some of my work. I just recently put wrote this piece of content about topic x, which I think would be a really good fit for your audience. I\'ve pasted it in the email below, let me know what you think. And if you publish it" And that just kind of gets you up and running, you know? And so if that person doesn\'t reply, try another tier three publication. And that\'s genuinely how I did it. And then I went from tier three to tier two. And then when I started creating content for tier one, I referenced my tier two work, and you just slowly work your way up. And then after a while, you don\'t need to reference it anymore because people would just Google your name and they\'ll see all of the content, and that\'s the proof, kind of thing. So, yeah. Naber:\xa0 Excellent. You\'ve been doing this for so long - personally and professionally. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Oh - The only thing I would add as well, Brandon, is that I think for...the biggest asterisk on all this before, and it\'s kind of like what I mentioned with content Marketing, if you don\'t have the right keyword and topic idea from the get go, you will fail. With building your personal brand and writing content. If you aren\'t authentic, and if you don\'t have something unique to say - that\'s key - no one\'s going to publish your bullshit. If I wrote a blog...that blog post that I wrote for Harvard Business Review about why I tell my best employees to seek other job offers - if I wrote why I love to run one on one meetings...like year, no shit, Sherlock. Of course we all know that that\'s important. Like, "Oh Ryan has a different view on career progression and letting people leave." That is interesting. So, that\'s where you need to be a marketer, and you need to think about storytelling. You need to think about your unique skill set, and how you can tell a story that people will want to read. Because I think if you don\'t have that from from the beginning, that no one will ever reply to you and this won\'t work for you. Naber:\xa0 Love it. Unique and authentic. I\'ve heard that over and over from a few different businesses that are great at it, people that are great at it...You\'ve just been doing it for so long, that\'s extremely valuable, and thank you for the examples and all the detail. You\'re running short on time right now. I want to get one rapid fire question, and then we\'ll wrap. Is that okay? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sounds great. Naber:\xa0 Okay, cool. So this is a question, and I explained this to guests each time, this question I usually ask people on their birthdays. Your birthday\'s not until October, October 3rd, I believe, and we both have October birthday, so I got excited when I saw that. It\'s not creepy, maybe it is that I know that. But anyways, the question I was asking is, what\'s the most valuable lesson you\'ve learned in the last 12 months personally? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 The most valuable lesson I think that I\'ve learned in the last 12 months... Naber:\xa0 Personally, we\'ll get to professional in a second. Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, I was just going to go there anyways. It was probably could be more...to be kinder to myself. I think has probably been the biggest lesson that I\'ve learned in the last 12 months. Because I think, this job and this challenge, which was bigger than I had ever taken on, definitely pushed me to my limits last year. And I think, and I\'m in a really good place now. But I got pushed into...and I\'m saying "got pushed" is maybe just a defeatist way of saying that I let myself get too stressed out, or whatnot. As tough as I am on others around me, I\'m 10 times as tough on myself. So that little Freudian slip of "dumb marketers" means that secretly, I think that I am a dumb Marketer. And that\'s, like fact. Like, deep down I\'m insecure that I am that persona. But, I think, I\'ve definitely learned over the last 12 months, through a shit-ton of therapy, to just be kinder to myself. Because everyone is fighting their own battles, whether you can see it or not, and most often times the folks that piss you off the most or that activate something in you, have something deep going on inside of them, but that what you\'re seeing is just their defense mechanism to help them avoid dealing with whatever it is that they were trying to avoid. And I\'ve been there. And so, I don\'t succeed at being kind to myself and others everyday. But I think it\'s something that I\'m actively working on. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Be kinder to yourself. I actually need to steal one more thing because I feel the extra two minutes is going to be worthy of the way that you feel after it, because you\'ve given a lot of really good career advice. What\'s your best career...I think you\'re going to expand on it a little bit earlier. But what\'s some of your best career advice that you have for young professionals as they\'re navigating their career? Ryan Bonnici:\xa0\xa0\xa0 Well, I think my best career advice that people today, young and old, would be that, we\'re really lucky today because of social media, it\'s so easy to find interesting people. And so I touched on before, in terms of what I do when it comes to recruiting, when you see a really cool ad, or if you think about the brands that you love, or the companies that you\'d want to work for, going to Linkedin, to Twitter, to Instagram, and follow all of the leaders at those companies that are doing the awesome work. They\'re sharing content on how they think, how they feel on all of those channels. And so you can learn so much more about them that way. And who knows, maybe you can reach out to them because you study them so well, and you have a really poignant question to ask them that they think was an impressive question. And then they\'ll take time to have coffee with you. And then you get a job offer...I really think that the best way we learn and can grow in our careers is by looking out there and finding who are the best people doing the best work. Let\'s learn from them, and let\'s copy them, and let\'s recreate what they\'re doing in a better way. And so that\'s probably my best career advice. And I think next to that is just, don\'t forget about the relationships in career. And I think, I would say that that was something that I needed to realize a few years back. I think most people though over-index on relationships, and don\'t over-index on results. I was the other way around, which wasn\'t great either. But I think you need to crush your results, right? If your boss tells you to jump here, you jumped double there, or you jump to where they are asked, and show them something else that you jumped to where they didn\'t know they needed to jump. But you also need to do relationships, I think, at the same time. I think you can burn bridges if you don\'t do that. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Ryan, you the man. Thank you so much for being on the show.

Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 I\'m so glad to be here, Brandon. Naber:\xa0 Excellent. Thank you. It\'s July 4th. I\'m sure you don\'t have anything better to do, so I\'m really glad that you\'re spending it with me this morning. and I really appreciate your time. So we\'ve got a lot to talk about. We\'re lucky enough to know each other personally and professionally, so I get to talk about some of my favorite things and hear about your story personally, and we\'ll hop into professional as well, hop through some of your career journey and ultimately, spend the bulk of our time in your professional journey, talking about a lot of the strengths, experiences, and ultimately superpowers that you\'ve built up over time, that you\'ve been able to study about, but also execute on that at several different, really, really high growth businesses. So let\'s start with on the personal side, little bit about you growing up, a little bit about what you were like as a kid. I mean, Hong Kong, Concord, New Hampshire, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Sydney, San Francisco 2.0, been all over the planet. And I\'d love to walk through you as a kiddo and talk about some of your interests, some of the things you\'re interested in, and then your journey through school. And then we can get into some professional stuff. Maybe in five to seven minutes, et\'s talk through what was OJ as a kid? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Awesome. Yeah. Well, so I grew up in Hong Kong. My parents are still there. And, I think even as a child I was always, I was the Lego kid, I was the builder. I was a total nerd throughout. And I excelled in math and science. Not a surprise. And it got to a point where my parents were , okay, math is only going to get you so much here. So they then sent me to boarding school in New Hampshire. Naber:\xa0 And that was St Paul\'s? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 And that would be St Paul\'s. So I went there. That was my entry to the US was a ninth grade. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Excellent. So, what were some of the interests you had or the hobbies you had when you were a kid? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 My main thing was tennis. Tennis was my major hobby growing up. And I think a lot of who I am came from just that sport, because that sport, just like any sport, requires you to be excellent. You just have to be, continue to grind away. A lot of, how I think actually came from that sport and competing, learning how to lose graciously, learning how to stay calm when there\'s, when it\'s things are looking rough. When you\'re down a set, what do you do? I\'m thinking about how do you change your tactics in real time? That all comes from tennis. Naber:\xa0 Absolutely. Especially in an individual sport. We have to be so iterative. Where you do things a thousand times in practice, and it just becomes a transaction when you\'re in the actual match. That makes a lot of sense. So when you moved to St Paul\'s, and you were in Concord, New Hampshire, out of your comfort zone, tell us about that transition. And then let\'s talk about some of the things that you were interested in when you were in New Hampshire and high school. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Boy, so the interesting thing was Saint Paul\'s is one of the top high schools in the US, and that\'s pretty much all my parents knew. And my parents said, you\'re very strong in math and science, but your English sucks, and it\'s just really bad. And they\'re like, you need to supercharge that. And so they looked at the list, I think it was a US News and World Report list. And they had a couple rankings and some names that people have heard of, Exeter, St Paul\'s, whatever. And then so I applied and got in. And I mean St Paul\'s is a real school, in that it\'s academics is intense. And it\'s in the middle of nowhere. I mean, you\'re literally in the woods. I grew up in Hong Kong, I grew up in the heart of the jungle, a concrete jungle, and then I\'m literally moved into a jungle. The school had, I think 200 acres. And I mean, it was nuts. But I learned to adapt. I learned about the American way. Yeah, it was tough, but it was certainly, also the best four years of my academic career. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Very cool. And did you play tennis when you were there? Or what were some of the activities that you were doing? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Yeah, yeah. I was on the tennis team, I was captain of the tennis team there. We were decent, we were decent. I did that, and then I was just lots of part of lots of clubs. But honestly, high school was tough for me. I didn\'t have that much spare time. Obviously, it should be clear, I have tiger parents, right? Obvious. So I did play a violin as well, but I was terrible at it. But I did the orchestra thing, but I was, I was so bad, so bad. But I survived, and I was okay. But I mean, I just, I worked so hard because my English level was far, far, far, behind my peers at school. Naber:\xa0 That must have been so challenging. Learning all that curriculum at such a high level, while you\'re learning how to master the English language yourself. That is immensely complex. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 It was crazy. It was crazy. But, it changed my life. Because when I went to college, I studied philosophy, politics and economics. I went to Penn, right? So I didn\'t go to Wharton and just do a bunch of math and talking about strategy. I mean it\'s funny, I\'m in business now. It\'s so easy compared to a career, or studying old philosophy texts, and debating, and writing papers or why you disagree with Socrates. I mean that\'s...But if I didn\'t go to St Paul\'s, and then of gotten out of my comfort zone, I wouldn\'t have done that. Naber:\xa0 That\'s cool. That\'s actually a really good way of looking at it. The most challenging class I think I\'ve ever had in Uni was my logic class, my philosophy class - deductive reasoning, and logic, and going through all those different frameworks, and squaring everyone from old philosophers, and folks that...it\'s just almost, it feels it\'s impossible with their life experiences to contend and debate with. But that\'s, that\'s really interesting. You moved to U Penn. Why did you decide to choose U Penn? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Actually it was specifically because I really liked this program. So PPE, philosophy, politics and economics, is the most popular major in Oxford, in the UK. And Penn was one of two schools that adopted this program. It sounds fancy. Sometimes when I tell people that, it sounds I tri-majored. It\'s not true. It\'s more than one, but, it\'s this integrated curriculum of three disciplines that I think are really, really tied together. So that\'s why I went to Penn, for that program specifically. Naber:\xa0 Got It. So I won\'t tell anyone you didn\'t tri-major, but it sounds really, really stimulating. So you were at U Penn, What were some of the things you\'re interested in at U Penn? Before we get into your first job. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Like I said, Saint Paul\'s really opened my eyes to the world of humanities, and that\'s why I really loved that. But my interest had always been in business. You grow up in Hong Kong, you\'re going to be in business or you\'re a doctor, right? Or maybe a lawyer. It\'s just what you do, and it\'s in my blood. And so even when I was in high school, I was reading Peter Lynch books on how to invest. And so I\'ve always been interested in business, but I took a couple of business classes and I was like, especially the management ones, and I was like, this is ridiculous. I\'m not gonna pay this tuition to learn how to work as a team. Not to dismiss it, but I\'m like, I don\'t think I\'m going to have a chance again to, to read about Immanuel Kant, and how he thinks about the world. So in college, what I did was I spent most of my time academically on humanities, and then extracurricular was where I got scratch my itch on business. And my biggest thing there is I started the Wharton China Business Society. And back then, it was 2000. China had just gotten into the World Trade Organization, this was before China is the China we know it as today. But you knew it was going to be big. And it\'s cool, that society is still running now. I\'m still getting their emails. Well they keep asking me to for donations. Naber:\xa0 That\'s how you know you made it. All right, cool. So you\'re you go through UPenn, you tri-major, obviously we talked about that. And you\'re interested also in studying business. I know you\'ve always been interested in studying companies. I don\'t know if that\'s at the cost of studying people, but I know you\'ve always been interested in studying companies. Is that when that started? Or did you get more practical with investing at Morgan Stanley, at NEA, at Harvard, before you started studying companies a lot? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 I think the turning point was Morgan Stanley. I mean it was probably that summer internship. I just find it really fascinating. So when I got to Morgan Stanley, and I picked Morgan Stanley because I always liked tech as well. So I\'ve always been a geeky, nerdy guy. And so at Morgan Stanley, I joined the tech team. And I ended up joining team that covered hardware. So companies Cisco, Juniper, and all the companies that died, Nokia, Motorola, they don\'t exist anymore, Nortel. But I just found it so fascinating to think about how a lot of these companies basically sell commodity hardware. A Cisco router is not that much better than Juniper router, or vice versa back then, at that point. Naber:\xa0 That\'s like a nightmare for software, I mean you\'re selling on features and pricing. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Exactly, exactly. And, but you were able to see very, very different trajectories. A lot of these companies no longer exist. A lot of them are still strong today. And that\'s just because of a different strategy that companies took. And I had the opportunity to go really deep. So that\'s why I joined equity research as opposed to a lot of my colleagues that joined investment banking to work on IPO\'s and deals. Because, it\'s probably my humanities background in education that I had led me to want to dig in deep, as opposed to more of a transactional finance job. And that\'s why I ended up in equity research. And through that experience I\'ve really got to learn how to dig into companies. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Very cool. That\'s a great transition. So while you\'re at Morgan Stanley...What\'s the top thing you learned from Morgan Stanley? The top learning you had, before you moved into NEA. And then we\'ll hop into NEA after that. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Ooh, top thing from Morgan Stanley. I actually, I have two things in my mind. So can I give you two? Naber:\xa0 Give me 10 if you want to, I\'ve got time. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Yeah. So the first, is I think of all places, I was extremely fortunate. And I had two great Managers at Morgan Stanley. They were my first bosses. And they say your first Manager really impacts you and your career, more than any other, right? I was just so fortunate because normally you don\'t get that on Wall Street. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Statistics aren\'t on your side. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 And I got placed with Scott Coleman and John Marchetti, and they were up and comers. And they rose through the ranks, and so they know what it took to move up. And they just had a very empowering mentality from the beginning. So they just pushed me, and I always asked for more. But every time, they just really gave me great feedback, pushed me, I learned so much. And they empowered me so much that by the second year I was they put me on stage at the Morgan Stanley tech conference, interviewing tech CEOs. And I was like 2 years out of school. And I think that was a very formative experience because I got to benefit from that, and I know what that did for me, and my career, and my confidence. And we\'ll talk more later about building teams and managing teams, but I\'ve taken a lot of that philosophy from them. I was so lucky. I mean, that would be the number one thing. I will give you that, that was my number one thing I got from Morgan Stanley. Naber:\xa0 Nice. That\'s great. I mean, you\'re going to talk us through NEA. I mean you\'ve worked for incredible companies, and you\'re on team building. Let\'s talk about that. Hiring great teams. One of the things that I know is your superpower from hearing from other people, from talking to you personally, talking to you professionally. But the result speak for themselves. You\'ve hired incredible individuals that I know, because I used to work with them, or I know people that used to work with them, are just the best at what they do. And you consistently do it time, over time, over time. What\'s I\'d love to hear is one, what\'s that hiring philosophy that you took away from those guys, as well as any additional things you\'ve applied today? And then we can talk a little bit about your actual process. Because clearly there\'s something you\'re doing in execution that is better than most, if not better than almost all. So what is your philosophy around hiring that you took away from those guys as well as how you think about it? And then we\'ll talk through the process like, candidate profiling strategy, how do you attract and recruit, how do you close? So we\'ll talk about those things as well. So, what\'s on your mind? Naber:\xa0 I love building teams. I mean, it starts there...let me start with why I care about it. And I think for me, that\'s literally why I think...That\'s where I find meaning in my life. Bringing in high potential talent and seeing it grow, and creating opportunities. And I\'ve always thought of myself, on my deathbed if I\'m seen as the Y-Combinator of talent, I\'ll be really, really happy. And so because of that, I think that it impacts what I look for, because I really look for people who I believe we can go on a journey together, and they can learn from me and I can learn from them, and we\'re going to achieve great things together. That\'s the high level mentality that I have. I really don\'t look at...no matter how senior or whether someone\'s a fresh-out-of-school graduate. I think I can learn something. If I can\'t learn something from you, then I don\'t think you\'re a good fit. But that\'s how I see it. And so it\'s interesting, at Asana, we recently distilled down what are our Sales attributes, the hiring profile, not profile, but what are the attributes or values, depending on how you define it, that we look for. And I was very, very involved you can imagine, because in many ways I think I codified the things that I really value. So there are four pieces that I really care about in every single person that I hired. No matter, again, fresh out of school or you\'re going to run EMEA. The first is someone who really "pursues excellence". What I mean by that is, I want to see evidence that someone knows what excellence means. Because in high growth companies, you\'re growing 100%, 200% early on, 300% in the super early days. Every knows...information is everywhere now. So you can imagine you\'ve got great competition. And so, you gotta go for people who really, really...Well, if you\'re not excellent, you don\'t even have a chance. You don\'t even have a chance to survive. And so, if you\'re fresh out of school, and I\'m digging into your profile, and I don\'t see one thing...And I don\'t care, it could be a violin. If you\'ve gotten really good at violin, I\'m like, oh yeah. And this is sometimes why I think some of my best hires have been teachers. Because, gosh, if you can teach, especially if people from Teach for America, if you can teach math to inner city kids who have no interest in math, okay, you\'ve pursued excellence here. And I think in this world, you either get it or you don\'t. You\'ve either seen excellence, and you know what that means, and what it takes to be great, or you just don\'t. And it\'s very binary, and you can tell very quickly. So someone who does that is something I value a lot. The second piece is, we\'re calling it, you "lead with empathy". And in Sales, of course, if you don\'t have empathy, you\'re not going to understand your customer\'s needs, and you\'re not going to relate to them. You\'re not going to build a good relationship with them. But I think a lot of this is also empathy just in terms of how you work together, right? Like in Sales...you never win because of Sales. This is a huge thing, where a lot of times I\'ve talked to other founders and they\'re like, oh, okay, it\'s time to monetize, but I need to hire some Salespeople. Those Sales people are gonna fail, right? Because Sales is just a part of a bigger engine, because you\'ve got to work together. And working together is fricking hard. It\'s really hard. So if you don\'t lead with empathy, you\'re not going to know how to work together cross-functionally. In Sales, what do Sales people say all the time, every single Sales person, every single Sales leader, I need more leads. Marketing\'s not developing more leads for me. I\'m like, okay, great. Tell me more. How could they be developing more leads for you? And why? Most people can\'t answer that. If you can\'t answer that, just like with a customer, you\'re not going to be able to partner with Marketing to generate the leads that you actually want, right? It\'s not transactional. So anyways, so leading with empathy I think is something really important. And really behind that, what I\'m looking for is self awareness, right? In a fast growing company, you don\'t have the time to coach every single person. You really don\'t. I\'ve got some Managers right now who are managing 14 people because we\'re just growing that fast. And I couldn\'t hire Managers fast enough. That means that of the 14 people, honestly, they\'re not each individually getting the top quality mentorship that, say, I got from two guys at Morgan Stanley. But, if I hire people who are self-aware, they\'re going to teach themselves. They\'re going to look for ways to learn. And that combined with pursuing excellence, you\'re going to get good people. The third piece is what I call, someone on our team defined it as, "do the hard". And this is simple, this is like, you\'ve got to grind. I mean, no one has achieved excellence without grinding away. And Sales is really tough. I mean, literally it is the definition of a grinder job. But also, do you take shortcuts? Sometimes the hard way now is actually the easy way long term. And that\'s what I look for. Are you willing to do, the hard work today so they easier for you later. And the last thing we call it "ascending together", which is your ability to work as on a team. It\'s like, thinking like an owner, right? That\'s something LinkedIn, I think it was one of Jeff\'s big things. It\'s one of my big things too. I remember when I was Morgan Stanley, that\'s what John Mack said when he was running the company. Now this is a big bank, Morgan Stanley. When he first said that, I was like, yeah, how am I going to change the trajectory of Morgan Stanley as a first year analyst. But, I did think that way, I really did, and I love that. So, those are some of the high level qualities that I look for in anybody. Naber:\xa0 Nice. That\'s awesome. One follow up on that, that was really well articulated, thanks. And the one follow-up on that...Do you have a particular process you go through? Let\'s talk about hiring directly on your team, your team, your directs. Do you have a particular process you go through around candidate profiling, attracting that candidate, and you reaching out to them either personally, or the message that you craft? Going through the recruitment, and interviewing process, and then closing. Do you have any tactics that you think completely set you apart from, maybe what other people do, just based on the results that you\'ve gotten? You know that they work. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 I don\'t know if it\'s differentiated, but I\'ll tell you how I approach it. I think the first step is you really have to understand the nuances of the role that you\'re trying to hire for. This is a mistake I see a lot in companies. Especially early stage companies, at some point they have like 10 Salespeople, they\'re hitting quota, kind of. And then the Board\'s like, you need a VP of Sales. And then they go and the hire some kind of recruiting firm, and they load them up with VP Sales candidates, and they just hire someone to do VP Sales. And that happens every day. And, I think there\'s so many nuances to the rule. What kind of Sales? How do you want to build it? And, what types of talent would you want this person to bring in? And, so I am a big believer that you don\'t know how to hire for that role unless you\'ve done that job yourself, for at least a quarter or two. I think as you get better, you use pattern matching and shortcut. But in the beginning, you have to do it yourself...in the Sales world, so you know what type of companies are you really, really going after and such. And so that\'s my first step. Because even though I\'m desperate for bandwidth, and I would just love to hire someone right now to just take the job, if I don\'t dig in myself, I don\'t think I\'ll hire her right, the best person for that job. So that\'s first, and I think that helps a lot downstream, and I\'ll come back to it. Second is, I leveraged my network. So I leverage my network, and I go talk to people. You and I have talked. I\'m like, hey, I\'m looking for this person. And now I know what I\'m looking for, right? Who\'s the best two people you know? And I don\'t need to recruit them, but I want to talk to them. Naber:\xa0 You do this a lot. You do this a lot. To the point where sometimes I know you\'re in the market for someone because either I\'m close with someone that might be one of the best in the market, and I\'m hearing that you had a conversation because he or she and I will talk, and hear that, OJ had a conversation. You do this, it is perpetual, it is in your nature, perpetually to do this all the time. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 And I think part of it is, I find it interesting, right? It\'s like, you get to learn. It\'s free education, why not? And so I constantly do that, that\'s true. And then I get referrals. I remember when I moved out to Australia to run, to start Dropbox APAC, and back then LinkedIn when you were there, LinkedIn was one of the top SaaS organization. Smaller than Salesforce, but the talent was super high quality, right? I canvas the top three layers. I talked to every single person across Sales, Marketing, Talent Solutions, everybody...and that\'s how I met great people Gareth. So, that\'s step two. Step three is then obviously building that list and talking to people. And I think this is one where, I don\'t know if it\'s different, but I do it myself. I do it myself. I reach out. I mean, I\'m looking for a Head of BD right now. I\'m the one who\'s InMail\'ing people. I don\'t outsource it to a recruiter. And I think that makes a big difference. Because if you\'re a top talent, you want to hear from...you want your best shot at this person, right? So I do it myself. And when I get in touch with these people, and I think this is where having done the job yourself for at least a quarter to really, really make a difference, because then now you can talk about the role in a much more sophisticated way. You\'re not like, I\'m just hiring someone to run east coast...Someone is interested it when you\'re able to map the distinct qualities needed for someone to be successful in a certain role, and why that candidate is a perfect fit. Naber:\xa0 There\'s something ultra sexy about that. There\'s something ultra sexy about that from a candidate perspective. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Because the candidate, people have choices. There\'s so many great companies out there. And what candidates want to know, ultimately no matter where and who, is that they\'re going to be set up for success. And so I think that comes across when you actually know what you\'re looking for, and then you can talk about why that person...Hey Brandon, I\'m talking about you, and you specifically, because of XYZ, and that XYZ is exactly what I\'m looking for. And that makes it a lot better. And then I also think a lot, again, you gotta develop that relationship, especially if you\'re hiring General Managers...If you treat it as just a process, that\'s where I\'ve seen these things fail. I mean, I\'ve seen bad hiring practices, even at Dropbox where I was, where you meet a lot of hiring mistakes. It was when you make these critical roles that you just rush through a process. I\'m gonna go find an executive recruiter from, they\'re gonna bring me 20, and then I\'m going to whittle it down to three, bring people back onsite, pick one. Those almost never work out because you don\'t have that trust developed, or you can\'t close. Because that trust has not been built up throughout the process. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Those are great. Those are great. All right. I feel people are going to be furiously writing down notes in audience, much slower than you can talk about this stuff. All right, let\'s move into NEA...So you\'re at Morgan Stanley, you make the jump to NEA. Why do you make that jump? What are you doing there? And then I\'ve got a couple of questions for you. Naber:\xa0 Cool. NEA was the world\'s largest venture capital fund. And back then they were, they had never hired pre MBA analysts before, so I was a guinea pig of the first class. Essentially all of these partners just wanted people to do their work for them. And fast forward, now NEA I think has 20 analysts because it\'s like, wow, that\'s great to get people to do great work, do all that work for them. NEA - why did I join NEA? Well, first why did I join venture, go into venture capital. And when I was in equity research, I got into the business of studying companies, and giving buy, sell, neutral ratings on every stock, right? You go to CNBC, and there\'s someone talking about their stock, that was me. Well, that wasn\'t me, I didn\'t go on TV, but that\'s the work I did. Behind that analyst on TV, there\'s some baby, junior OJ who is crunching numbers. What I realized about my job that I liked was actually understanding the company, the strategy of companies, and the technology of companies. Back then, that was right when iPhone came out. And I made a bad call, by the way. I was like, Blackberry, RIM, remember Research in Motion? Blackberry is for consumers. Remember this company called Palm - PalmPilot remember? Palm is for prosumers. When the iPhone came out, I was like, this is for consumers. Don\'t worry. Buy more Blackberry. Buy, buy, buy. Obviously I was wrong. But anyways, I love that analyses. What I did not care about was the actual finance. I can do the job, but whether Cisco is going to trade to 35 or 33, I just didn\'t care. It was almost too easy. It was like, okay, I can look at a stock chart, after a month be like, okay, it\'s going to pop back up. Naber:\xa0 Humanities OJ comes out again. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 I think so. It\'s just not for me. It wasn\'t fulfilling. if I made a really great call, and I helped a client make a ton of money, I just didn\'t find that rewarding. So, venture sounded interesting because it sounded it was like, okay, I\'m still leveraging some of my analytical background, but I can dig deep into strategy and technology. So that\'s why I learned to venture. And there was a really a crazy adventure where I got to work with a great farm. Also, so fortunate work with some such great Managers, who empowered me and challenged me. And that\'s when I got closer to entrepreneurs, and founders. And my job there was due diligence for deals that came in. NEA got great deal flow because it was one of the best firms. So the pressure was more on diligence, and then working with companies, which is great. And then as I worked more with companies, and if we fast forward, that\'s why I ended up working as, becoming an operator. I was like, wow, that seems fun. It was funny because it gave me that kind of exposure. Naber:\xa0 Nice. I read a quote that you had mentioned, in a couple places, that you saw the fun the operators were having, and you wanted to hop on that side of the coin. And I think it\'s well said. So when you were there at NEA, I\'ve got two particular things that over your career, you\'ve been good at...But since we\'re on NEA, and you\'ve had a ton of exposure to a lot of different types of companies and deals, it could have been one of the places where the seeds were planted for these two things. The first one is around picking horses, picking the right companies that are going to take off, and understanding the process you need to go through in your mind for one, picking that business, and two, evaluating as to whether or not you would want to hop on board. You\'ve done an amazing job with evaluating them for the companies that you\'ve joined, Dropbox and Asana as an operator, as well as a bunch of businesses you\'ve helped, either been a Board Observer, or you\'ve been a Board Director on a bunch of different types of companies. So when you\'re thinking about picking horses, what is the criteria you think about for joining a company? And like you said, people have options that are the best...that it being worthy of one, you looking at it, and two, you hopping on board? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Yeah, it\'s I absolutely learned that from venture. And as a result of that, I look at everything from a investor lens now. When it comes to picking horses, I think...two of the most legendary investors in the valley, Dick Kramlich was a founder of NEA, and Forest Baskett who is still a GP there and just incredibly smart. Basically, when Tableau was founded, he worked with the early founders in the NEA offices to start Tableau. And I asked them, hey, what\'s what\'s the secret? Because there are some venture investors that are just clearly better than others. What\'s the secret? Naber:\xa0 Yeah, top quartile year over year. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 What\'s the secret? I mean, when I asked them, I was amazed...Dick was like, find companies that are going after really large markets. And you\'re like, okay, duh. Naber:\xa0 Let me just write that down. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 But as I\'ve matured, and I\'ve looked into different companies, and how markets have matured, I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve told people on my teams who want to go to some company gave them some VP Sales job, and it sounds great, but the category is just not that big. And I think that\'s number one, you have to pick a company that has an exploding market, and most importantly is timing. Is the market about to explode now. Let\'s take a couple of examples. Let\'s look at Zoom and Slack, two examples recently. Zoom was one of the best IPO\'s of all time. I mean incredible IPO. Messaging, I mean, I remember the days in 95 when we were using ICQ. I don\'t know if you ever used ICQ. I still remember my ICQ number, right? We were messaging. Slack versus ICQ, or later MS Messenger, is honestly not that different. And then there was Skype in the middle. So, why is this so different? Do I really believe that the UI is so amazing that that\'s the reason. Like, okay, maybe, but I don\'t know if that\'s a $20 billion difference. It\'s just that somewhere, in the B2B world around 2014, the market tipped. There was a need in the market for more dynamic communications because the pain of email was just too high, for that use case. And CIO\'s started believing in it. And that\'s when it tipped. And that market, the enterprise messaging market, basically tipped in 2014 to 2016, I would say. In those two years the winner, it\'s a winner take all market...There\'s good research that shows that when a category tips, you get a flood of competitors, and then within two years, 18 to 24 months, the leader ends up taking I think 78%, something that, call it 80% market share of the market. But if the market is huge, you can go into a big market and you\'ll still be okay, right? Remember there\'s a company called Jive, right? And remember Yammer? Remember there was a Chatter? All the still did okay, but if you want the get the $20 billion market cap that Slack got, you have to be the winner during that window when the market is ready to tip. And I would say the same thing about video conferencing. Zoom...this is nothing new. I mean, that\'s how my wife and I developed a relationship, right, over video conferencing, over Instand Messenger - AOL, by the way, another messaging tool. And look, somewhere between 2015 to 2017, maybe even later, was when the need really, really tiped, and now you see Zoom taking off. And you and I now, we\'re doing this podcast via Zoom, and we use it all the time. Same thing with file storage. Dropbox, is generating $1.4 billion in recurring revenue for file sharing. Naber:\xa0 Fastest company to $1 billion for a SaaS business ever? Is that right?...ARR. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 That\'s right. That\'s right. And they didn\'t invent file storage. I remember when I first used Yahoo in 1995, I got to upload a file into Yahoo, and then download it when I was in the library. It was life changing. Yeah, it was amazing. So it\'s not new. Cloud storage wasn\'t new. It\'s just that the market tipped at that point where people were starting to move away from servers. And in 2013 to 2014 was when mobile adoption in the enterprise had hit a certain rate, and that\'s when you needed cloud storage. Because on mobile, you can\'t access files anyway. So number one, you\'ve got to pick a huge market, and most importantly, you\'ve got to join that market right before the market tips. And so you have to make a call. I joined Asana when people were like, what is this project management thing? I don\'t know what it is. Forrester and Gartner haven\'t written reports on it yet. But I asked the most progressive CIOs, what\'s next? They\'re like, well, I just put in Slack, and now all my work is fragmented even in more places than before. I need something to pull it back together. So I\'m going to look into this project management, work management space. And I\'m like, oh, interesting. So I developed this hypothesis that the capstone of the new modern collaboration stack is going to be something like Asana that pulls things back together, at least for the things that I really did matter to that company. And I\'m seeing that market...we are in the heart of the race right now, that 18 to 24 month window. So that\'s number one. Number two is obviously what people generally look for which is technology, right? If this market is going to tip, does this company have the right technology to win? And this is very much a venture thing, where you need to some make some calls on the architecture, how they built it. What are customers saying about the product, right? That\'s when you get some feedback. So the second thing is, does this company have the right product to win the market. Because I do think, especially in the B2B now, SaaS more and more, is dictated by the end user and what they use. So you gotta make sure you\'re the one that people are gonna pick. And then the last part is, do you have the right team? Does this company have the right team that you\'re going to back? And that\'s probably the number one thing, besides the size of market, that venture capitalists bet on, is the people. Because early stage you don\'t really have much of a business yet. Or even a product. And I think in terms of picking companies to join, same thing, right? Let\'s say you join a Series C company, what is the management team? What are the dynamics? When things go south, which always happens, how does that management team work together to solve them? Or is there finger pointing? 90% of the time it\'s fingerpointing. 90% of the time Sales says Marketing didn\'t generate enough leads. Well, no, let me start...Customer Success and Support says Sales as closing crappy deals. Sales says well, what do you expect? Marketing is driving these bad leaves? Marketing goes, well, what do you expect our Product is missing all this stuff. Product goes well, that\'s because design is a bottleneck, and it\'s not shipping. We\'re not shipping fast enough because design is not ready. Design is like, well, you know what, it\'s not my fault. I can\'t hire enough designers, it\'s recruiting, right? Recruiting..it just goes on. And when I say 9 our of 10, I think that it\'s 9.8 out of 10. And I made this mistake myself. Before Dropbox, I joined a company that I probably shouldn\'t have. So a lot of people look at the company profile, and the executives, and where they came from. Oh, this person was at Google for 20 years. Well, you know what, so have like 10,000 other people. And you\'ve seen this at LinkedIn, not everyone\'s a star at LinkedIn buddy. A lot of stars. But, quite a few duds too. Naber:\xa0 Totally. I mean, nature of large numbers like that, for every one of those businesses. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Totally. Totally. Or they haven\'t seen the right stage that\'s relevant for your company. So, finding the right team that you think you can bank on just to get through the hard times is really, really important. Don\'t just look at the profile. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Awesome. Great answer. Okay. So, we\'ve gotten through NEA right now. At this point, I believe you jump into Harvard, correct? HBS. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Yeah. Naber:\xa0 Cool. So take us through the reason you decided to go get your MBA. Why Harvard, which may be self-explanatory. And then take us all the way up through your decision to join Dropbox. So through that period, Scientific Conservation, Harvard, etc, up through the point where you\'re joining Dropbox. And then we\'ll talk about what you were responsible for there. And I\'ve got some, a couple of questions for that. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Yeah, sure. So I decided when I was at NEA that I wanted to be on the operating side. So I was like, they have all the fun. I didn\'t understand how much pain they had either, honestly, but I was like, it sure seems fun. And, the short answer of why I decided to get my MBA...I was like, okay, well if I got into a great school, I might as well take a break because I\'m going to make this career switch anyways. So I\'ll just do it. And that\'s literally the logic. And this was mainly...I remember one of my mentors at NEA, John S., who\'s a fantastic guy, fantastic...Remember remember there was this company called The Ladders? Naber:\xa0 Yeah, of course. Yeah. The $100K+ jobs is their thing, right? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Yeah, yeah, yeah. What happened with them? Naber:\xa0 They died. I have no idea. It was almost overnight. Because I remember, I mean, I did a lot of research on ladders for at some point in my career. Anyways, I don\'t know, they just died at some point. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 So we we\'re going to meet with The Ladders in New York. I remember this clearly. This was right around the recession starting, and John\'s just like, you need to apply to business school. And this was October, and the deadline was coming up in December. So I was like, all right. He convinced me that would be good. I mean, I might as well, I\'m going to try it. John\'s like, you\'re probably not going to get in, and that\'s cool, but why not try? Because getting into business school, certainly getting into HBS, is a total crapshoot. It\'s a total lottery. Yeah. I got some friends who were way more qualified than I am and didn\'t get in. And I now know it\'s for sure a crap shoot. So anyways, I applied. And I only had time to apply to one school, and that was not the plan, but I just didn\'t have time because I had to take the GMAT, write the essays, get the recommendation, all that. I only applied to Harvard assuming that I didn\'t get in. And then I got in. Naber:\xa0 Stop it. Hold on. This is unbelievable. Hold on, hold on. So you only applied to Harvard and you got end up... Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Yeah, it wasn\'t because I had so much confidence or that it was the only school that I would go to. I was gonna apply to like five. But dang it, man, these essays, they take like...I haven\'t written these essays in a long time, and they go back to humanities OJ. It took forever. I just didn\'t have time. I think the the application was due January 1st or something, and I remember over Christmas I was writing these essays and I was just like, I don\'t have time for this. And I just applied one. I really didn\'t think I was going to go to business school, and then I got it in. And I\'m like, oh, okay. I guess I\'m going. Naber:\xa0 No one can see me losing a right now. Laughing silently while I\'m listening to this, and not believing it. This is a great story about getting into Harvard Business School. Such a good story. All right, so you\'re at Harvard, what\'s the biggest thing you learned there? And then take us through up to you joining Dropbox. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Ah, man. Yeah. So Harvard was great. Naber:\xa0 You must have met some really cool, interesting people. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 I met some amazing people. And people that I considered to be my best friends today. That\'s where I met the co-founders of Grab, I\'m on their board now. I met a lot of great professors.Look, I think the thing about business school...A lot of people poo poo on business school. They\'re like, it\'s expensive, you don\'t learn anything, it\'s just networking. I mean, I call bullshit on that. Because I\'m a nerd, I to learn. And so I studied. I\'m like, wow, this is interesting. And I\'ll tell you at that point I was going through this big clean tech phase in my life. I was really interested in clean tech. I was doing clean tech investments at NEA. I was part of the environment group at HBS. I was super active. I thought I was going to build a career in clean tech. And now that I\'m selling productivity software for the past seven years, it\'s given me a different kind of perspective looking back. But I was so into clean tech. And I met some great people through that, through other who have similar interests. But I\'ll tell you, so my first job was Scientific Conversation - they basically sell building automation software to help optimize the equipment in commercial buildings to optimize their energy spend. Think of it as HVAC optimization software. I would not have been able...and I took a Sales role coming out of school, which is interesting because very few people go to HBS to come out to be a Sales guy. It\'s pretty rare. And I sold to real estate developers. And if I did not take a real estate class at HBS, I wouldn\'t know how to speak that lingo. Cap rates, and TNI, and whatever. I mean it\'s just, there\'s different things. I learned that from school. And then what was really interesting was then Scientific Conversation went through a big period of restructuring. And I had to be a big part of that. I took this class called turn arounds, because it\'s a new topic, when you learn about - how to turn around companies? How do you learn about bankruptcy law? You learn about how to negotiate with your creditors so you can live to die another day, so to speak. And then I used those skills. I literally looked up my notes on bankruptcy. Because I would call our creditors, and it\'d be like, hey man, we\'re about to go under here. I\'m going to give you, I know I owe you $2 million, I\'m gonna give you $2,000, or you can have a shot at bankruptcy court. Anyways, long story short, business school was awesome. I met great people, and I learned a ton, got great exposure, and I actually implement the things that I learned. Naber:\xa0 Wow. That\'s great. Great Story. Okay. So Boston, Beantown, you leave. Scientific Conversationis next, you join in a Sales and Partnerships capacity. Every Harvard Business Schoolers dream, joining Sales right after that. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 That\'s why you go to HBS. Naber:\xa0 That\'s right. #HBS. So what is the biggest thing that you learn at that business, and why did you join Dropbox? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Well, a lot of my lessons learned around the people, in part, was what I learned at Scientific Conservation. It had on paper, all the things that most people look for, right? I said, oh, pre rocket ship, hot industry, a team that looked really, really strong on paper. That\'s what I went for. You know, hypergrowth. I remember Kleiner Perkins, NEA, Accel. Everybody was like, this is the next one, this is the next OPOWER. This is the commercial version of OPOWER. I thought it was the best thing. But you know what, just didn\'t have the right team to execute going through the tough times. and that\'s what I learned. That\'s honestly the biggest lesson I learned. I met a lot of great people. But that\'s where I really realized, wow, so much of execution is the people, and the chemistry of those people. And that\'s what I learned there. So why did I Dropbox? Honestly, I mean...we had to do a big turn around in Scientific Conservation. Within a year we went from 30 people, to 180 people, and then I had to play a big part in restructuring down back to 90 people, and then down to 50 people. I mean it was a year that felt 10 years. So Dropbox, I showed up, people on scooters, drinking from coconuts...you\'ve been to the office. It was just a different world. I\'m over here trying to make payroll, literally. There was a payroll period where I... Naber:\xa0 And letting people go daily. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Ugh, brutal. People always ask, what\'s the biggest done, whatever. I\'ll say the biggest deal I\'ve done was in...I broke my lease, the Scientific Conservation lease with a real estate developer...Because we had signed this Embarcadero Bay Bridge View Office for a seven year lease, even though the company was making zero in revenue, so that tells you something. But thankfully, the one thing that went in our favor was the rental rates have actually gone up in SF. Far, far greater than our committed rate of increase in her seven year lease. So they way I made payroll was, I went to the developer and I said, I will break the lease if you give me x amount of money. Well, they didn\'t know it was how we were going to make payroll. It was hilarious. And then negotiation, at the end the thing that clinched the deal was office furniture. I was like, I\'ll throw in the office furniture. Naber:\xa0 Stop it. I always find it mind blowing when in residential, someone rents someplace for like, a few grand more a month just because the furniture\'s included. And that was your deal with the developer. That guy has done tons of deals, tons of deals, and this guy closes over the furniture. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Honestly, I probably would have gotten it done anyways. I was actually in my head thinking, I don\'t want to pay to get rid of the furniture. That was what was going to be my head. Naber:\xa0 Oh, that\'s a good win-win. All right, so you join Dropbox. There\'s coconuts, there\'s cupcakes, there\'s all of it. So walk us through in one or two minutes, what you were responsible for and the jumps that you made at Dropbox. And then I\'ve got a few questions around some of your super powers, okay? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Yeah. So Dropbox I went in as one of the first business generalists. There wasn\'t a role, it really just do everything. So, looking to our payments gateway infrastructure, looked into capital financing for our data center to help raise capital. I looked into real estate because they\'re like, oh, now you\'re a real estate pro from my background. So I had to try to figure out finding office space. Andthis was all in the first three months. We were moving so fast. And and then there was this business called Dropbox for Teams that was starting to grow really, really quickly. And the Head of Business, our COO was like, can you just take a look at that. Basically, do the Sales Ops work to see what\'s going on. And that\'s how I got into it. And then one thing led to another. So took that role on, started adding some visibility into the business. And then moved into actually managing part of it. And ended up running a lot of it, growing the North America Online and Inside Sales teams to 70 or so people. And then got the opportunity to co lead our APEC expansion efforts. Naber:\xa0 With Tony, is that right? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 With Tony, that\'s right. And they\'re like, all right, figure it out. I mean, that was it. Figure out APAC, period. So then we did that, that led to both of us moving out to APAC for a year and a half. Started the Australia office, Japan office, I was gonna think about Singapore, but didn\'t end up doing Singapore. Also looked at Latin America, when the new CEO joined. He\'s like, well, there\'s another continent. Someone\'s going to look at it. And they just put it on our plate. And then did that for a while. And then when I came back to the US, transitioned into the Corp Dev team, so think about M&A at Dropbox. And then through that experience I realized I really missed building teams. Which is why I went back to the Sales world at Asana. Naber:\xa0 Nice. After hearing your story, and I saw a lot of firsthand when I was working with teams at Dropbox and I\'m working with teams at Asana, now I get that, why you made that jump. Or at least why that was the right time in your life, and in missing teams to want to make that jump. Wow. That\'s really interesting. Okay. So a couple things about Dropbox. There is a theme, and you\'ve done this really interestingly coming at it from, let\'s call it the Sales Ops angle first, and then jumping into manage these teams. Which some of the best operators I know from a Sales and Marketing perspective, have come from the Ops side. I look at them as the Ying to my Yang. They speak a beautiful language and I want to hear all of it. So as you\'re doing that, you\'re building things from scratch. And you are building at one phase at Dropbox, and you go through a lot of different phases of growth in your international expansion playbook. You\'re also going through phases you\'ve been in before at Asana, and planning for phases that are things you\'ve seen before, and things you know a lot about. So let\'s talk about your international expansion playbook. As you\'re going through phase by phase, and one, making the decision as to whether or not you should do it in the first place - Expanding outside of, let\'s call it the US for now, into other markets? And then two, once you decide yes through that evaluation process, you want to go about doing it. What\'s your step by step process you\'re going through in order to expand internationally? You can use the Dropbox example or the Asana example, or both, If you just want to say, hey, this is what we did then and this is what we did then. But either way, what\'s your phase by phase and step by step approach as you\'re executing on this expansion playbook. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 So I think the first is understanding that international operations is not...Adding international operations is, honestly from management overhead perspective, it\'s the minute you go international, for every new region and office you add is equivalent of adding two, and the next one you add is like adding three. There\'s a complexity, the overhead is so much more, and sophistication is so much greater. And that\'s not to say it\'s not worth it, right? Obviously I do it, but it\'s something that I think you need to be really, really honest with yourself, with your teams on whether or when are you ready for that? Because honestly, one of the things that I think about is, most companies go international too late, right? I think Slack is a good example. Slack to me, and I have a lot of good friends at Slack, so maybe you have to delete this. But, international is only 30% of their revenue, or 35% of their revenue at this scale. And I think Microsoft got a jump on them internationally. Well Microsoft has a jump on everybody, but especially internationally. And so, you want to go fast, but you got to make sure you commit. So step one, before you commit 100%, what you can do is just play the digital game. Localize your product, localize your ads, localize your website. And I would say probably even in that order. Again, it depends on what product you have, right? But if you have a user facing product...and in Enterprise it starts with the product. In many countries you may have one or two people who aren\'t very comfortable with English, but the rest of the team may not be. And you\'re not going to get good adoption that way. So I think that\'s important, localize your product, as long as you feel you have enough confidence that it\'s worth the engineering investment. Because it\'s a big investment. There\'s a certain threshold where you\'re going to start seeing...Whether it\'s tickets that come in asking for your language, or your community, you\'ll get that ask. Yeah, I mean, maybe French and Spanish, the website, that\'s as an obvious one. But what\'s interesting is you can some good lift from just localizing the ads, in Dutch or Japanese, and it points to an English website. You\'re still going to get some incremental dollars there. So play the digital game. And then at some point, and you have to come up with a framework, and it\'s different company to company, and you don\'t have to be that Scientific. But at what point do you feel you\'re ready to go open an additional office? And almost always, you\'ll see English speaking markets adopt first - UK, Australia, are the next two, and Canada. Large markets that, for many reasons, and we\'re not gonna have enough time talking about them, but they usually are the next to adopt technologies. And so your next move almost guaranteed is going to be somewhere in Europe, right? And you pick between Dublin, Amsterdam or London and we can talk about which one, why, but it\'s going to be one of those three almost guaranteed, right? So setup your Europe hub. And then depending on the type of company, you can think about growing from there. So then the most obvious, next markets would be France and Germany in Europe. And so then you got to make that decision on whether you want to service those markets in whichever hub you\'ve picked, or you go even more local. And I think that depends on the type of company that you have. We talked about Australia, that makes a ton of sense already. The minute you\'re looking into the UK, if you have the bandwidth, you should look in Australia as well. I would think that the market demand would be equivalent in terms of the time. And then Japan. Japan, people forget, is the second largest IT market in the world. And they\'re early in their cloud adoption. But for SaaS companies, it\'s really starting to take off. And so Japan is a market where investing in early can pay off dividends three, four years down the road. Japan is Slack\'s number two market. It\'s Salesforce\'s number two market. But it takes years to build up that market. And so you can start thinking about that. So the order of sequencing, I guess I\'m not even...I guess I\'ve done it enough now to just know the sequence instead. I mean the first time I did this at Dropbox it was like, okay, how many users do we need to see before we go green light here? How much revenue? How many businesses? How many domains we want to see? And, I\'ve traveled so much in the last couple of years. This is the order that I would go in, Naber:\xa0 Good one. Awesome. You know what\'s really interesting about that, is you mentioned you\'ve looked at the data, and from the data side it says to do this, this, and this. What you\'re saying is don\'t necessarily do the work that everyone else has has done. This is an all likelihood, the chronology of the markets that you will go into next. And that\'s really interesting. Don\'t redo all the work. Do not reinvent the wheel. I have two follow-up questions to that. One is how do you know whether to hire local, even more local, versus doing it from a regional hub? How do I know whether or not I should sell from Dublin or London or Amsterdam into France, Germany, Spain, Italy, some of the Nordic countries, etc? Or hire local in that particular market? And by that I mean, when do I do it? And I\'ll ask the other question after that. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Yeah. To me it all depends on your target audience. Who are you trying to go after and how? So if you\'re going after SMBs, this is primarily going to be Inside Sales function. You\'re not showing up. It\'s not a relationship sale. Then there is so much value in centralizing to the last minute that you can because you\'re still trying to figure it out. So Asana is small deals, we start with small teams and then we expand them. And, we essentially have a big machine in Dublin. Why? Because the French rep who has learned some new insight selling to Mid-market & SMB companies in France can share with the Nordic Rep, and those best practices when you\'re early in a region, you got to learn quickly, and you\'re gonna to learn from the field. And that information transfer is so valuable. And then eventually you go the other way. You launch a new product, you\'ve got to enable the team. There\'s a lot of operational overhead to enabling lots of people in the field, versus you just fly into in one office, and you basically enable a team all at once. So huge, huge advantage to centralizing. However, if your Sales cycle and process relies a lot on relationship building, whether it\'s for bigger deals, whether it\'s a complex deal that relies on partners, then you need to go in the field. And that\'s where showing up makes a ton of sense. And what changes is the unit economics of that office, where if you open an office in Paris, now showing up at a mid-market opportunity of a 10K Pounds deal, normally is not going to justify a flight in, hotels, make it work. But now it\'s just, down the street. I mean not down the street, but now you can justify making that visit, and absolutely everything that increases the conversion rate. So there is benefit there too. But balancing operational overhead, learning earlier, I am a big believer that you should hold off as long as you can. Because once you\'re decentralized, there\'s no way you can centralize again. Or you can, but it\'s very painful. You gotta shut down offices, and it\'s really painful. So you want to wait as long as possible. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Great answer. Thank you. And then, second question is...So you\'re going through this process of massive expansion, within Dropbox and Asana, and you\'re going through different stages of growth. One of the things that you need to constantly think about...which I don\'t necessarily believe that a large number of Heads of Sales and Heads of Marketing are very good at this. One of the things you need to constantly be aware of...and coming from VC, you\'ve got interesting perspective on this, and not all the people who have gone from VC to operator and done it with the amount of, not only success, but the amount of speed that you\'ve done it...So a Head of Sales and Marketing needs have the right mindset, with planning and execution, with unit economics in mind. So how do you make sure that you have the right mindset? What is your mindset when you\'re thinking about balancing, things LTV to CAC ratios, versus booking in revenue growth rate expectations, versus the growing pains of teams and the engagement of those teams. How do you think about incorporating unit economics into your approach? And how do you think about that as a Head of Sales and Marketing? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Okay. So I would say there\'s a couple of things. First in terms of mindset, if you\'re leading Sales and Marketing, let\'s say your company is growing at 100%, right? My mindset, and I tell this to all my Managers, is that my job is to plan and execute as if we were 12 months from now. My Manager\'s job is to execute and plan as if we were six months from now. Your IC\'s are the ones who were executing to quarter to quarter. And I think that\'s something that I always drill into my team, and my Manager because most people manage to the quarter. And by the time you manage to a quarter, you\'ve already forgotten about the next one, and you\'re basically accumulating debt. And I think part of what\'s challenging and exciting about managing in high growth, is you\'ve got to balance executing and the job at hand, but at the same time develop the vision of where you need to get to - So if you\'re a line Manager six months from now - and you\'ve got to do both at the same time. So as my leads, they got the quarterly number, that\'s great. I just assume they\'re going to hit it. I mean just tell me if you\'re not going to hit it, but I\'m assuming you\'re going to hit it. What are the programmatic things you\'re building in right now as if you\'re six months from now? Because that is going to take time to build it. And then once you build it, boom, now you\'re ready. My job is 12 months. So right now, I\'m thinking about what my team needs to be doing this time next year. Because, well, my team is getting pretty big now. It\'s hard to steer a big ship. And so if I\'m optimizing for something for the end of the year, not to say that\'s I don\'t do that, I do that. But I also push myself to think longer because for me, and from my angle, what\'s going to happen in the second half of this year has already been shipped. Our performance, our unit economics, our, whatever programmatic infrastructure we build is going to be, it\'s already too late to change that. So I\'m thinking ahead. I think that\'s important because, you mentioned about unit economics, your unit economics need to change over time. And so you got to work with your management team, your finance team, to understand what unit economics you need to have this time next year. So that you can slowly migrate there. Otherwise you\'re just hiring heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, and eventually you\'re like, oh, one day you wake up and finance is like, okay, you\'re going to get three heads next year, but you have the grow revenue revenue by 50%. So that\'s the high level mindset that I think is really important, to understand end state first, and work with finance to understand what that looks like. And so I know next year what my unit economics need to be. Now, I can start back filling. And then this is what I do to backfill. So what I do is, I ask my teams to now start thinking about, not unit economics first though, strategy. First strategy, then tactics, then numbers. So for example, my team in Europe. Right now, it\'s July, and it\'s the end of our quarter this month. The leads are going to come over to the US and present their strategy for next year, so basically the next 18 month strategy. What do I mean by strategy? Who\'s our primary customer? Who are we trying to win over and outserve everybody else. Why? And where are we going to focus? Because you can\'t go after everything. And when I think about Europe as an example, a microcosm of the world, the UK is very different than Germany, which is very different than Spain, and very different than the Nordics. So, if someone calls me and tells me this is my EMEA blanket strategy, I\'m like, that\'s not a strategy. I want you to define what winning looks in the Nordics, and define what winning looks in Spain. Portugal, not as important to me, lump it into that region. Iberia, right? Or something. But, I think it\'s important that to have a view where you define success. Okay, this is what I\'m trying to accomplish in Germany. Align on that first. That\'s a strategy. Then the tactics. How are we going to do that? Okay. in Germany we\'re going to go after this segment hard. Now what\'s the tactics? How are we going to do it? What are what are the resources that we need to make that happen? How much revenue? Well, we won\'t get a numbers yet, but just tell me how are you going to get it done? For example, at Asana, we think in Germany there\'s a big digital transformation push, moreso than any other countries that we see, right? And there\'s historical reasons why that is, but it is moving. So to us, it makes sense that the tactic is to really build field, right? And that\'s why we\'re going to build field in Munich and not Berlin, because it has a lot more of in your more iconic traditional companies, Berlin\'s a tech hub. The strategy in Germany, for field, is to go after digital transformation opportunities. I would say a lot of companies make the mistake and they go tactics first. They go, oh, okay, this is what we\'re doing right now. And so the next year we\'re going to do this. And you don\'t actually understand what it ladders up to. And your tactics may not actually end up hitting the strategy that you actually really want. You got your strategy down, on a region by region basis. You got your tactics. Then you\'ve got to figure out numbers. What is the target that you want to get? Because remember, we\'ve already defined success region by region. Now we\'re going to deploy resources, and see what do you need for that? How much field Marketing do you need? Oh, I need to sponsor this conference, I need two Sales Engineer\'s, five AE\'s, three SDR\'s, and whatever. Okay, great. And then I can come in, and I know my unit economics 12 months from now, and I can see overall where are we over, where are we under, where can we push. Because some regions I\'m okay with having poor unit economics because we just started, right? The Munich office, they\'ll have terrible unit economics for the first year. I\'m okay with that. But I have a portfolio view, and I can make sure it happens. And once it happens, sometime later this half, I will start aggregating all of these different regions, and strategies, and then I\'ll be like, oh okay, I\'m way over. And this always happens. This always always happens. Everybody wants 50 heads, and then basically we have to iterate them. Then we\'d go back, and we prioritize, and we say, Hey, this is the unit economics we need to hit. We are this over. And so let\'s stack rank our priorities, and then we\'ll cut it. Right? So maybe we\'ll cut an office here, or maybe we\'ll cut some resources over here, that may impact top line. And so we just iterate and you go through a couple cycles. Naber:\xa0 Wow. That is a great comprehensive, step by step answer. Nice moves, OJ. Thank you for that. All right, so we\'ve gone to your phases that you went through at Dropbox. I\'ve got one more major topic to cover, and it\'s a good segue, after you talk about Asana. So, why make the move to Asana? And tell us what you\'re up to there, up through now. And then, I\'ve got one final topic to talk about. It\'s a bit meaty, but it\'s a good one. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Okay. Hmm. Exciting. Cliffhanger. Asana\'s easy, right? I mean, I told you my criteria already, so, I made the call that this space is gonna blow up. It\'s going to explode. It\'s going to be huge. It\'s going to attract a lot of competitors. It\'s going to track a lot of interest. And I don\'t still know exactly what the category is being called. I mean, Forrester is now calling it collaborative work management. 451 is calling it enterprise work management. Gartner keeps cold calling us, I\'m not sure where...but there is heat. I think that the technology is differentiated for many ways. I love the product. Our users love the product. And then the team, ultimately, the team. I\'ve never worked with a team that is as committed to co-creation as Asana. And just great culture, starts from the top. Our founders really care about how we work, as important as the product itself, and the market. And so I feel we are going to be tested in battle, and we will win in the battle. So that\'s the short version of why Asana, and I feel very strongly about all three of those dimensions. Naber:\xa0 No, go ahead. So, then let\'s talk about what you\'re responsible for there, and maybe one or two minutes and then, I\'ll hop in. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Okay. So I run our Sales teams our BD practice. So on the Sales side, we have three lines of business. We have a big self-serve business. This is not what you think about traditionally when you think about Sales. This is a lot of working with product and Marketing to make sure your conversion funnel is really strong. Those of this as like Netflix. Netflix knowing which movies to pump in front of your face, so you buy them. Or Amazon, right? So a lot of this is Growth Marketing and Conversion Marketing. And that\'s a practice that is a strong one for Asana. We have another one called Online Sales, which is layers on top of self service, and this is high velocity Sales that takes advantage of our freemium model. And then we have enterprise Sales that is, more traditional. And their approach is really around driving big expansions in companies that we\'ve already landed. And BD, there\'s two components. There\'s a component around channel, which is how do we develop an ecosystem of revenue partners who can help us? And then strategic partners. So how do we partner and build alliances with folks like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Adobe, just kind of more software partners. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Okay. This is great. And you guys have just grown, it\'s a massive rocket ship, and you\'ve got enough cash, and you guys have all the right criteria for everything you mentioned earlier for how you\'re evaluating. Okay. And that\'s a great layout. So let\'s start with the topic, going from freemium to enterprise, and knowing when to do that, and we\'ll talk about how to do that. So you mentioned, and I was listening to a couple of your podcasts you\'d done in the past, and there was a really interesting structure you laid out about going from freemium to enterprise, and the steps you take in order to do that. One of the first steps you\'ve talked about in thinking about freemium was the right audience and the right product category. Can you explain those two concepts and how people should think about that? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Yeah. Most freemium products start this way. They come out of Y Combinator, something didn\'t work, and then it didn\'t work a week before demo day, they pivot, and they figure out something that works. They copy and paste in the Stripe snippet. They get everybody else in the same y Combinator class to buy, it\'s like this thing. And then then demo goes well, and everyone\'s like, wow, look at the LTV to CAC. It\'s amazing. Usually that\'s what happens, right. And it\'s a product-first view based on an insight of potential perceived pain. Now 8 out of 10 of these don\'t make it out of the gate. The pain is obviously not big enough to warrant more funding and such. But 2 out of 10 are great...I mean, these are smart, smart, smart founders, a lot of them. And they find a pain that that\'s actually pretty big, and they put it on the website. You can do a free trial, or you can download for free, it\'s pretty easy. And you start getting data on people that are starting to starting to sign up. And the word of mouth effect is something that is extremely...you have to have lived in Silicon Valley to understand what that means. And this is something that I think is different globally. But boy, technology that comes out of Silicon Valley, that word of mouth is effect is very strong. And so, if you got something, it will go viral pretty quickly, and you can start seeing people starting to sign up. And then usually it\'s for one particular pain that you think you\'re solving. But the reality is the market is going to find your solution actually solves a number of different kinds of problems that you don\'t even know about. And so this is where I think it\'s super interesting. Once you get to a certain scale, right? Let\'s say you get into single digit millions in ACV, or maybe in terms of customers, or let\'s say you get over a thousand customers...You have enough information now to just look across, and just do an analysis of, hey, what kinds of companies are these? It\'s going to two hours. Okay. Because a lot of these will be SMBs, and you can\'t just run data, and match, and stuff. But you can start inferring what types of companies are getting value from your product, and to solve what pain. That second part is very, very important. A lot of companies misse that. But if you\'re doing it in a freemium model, just looking at which company uses you doesn\'t tell you anything. Because usually it\'s a small team, solving a small pain, within a bigger company. So you\'ve got to pick up the phone, or you do a survey, and you understand. At some point you\'re like, okay, makes sense. I have some hypotheses on where I have great product market fit, and it\'s a big market, and I have a differentiator - to continue to double down on this pain, and do it in a differentiated way. Then I would start building, adding humans to the process. So the first piece I love is always Inbound Sales, or Inbound chat, or Inbound support, whatever. Basically get some humans in there to test your hypotheses, right? You\'ve got some data now...hey, maybe government is where the sweet spot is in solving this type of thing. Okay, great. So then higher one or two Inbound Sales people, and their job is to do a couple of things. One, for the companies that you\'ve identified to be in the middle of your bullseye, call them up, build a relationship, and you\'ll see that there\'s probably some good expansion opportunity right away. So again, because of the word of mouth dynamic should be pretty strong...If it\'s not strong, you gotta go back to the way, back to the whiteboard. If it is strong, you should be getting a reasonable amount of traffic on the website, right? It\'s not going to be thousands of leads every day, but maybe 10 a week and the the beginning, right? You want to man them, you want to take advantage of each one of them, validate your hypotheses. Obviously try to close the deal as well. But to me, revenue is secondary. And I do see this in a lot of management. They hire one Salesperson, and they\'re like, here\'s your quota. And that\'s, if that is your primary objective for that person, you\'re not gonna get the insights that you really want. And the insights are way more valuable. So your first couple of Sales people, I think you really drive the people to get you the insights. I\'m like, hey, where\'s the sweet spot? What pain are we solving? What are the additional pains that we could solve. That is more valuable than whatever, 20k MRR that you\'re going to get...So you do that and...mainly you take that feedback, work with product to really improve or expand the problem that you\'re solving and make it excellent. And then that should bring in more people, and more people. And then at some point you can start building out the team more, and then you start segmenting more, and eventually you can start going outbound. And outbound I\'ll put in quotes. What does outbound mean? Does it mean you\'re just traditional outbound...and Linkedn...and I mean, you are the expert here. This is like, okay, I\'m going to create opportunities. You figure out your persona, you know who you\'re targeting. You get them on the phone. People don\'t do phone anymore, people don\'t even do emails now. I don\'t even know, now people are sending books around. I don\'t know. But you find a way to get in there. You prospect. Yeah, that is traditional outbound. I think premium outbound, you\'d have something kind of in between, whereby you can go after companies that you already have some traction, and let\'s say they\'re healthier. Those are essentially your leads for an Enterprise play. And I\'m a big believer that if you can\'t even drive big expansion deals where you\'ve already landed, it could be a small land, but if you can\'t even drive some big expansion there, you\'ve got no business to go - let\'s call it true "outbound". So you know what, go outbound in accounts that you already have landed to some degree. And that motion, by the way, is not easy. You\'re at Nike, you\'re trying to get into Nike and you\'ve got 50 people, super fans love Asana, and they want to use it more, and they\'re really happy. And you\'re like, okay, well how do I navigate that organization? Right? It\'s hard. There\'s a craft. It\'s a different art and science to how you go about doing that. You\'ve got to get that motion down first. So that\'s the process that goes through my mind. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Awesome. And so let\'s say that you get to that phase, and you\'re going to start building out your Sales Engine. You\'re going to start building out your team of humans. What are the first few phases you go through and steps you take in order to do that? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 So the way I think about it is, you gotta first understand what are the selling motions that you want to build. And I think this depends company by company. But for me, now, there\'s a selling motion...it\'s not really selling with humans, but just growth optimizations, right? How does your website convert? That is a motion that you\'re gonna have to get good at. So I built a team around that. I have a team called Online Sales, which basically uses a lot data process automation to intelligently know which are the teams that likely came in through a self-serve funnel, that have a high propensity to close or expand. That\'s another selling motion that\'s very different. We talked about that Enterprise expansion play. How do you go after companies where you\'ve already landed and then you want to expand? That\'s another motion. So, I think depending on the company, this is I think more first principles, right? You\'ve got to understand what are the motions that you really, really need to develop. And you basically organize and start developing these teams to start building out those practices. And then as you do that, you can sort of reallocate resources depending on which ones are doing better and not. But I think the critical piece here is you need to be able to articulate and identify what is the motion that you want to build. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Good one. Last last one, and then we\'ll wrap. You\'ve been so generous with your time. I really appreciate it, OJ. Thank you. Now you just talked a little bit about your org and how you structure it, and you kinda just went through a few different motions that almost map, very closely, to the same org that you were just talking about. So within each one of the Self Serve, Online Sales, Enterprise Sales, BD, and Strategic Partnerships, can you give us one or two things you absolutely have to nail, or one or two best practices you absolutely have to think about if you\'re going to nail each one of those? Maybe we could start with Self Serve first. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 Sure. Self-Serve number one thing, you\'ve got to get cross-functional alignment. You talked to many, many growth teams, this is what where it falls behind. This goes back to my earlier comment about, you got to find a team that actually works as a team. Because that Self Serve business touches upstream, acquisitions...I mean, you can even go more upstream with branding. So brand, to acquisitions, to conversion funnel, to the actual adoption of a product in the first first 30 days. That\'s this Self-Serve business...and then eventually, and also retention. So it touches everything. And so if you don\'t have a cross functional alignment, you can forget about it. Literally forget about it. Don\'t even waste time because most companies are so small, where you really need the whole full funnel to work together, otherwise you\'re not going to move the needle. So that\'s number one in this Self-Serve business, you gotta get that alignment, you gotta get that commitment, and that\'s hard. So it\'s hard. Before you even build it, you\'ve got to spend a significant amount of time and energy to align with all the other functions around the company that Hey, do you all agree this is an important practice to build? And if so, this is how we\'re going to build it and how we\'re going to work together, otherwise not worth it. That is, Self Serve. Online Sales, so this is high velocity Inside Sales that sits on top of self service. A lot of this is depending on whether you have the systems, and operations, and data science to support that kind of velocity, right? On our Online Sales teams, each person closes above $1 million per person. That\'s a tremendous LTV to CAC, can\'t be that. Naber:\xa0 Whoa, I just gave that my stank face. Ooh, Whoa, that\'s really good. Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 It\'s real good, real good...and they\'re going after SMB and Mid-Market. You can only do that if you have really good automation, data science, that picks out which are the leads and contacts that you should invest your time in, and you get a bigger deal, right? Let\'s say each rep closes about 20 deals a month. So it\'s not a ton of deals. You\'ve got to really, really make them count to retire that money. And so making sure you have invested in the Ops, and the Systems, and the Tooling to make that efficiency work, is something that I think most companies underestimate. I continually underestimate it actually. I thought I\'m ahead of the game, and then a month later, I\'m like, ugh, I\'m still behind. So having that platform, thinking about the business as a platform, super important. Enterprise, for freemium businesses...I think the most important thing to tease out as a leader is understanding how much of the revenue is actually driven by the reps, versus how much revenue probably would have come in anyways. A lot of companies have the problem where the Enterprise reps essentially just piggy back, and put their name tied to an organic expansion, that likely would have happened anyways. So that\'s where I think people need to spend some time thinking about...Because that\'s not scalable. Naber:\xa0 Right. Alright. Business Development, Strategic Partnerships. You\'ve done this at multiple businesses and extremely well. What are some of the best practices when you\'re thinking about doing that? Oliver Jay (OJ):\xa0 So with the Partnerships, you got to ask what is your North Star? Are you trying to use Partnerships to drive awareness, which is much more around co-Marketing and branding. Are you trying to use Partnerships to drive leads? Are you trying to leverage a Partnership program to address product gaps to get into a new vertical? Are you trying to use Partnerships to just drive more user engagement? These are the questions that you got to answer first as a company get. Because I think where a lot of Partnership programs fail is, Partnerships go out and try to find Partnerships, and then eventually they bring it back into the company and people are like, there\'s no resourcing for it. Marketing doesn\'t want to support it, Product doesn\'t want to build it, because people aren\'t aligned on what you\'re trying to build. What are you going to solve for? And that\'s kinda the age old thing with Partnerships. Partnership folks generally want to do deals. But do those deals map and ladder up to a important initiative? If it\'s not a top initiative at a company don\'t even bother. And so I would say that\'s the most important thing when you think about Partnerships, of any kind, whether it\'s Channel, whether it\'s Strategic, same thing.

Naber: Ryan, awesome to have you on the show. How are you doing? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I\'m doing great. I\'m doing great. Thanks for having me. Brandon. Naber: I\'ve seen you with a beard without a beard and a lot of my research I\'ve been doing in the last few hours here. I like the beard and without the beard. It\'s very rare you can say that about someone you like it equally, and I typically lean towards beard by, I really like both. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 And now it\'s the grey beard. Now it\'s the grey beard. Naber: It\'s like, you go from all bald on the face to some salt and pepper, to a lot of salt, and then you\'re just, it sinks in. This is just a grey beard. This is just a great, love it. Love it. You and I have gotten to know each other personally over the last few months professionally as well, which is quite cool. I\'m happy that we get to, go through a lot of this, as content today with you. What I figured we could do is go through some personal stuff first. So start with Ryan Burke as a kid, what you\'re interested in. Then ultimately graduate into, pun intended, where are were in school with Baldwin the Eagle up in Boston, and then all the way through your professional jumps into your time at InVision. And in that time we\'ll just cover a bunch of superpowers as well as things that I know, people have said that you are very good at. And I know that you excel at given a lot of the places you\'ve worked, and roles that you\'ve had. Sound okay? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. Awesome. Awesome. Cool. Naber: So Westford, MA. What was it like for Ryan Burke as a kid? What were you like? What were you interested in? What were some of your hobbies? Let\'s go. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, definitely, definitely. So Westford is about 40 minutes northwest of Boston. Typical New England town with the centre of town, and the old church, and the common, and all of that. And it was great. Kind of prototypical New England childhood riding a bike around the neighbourhood and doing that whole thing. It was funny, my first job actually was, snake busters. So my buddies and I, when we were, I don\'t know, maybe 12, decided that we were going to rid the neighbourhood of snakes. So we would walk to people\'s houses, knock on the door, and charge a dollar a snake. It went well, it went well. It went well. We made all these crazy tools and t-shirts. We ended up just grabbing them with our hands, harmless garter snakes. But it went well until my mother came home one day and found a giant trashcan in the garage that had about 40 snakes in it. That was the end of, that was the end of snake busters. Naber: Did you call it snake busters? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Oh yeah, we did the tee shirts that we hand drew. I mean, it was right around, I mean, I\'m dating myself, but it was right around the Ghostbusters days. So, that was, that was my first commercial endeavour. Got me started in, got me started in Sales. But. Westford was great. I was kind of the athlete, whatever, captain of the basketball and soccer teams in high school, it was great. National Honor Society, I got kicked out my junior year, and came back in my Senior year and won the leadership award. So, it was a fun time and nothing but good things to say about Westford. I had a great childhood. I stay in touch with a lot of my friends still from Westford, pretty close to the community. And the Grey Ghosts, which was our mascot, which I still think is a great name, and I was the 200th graduating class of Westford academy. So it was public high school, but 200. Naber: So, one more question then we\'ll, we\'ll talk about your move up to BC. What did your parents do, when you were growing up? And what were some of the hobbies and interests you had outside of sports? Because obviously, you were quite athletic. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, definitely, definitely. So my dad was, that day and age was still the time of the long runs at companies. And so my dad was that a Digital Equipment Corporation. So he was at DEC for shoot, 30 years, I think, a long, long time. He ran manufacturing for a couple of plants there. My mom worked there as well for about 10 years. Naber: Is that how they met? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 No, they met outside of Hartford, Connecticut, in college. But my dad had a great run in Digital. My favourite thing was during his retirement ceremony, they renamed the big board room, the Bill Burke Board Room, and then they did a top 10 Bill Burke famous quotes. The number one quote for Bill Burke that I\'m not sure what it says about him for his 30 years. There was f*ck \'em. I mean it was celebrated, and it was a quote on a plaque, and all of that. But for 30 years that was interesting, and it kind of describes my dad, in a nutshell, a little bit. Naber: It\'s funny because people that know your dad if you gave him 10 guesses, they\'d probably guess it. People not knowing your dad, like myself, if you gave me a hundred guesses, that wouldn\'t have been it. I\'m so glad that that just happened. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So, and then the hobbies. Like it\'s interesting, you grew up in Massachusetts, but for whatever reason, my brother and I got really into fishing. And so, that\'s become a lifelong passion. I actually started and ran a fishing tournament for about 13 years on Cape Cod, kind of post-graduation. The Headhunt. The Harwich Headhunt. And yeah, it just became a passion, and I still fish all the time, and I\'ve gotten my kids involved, and all of that. But that was one of the things that my brother and I would sort of hike through the woods, and find little ponds, and build our little boats or whatever, and float out there, and catch bass and perch and whatever all day. And then we got the bug and started to get closer to the ocean and do some of the offshore fishing, which has been great. Naber: Wow. Very cool. All right, we\'re going to get into BC, but I have to go rogue on this one. If you\'re not heavy into fishing, what\'s the best part about fishing? Like, why do you love it? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. I mean honestly now that we get out offshore and go out on the ocean, you\'re just so in such a different environment and a different mindset, and really things just kind of melt away. And just from the stresses of the world being 10-15-20 miles offshore in that type of environment, we go to tuna fishing, there are whales jumping, whatever\'s going on, it\'s just a real escape. The phone\'s half the time don\'t work, and so, it\'s just...a lot of times we\'ll go out for an eight-hour fishing trip and my wife will say, well, you didn\'t catch anything. What the heck did you guys do out there? You\'re in this small confined space with like three other friends. She\'s like, what do you guys talk about the whole time out there, not catching fish. And so, it is a fairly intimate experience as well with your buddies, and there are beers involved, and all of that. Yeah, I just liked the whole like mindset change when you kind of get out on the boat, and you\'re heading out, like everything else sort of melts away the further you get offshore, and I really enjoy that. Naber: Wow, that\'s great. And from your sons perspective, as they\'re growing up, that\'s so cool that you\'re bringing them into your headspace and that world, to truly disconnect like that. That\'s really special. All right, you\'re away from the Ghosts, you\'re moving onto the Eagles - Baldwin The Eagle, your best friend. Why Boston College? And maybe a couple of minutes on what you were looking like in University. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yes. So, it\'s funny, BC was the only local school that I applied to. I really want to go to Duke, didn\'t get in. I almost went to Wake Forest. For whatever reason, I wanted to go and explore another part of the country, but I ended up, going to BC. Obviously great school, a lot of fun. And I\'ll say I\'m really happy with the decision based on what it was able to give back to my family. And so what happened at BC, the football games and the tailgates. And so my dad, my mom would get season tickets and they\'d come to every game. And they just developed a great relationship with all of my roommates and friends. Sometimes inappropriately with like, the conversations, they would hear were just crazy. And they get to meet other parents. And so over the four years, like my parents were really involved in my college experience. And for them to be honest writing the checks, like I felt like that was an opportunity for me to give them something back. And I always cherish that, bringing them into that experience. And we still talk about the glory days of the football games and beating another game Notre Dame, or whatever. So it was a great experience, and being in Boston was a lot of fun. Even most of the friends that I had at BC, were actually from outside of Boston. But yeah, BC was great. We were sort of in the heyday of sports when I was there too. We had some good runs, they\'re obviously terrible now. But I also, all things considered, I liked having a team. Me and my wife went to Holy Cross, and I kind of give her crap all the time because, it was great school as well, but like having a team and a brand that you can sort of follow. And I\'d still all way too close to I know every high school recruit that football team is right now and I read it every morning. And it\'s a little creepy, I know, but I\'m pretty involved. Naber: That\'s a job because they come from all the country to BC obviously. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 And I did it, I did it as a job a little bit. So I got so involved after graduation that I actually started writing for a BC website that was all focused on recruiting. And so I did that for about three years, just on the side for shits and giggles, and go to the game, sit in the press box, interview Matt Ryan after the game on the field, and all of that. And I was when I was still trying to figure out if I was going to get into the sports, as a career. But it was a lot, it was a lot of fun to do that. Naber: You know, it\'s really interesting. We\'re going to get into your professional jumps. That\'s a really good segue. But what I find when I\'m talking to a lot of these, a lot of folks in this podcast and a lot of the folks I really admire professionally with an entrepreneurial spirit, it comes out in so many different ways. And I actually don\'t think that the person talking about it really knows that it\'s coming out. So from snake busters all the way through to, like you have side hobbies you\'ve turned into like organized things that you do. Like, getting into BC sports, writing about it, making an organized effort and project around that. Same thing with fishing, 13 years of running that tournament. Like, taking your hobbies and turning them into something organized, structured so that everyone can enjoy and you\'re the driving force behind it with your effort because effort is the great equalizer within entrepreneurship. I think that that entrepreneurial spirit always comes out in people\'s hobbies, and I don\'t think that most of the people talking about it often think about it like that. But it\'s coming out in your hobbies right now. That\'s pretty cool. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. And if you want, I can do a quick sidebar into a hobby that turned into somebody that, did you hear about my book club? Naber: Oh, don\'t tell me, scorpion something. What is it? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Scorpions. New Speaker:\xa0 Scorpions. Yeah. Tell me about it. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Something I\'m proud of and something I will also say is potentially my biggest regret. But my wife was in publishing, and she\'d go to these book clubs and she would come home have a couple of glasses of wine and saying, Hey, did you talk about the book? Nah, we just sorta talked, and chatted, and drank wine. And I was like, you know what, this is a bunch of BS. I\'m going to go and I\'m going to start a book club to spite your book clubs, and just show you that I can build a better book club than any of the book clubs you\'ve been a part of. And she\'s yeah, yeah, whatever. And so I was all right, I\'m going to call it the scorpions. I came up with a tagline that was "Read. Bleed.", and it was all sort of tongue in cheek. So in Boston, it was like the all hard guy book club. And so I got about seven or eight of my friends who were smart, a bunch of entrepreneurial folks as well, a few guys that have been CEOs and sold companies. And we all read. And so what we did was we would go to places like dog racetracks, or shooting ranges, but we would actually talk about the book. So we would actually talk about the book. We would do trivia about the book. And then we would typically end it with a physical challenge to see who could pick the next book. And so what happened was one of the guys that was in the book club worked with my wife in publishing, and he released a press release. Because my whole point was I\'m going to create the Anti- Oprah Book Club. I\'m going to create, where a woman can walk into a store and know exactly what book she should be buying her husband, boyfriend, or whatever with a scorpion stamp. And so we read a book, and then we released a press release just for fun and games. Scorpions select, I don\'t remember what the first book was. Scorpions select this book as their official monthly book club, Dah, Dah, Dah. And we did it a couple of times, and the next thing you know it starts getting picked up. And I get a call one day from The New Yorker. And the New Yorker says, Hey, we want to do an interview with you. We do a feature on a book club every month. And we read about the all hard guy book club, the Scorpions. And we\'re like, all right. And so, called and interviewed me, Dah, Dah, Dah. And they put it on their website. Called back the next day. Hey, this has gotten so, so many hits. We want to go front page tomorrow. we need more pictures. I\'m like, I don\'t have any pictures. Like literally get up that morning with my wife, take my shirt off, put up World War Z, which we\'re reading the time up in front of me with a bottle of Jack Daniels, and she snaps a picture on her iPhone. And that next thing you know, that\'s on the front page of TheNewYorker.com next day. And so then it gets picked up, and Gawker picks it up, we had these magazines reaching out. And what happened was it snowballed very quickly where authors, I mean agents were calling me and saying, Hey, we want you to review our author\'s book. We want you to give it the scorpion seal. We made like a seal and all this stuff. And we\'re what is going on here? And we had people calling us from all over the country. Can we start a scorpions thing? A reality TV show reached out to us. My buddy called me at one point, my roommate from college, and he\'s like Hey, what did you start some stupid book club? I\'m like yeah, the scorpions. He\'s like well I\'m reading the 50th-anniversary edition of Playboy, and you guys are in here. And I was what? And so we picked up playboy and we\'re in there. So we almost got a book deal. We almost got a TV deal. And the whole thing sort of faded. It was at that stage, we\'re all just having kids. A couple of guys were going to sell their company, and so we really give it the attention. But finally I was able to go back to my wife and say, listen, I proved you wrong, I started a better book club. And now there\'s talk of bringing it back because I still think there\'s actually an opportunity in the marketplace for that sort of Anti- Oprah Book Club. And we actually read good, compelling books. And so that was my tie into the hobby question. Naber: You know, it\'s funny. One of the reasons I love doing the personal side before we jump into all this other stuff is, before you reach out to somebody, before you first have conversations and when you just look up on the pedestal of this person at this company with this title, and your background, your experience, I think it\'s quite intimidating before you start having conversations and humanize the experience. And that\'s one of the things I love about, about this section. But that\'s a perfect example. If you\'re hey, quick sidebar, I want to tell you about something and the entire Scorpion\'s book club, love it. It\'s great. So cool. All right. So that is, that is not a segue, but I\'m going to create one, into, you\'re leaving Boston College. And so Scorpions Book Club, the best thing you ever did, but we\'ll talk about some of the second and third best things you ever did after, after that. You\'re leaving BC, and run us through your professional experiences, up through the end of when you\'re at Compete so we can jump into InVision. So just run us through, the companies you were at, and the roles that you\'re in, maybe like five to seven minutes so we can, we can get some detail on there as well. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, definitely. Definitely. The first job I had out of college...I still get amazed at the jobs and internships that today...I\'m really impressed. Like back in my day, it was kind of like, all right, we\'re going to travel to Europe, we\'re going to screw around after graduation, whatever. And so when I was midway through my Senior year in college, a buddy called me - this is 1996 the Olympics in Atlanta - and he said, hey, I work for a staffing company, Randstad, I\'ve gotta hire like 20,000 people. Do you want to come work for the Atlanta Olympics for the summer? And I was sure, I got nothing going on. And I became known as the kid on campus that, like, I\'d walk into any party and be like, hey Burke, I heard you can give me a job with the Olympics. And I\'m like, yeah. So people giving me their resumes to work at the Olympics. So I think I got 40 kids from BC jobs at the Olympics. So we all went down there, and we all rented condos in the same little complex. And this was back in the Buckhead days of Atlanta too, the bars were open till five the morning before Ray Lewis ruined it. So worked for the Olympics. Great experience. I ended up staying there for a year, working for the Olympic Committee for a year. And it was just a really, it was a really cool experience. And then randomly, again, I was still trying to figure things out, and I had a buddy call and say, hey, you want to move to San Francisco? And I said, yeah. And jumped in the car, and we moved to San Francisco and slept on a floor for six months, and tried to figure it out. Did some temp things, and then I ended up getting into finance. So I got into a small kind of Muni Bond Equity House, which was, which was really cool. It was a really small, company. I touched so many different parts of the business. from the trading to the operational side and it was good. Series 7, Series 63 the whole deal. And then I use that as a springboard to get into Goldman Sachs. Worked in the private client services group in San Francisco, with Goldman. This was sort of during the heyday too. So, managing some of the early Amazon folks back in the day, and making some of those trades. I was what am I doing wrong? So it was great, and I had a good experience at, Goldman. And then it just, I got to the point where there were some family pulls back to the East Coast and at the same time I was at that stage where I was, on a pretty good trajectory in finance, but it was just something about finance that wasn\'t really getting my juices flowing. And I just knew. I mean just the culture of it. It very, obviously, money-oriented, and people are doing very well. And I just don\'t know, it just wasn\'t for me. And so I knew, okay, if I didn\'t get out then like I was just going to double down, sell my soul, and do the finance thing. And so I pulled the plug. I found a job back East at a tech consulting company. So this is the tail end of sort of the internet boom, and I got into a company called Mainspring, which was really interesting. It was a really smart group of folks from BCG, and McKinsey, and Bain that basically wanted to create a digital strategy consulting firm. And this is just at the time when all these companies are trying to figure out a digital strategy, nobody knew what it meant. And it was also interesting, in that they had a Sales function. So I joined as an Inside Salesperson, which was, your typical cold calling bullpen environment, and weird because you\'re dialling for dollars for high-end strategy consulting. And it actually differentiated us in the market a little bit, but I really cut my teeth in Inside Sales there, and just opening doors, and prospecting, overcoming objections. I really liked it. Mainspring actually had a pretty good run for a little while. We ended up going public. And then, the market sort of tanked. And then IBM ended up acquiring Mainspring. And so, it ended up working out in that, it was kind of offered a package. I could have stayed at IBM. It was another one of those decisions where similar to financial services, it was all right, I can take a job with IBM, but do I want to do that long-term at this stage of my career when I knew I wanted to be in something smaller and entrepreneurial. And I liked the small team environment, even at Mainstream when I started it was only 100 people or whatever it was. And that\'s when I got into Compete. Naber: You spent 11 years there. There\'s a lot of learnings here. So if you want to take your time and go through the next few minutes to talk about some of the things you learned as you\'re jumping through each individual step that you had, that\'s all right because that\'s probably helpful. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, definitely, definitely. And so Compete was interesting because that was back in the incubator model days. So basically Compete was an incubated business. David Cancel, who\'s the CEO of Drift, was kind of the first employee founder there. And I journal joined early on. It was basically, we had a web-based panel that we aggregated data and sold back competitive intelligence to companies. So, Hey, my website traffic is this, how does this compare to my peers? My conversion rate is x on my site, how does that compare? And you know, there were some dark days early on. There was your typical start-up, really young management team, screaming matches in the glass-encased conference room that was like raised four feet above, so everybody could see it, you know. And there were a few turnovers of Senior Leadership early on. A few turnovers of the entire Sales team that I survived twice early days. And we did that for the first probably two to three years. I was kind of the top Salesperson. And worked with some really smart people. And again, that entrepreneurial environment that I like, we had trouble figuring it out. And then for us at that point, the inflexion point was really when we decided to go vertical. And obviously not something that I think every business needs to necessarily do, but from a competitive standpoint...I helped found a kind of the wireless practice, and this was back in the Nextel, Singular, AT&T days, and they were all so hyper-competitive. And so we had this really rich data set to show like, how much online traffic are each one of these sides getting. What is their conversion rate to get people to sign up for bill pay? What was their conversion rate for e-commerce? And really valuable data. And so we built some dashboards, we layered on a consulting component on top of that. And it was really, it was really interesting. And that started what was a pretty big catalyst. Wireless became the biggest vertical at the company. I sold the biggest deal with Sprint, which is $500k, when our ASP was like $30k. And it was interesting in the fact that as a Salesperson, what kept me there as well, is when I started that vertical, I was able to position myself as more than just a Salesperson. And I became a wireless expert. And I would go speak at conferences, I would write white papers because that always gave me the credibility when I wanted to go and sit in a room with Senior folks. I mean we would do crazy stuff like I had business cards made, different business cards for like the big wireless conferences, the CTIA\'s or even the CES\'s, and I\'d get invited as press because I would write white papers, and so they would put me in as pressed. So like here I go to these things I get to sit down for 10 minutes with the CMO of Verizon and the CTO of AT&T to do briefings. And inevitably you share some data. And the other thing that we did at the time was we partnered with Bear Stearns, who was a big analyst in the Wireless space. And we created this really nice white paper that they distributed - a glossy cover, Bear Stearns, and it was all our data. And free data for Bear Sterns, whatever. But that became a little bit of every meeting we would walk into that was on somebody\'s desk. And so it was very easy to point to that and say, oh, that\'s our data in there. And they\'re like, oh really? We didn\'t know that. Tell us what you did. And so, building a brand beyond just being a Salesperson was really valuable to me from a career perspective. And partnering with somebody like Bear Stearns at the time was really powerful in the space from a wireless analyst perspective. And using that as a vehicle for content was just so big in building our brand at the time. And so, that was the kind of the earlier part of my career at Compete. And there are always times that thought about leaving, but every time it was sort of thinking about it, there was a new opportunity that would arise. And so then I moved into more kind of Sales leadership, and that was a new challenge. And building out sort of an Inside Sales and an Enterprise Sales team. Then `we were required. So the company was acquired by TNS, a big research firm. And then six months later by WPP, so essentially acquired by WPP, became part of that world. And that opened up a whole new world of opportunity and challenges, and that kind of put me into a new role. And then I became Head of Global Sales, SVP of Sales, across Compete. And that was within sort of the WPP, umbrella organization. So that was fun. So yeah, I was there a long time but worked with some really sharp people. My old boss Scott Earnst, I sort of followed him up as well, and he became CEO, and one of my mentors to this day. And so it was a really interesting ride. Definitely a really interesting ride. Naber: Very cool. And that brings, does that bring us to your jump into InVision at this point? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I did have a quick move, between there, I went to a company called Moontoast. Naber: Oh, that\'s right. Yeah, Moontoast. So, hey, before you do that, I want to talk about, you mentioned managing Enterprise and Inside Sales Teams. You\'ve done this at three different organizations if not more if you\'ve done some advisory work on this. But you\'ve done Inside and Enterprise Sales at the same time. A lot of the people listening will either start a business, have started businesses, will be the VP of Sales, VP of marketing, whatever. And they\'ll either inherit Inside Sales or inherit Enterprise Sales. And usually, they kind of tack one onto the other or they graduate from Inside Sales Leader into Enterprise Sales. You\'ve managed both at three different businesses. Let\'s talk about that for a few minutes here. What are the main best practices or tips that you have in managing Inside Sales as a contrast to managing Enterprise Sales? And we\'ll get into the top tips and best practices for that, but Inside Sales first. Inside Sales, what are the biggest differences between managing Enterprise and Inside Sales teams? When you\'re talking about Inside Sales, what are the best practices and tips for doing that? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, that\'s a good question. And I think the end of the day it\'s still, Inside Sales is obviously a lot more transactional and so it\'s a lot more around kind of that process. And Enterprises is around the process as well, but obviously very different motion, trajectory, timing, all of that. And so, with Inside Sales I would say one thing that\'s probably most important is figuring out what that customer journey is upfront, and really defining that path, and finding those friction points, and then building a process around what are the activities and behaviors that..like to me, everything kind of boils down to behaviors and activities when it comes to Sales. And that\'s relatable to Inside and Enterprise. And so performance in numbers is one thing, but you just need to figure out what the right activities are for Inside Sales. So break apart that funnel, figure out what those metrics are, and then really measure on those activity metrics. And that\'s been probably the most important thing. The other thing is, even when I started at InVision, we\'ll talk about it, making sure you have the operational infrastructure to define that for Inside Sales, whether it\'s hiring an operations person, like to me, you can never hire operations too early. I probably waited, I probably waited too long at InVision, and getting that in there early for Inside Sales, and building out, we even call them the leading indicators of what will drive you to a particular transaction. And so I think those behaviours and activities are incredibly important for Inside Sales. And then you just have to evolve it for Enterprise because that\'s a different motion, different ASP, whatever it is. And so same concept around leading indicators, behaviours and activities, it\'s just a different framework. And the hardest part is obviously, you sort of view Inside Sales as a stepping stone to Enterprise. And that\'s not really the case from a mindset standpoint. And that\'s, you almost have to break bad habits and rebuild them because the Inside Sales folks, currently really good at transactional, driving acquisition, boom, boom, boom. And then you move into Enterprise, you\'re like, whoa, slow down, let\'s talk. Now we\'re value selling, where before it\'s much more of a product sell. Inside Sales is much more of a product sell. Enterprise Sales is a value sell. And that\'s a big transition from a mindset standpoint where, step back, make sure you\'re asking these questions, figuring out obvious things like pain or whatever it is. And again, when we promote Inside Salespeople, sometimes there\'s that period where the onboarding for Enterprise is just as important as when you\'re onboarding them as a new employee for Inside Sales because it\'s a totally new framework and mindset. And if you\'re using the methodology like MEDDIC or Sandler or whatever it is, you\'ve got to kind of break them down and rebuild them again. Naber: Yup. Yup. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. So moving from Compete to Moontoast, let\'s hop into why you moved to Moontoast, and then give us a summary of that, and then we\'ll hop into InVision and I\'ve got a few questions on some of the superpowers that you have, some of the things you\'ve done really well, and a couple that InVision has as well. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. And so Moontoast was a social advertising, kind of rich media, social advertising - rich media within the Facebook feed predominantly, or any social feed. Part of it was at the time I was looking to get out of Compete. Moontoast came along, social was obviously very sexy, they just raised some money. Kind of wanted an opportunity to go in and be the guy from day one, and build it up. And you know, everybody\'s got a miss on their resume, and this was a miss. I came in, and we had some good momentum, really enjoyed the product team and sort of the position we had in the market. But we also existed within the Facebook ecosystem, which I don\'t care what you say, they just own everything. It\'s really hard to do exist. They make one change in their technology and like 20 companies go out of business. So I built a really strong team. I\'ve hired my top guy from Compete, brought him over. Hired some really good Salespeople, a few who I\'ve actually taken to InVision. But the product, we had to re-pivot product, and we ultimately had to re-platform it to try to fill the gap with services while we got the platform, then Facebook changes. We missed it. We just missed the window and things got a little ugly. It was one of those startup things where it was a little messy. And so I ended up leaving. I ended up just saying, you know what, and Moontoast not seeing their Future, we\'ll leave it at that. But I left. It was a good learning experience, met some really good people there. Social space was interesting, I\'ll never go back. Then I left there and then that was when I had the opportunity at InVision. And I can tell you kind of how that\'s how that started as well. Naber: Yeah. So this is good. So people are gonna want to hear the story. You joined really early. You\'re employee number 35, I believe at InVision, you\'ve got upwards of almost if not above, around the thousand employees or so, shed load of them remote if not all of them remote. Exactly, all of them remote. Like the largest, that I know of, tech workforce in the entire world that is remote - it\'s unbelievable. So, tell us about the story. Run us through the journey that you\'ve been on so far, and then I\'ve got a question around building your Sales teams from one to 50 that we\'ll cover, after you kind of tell us what the journey is up until now. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sure, sure. And so the quick story of how I ended up at InVision was, I quit Moontoast so I was out of a job. I was in sort of this panic mode and got some opportunities right away. And I was I don\'t want to act, move too quick. And then, just really stressful at that time in life, couple kids, like the whole deal. I was like, what am I doing? And was really close, I had paper in hand to an offer as the CRO of another company in Boston. Ended up being out on a boat with a few folks for my old boss, Scott Earnst, goodbye from Compete, and was sitting with Dave Cancel, we\'re having a beer on this boat, and tell them about my situation. Naber: I\'ve heard so many good things about Dave, by the way. So many good things through the grapevine. I\'ll meet him sooner than later. But as far as he\'s such a good guy. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, he is. And just sitting on the boat, and he was like, Hey, don\'t sign that paper. I was like, why? He\'s like, you need to talk to Clark at InVision. And I was I don\'t know anything about InVision. And he\'s like, design prototyping software. I\'m like, I don\'t know anything about it. Just talk to him. So I didn\'t sign the paper. We had a couple of conversations, he introduced me to Clark the next day. Had a couple of conversations with Clark, Clark Valberg, the Founder & CEO of InVision, who is just an incredibly interesting, inspiring person. And so the way it went down was, it was like a Wednesday night at probably 9:00 PM in Boston. And Clark, who was in New York, calls me and he\'s like, alright, I want you to come down tomorrow and meet with the board and meet with me. I\'m like, alright, what time? He said, eight o\'clock tomorrow morning in New York. And it\'s like nine o\'clock at night in Boston. I\'m alright, I\'ll make it work. And so I go down there, meet with a board member. Clark comes in, and I\'ve never him met in person or anything, and he just sits down and he said, all right, I\'m going to spend the next two hours convincing you that this is the wrong job for you. I\'m like, interesting. And so we ended up having about a four-hour session on design space, and how Enterprise might not work for design, all of these things. I remember at one point he was like, oh wait, when is your flight? I was well, I missed, it was like an hour ago. He\'s like, why didn\'t you tell me? And I was like, well, I want the job, this is super interesting. And so it was great. So we hit it off. Quick background, InVision before me had two VP\'s of Sales - one lasted a week, one lasted a month. And so I was pretty intimidated, and they were clearly a rocket ship. Even from the early days, you could just see the momentum. And that transactional business, like I had done some the Inside Sales stuff, but like not to that scale before, and build on it from a freemium model. So it was a pretty big leap for both sides and forever grateful for, for Clark taking the chance. And obviously it\'s been a successful path so far, and a lot of fun. But that\'s kind of how the whole thing kinda started, which was interesting. Naber: Great. Great Story. And so tell us, tell us about how many people were there when you got there. Like, what the Sales team can seem consisted of, which I\'m pretty sure was like two people plus you. And then give us maybe a couple of stats on where you are right now as a company, so we can understand that growth trajectory. And then I\'ll hop into how you did a lot of those things. Okay? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, definitely. Definitely. So when I joined those 35 people, I think there were three people on the Sales team, that I inherited. And the Enterprise business really didn\'t exist at that point. It was kind of formally launched a few months beforehand, but really there wasn\'t, there wasn\'t much revenue there. But what we were doing is we were getting about a thousand people signing up for the product every day to the free service or the self serve plan .So just incredible product-market alignment, and that momentum, and those signals for the business. And so I came on, now we are about 900 employees globally. We work with 100% of the fortune 100. We are fully remote. Raised $350 million total. So it\'s been, it\'s been a ride, that\'s for sure. And it\'s been a lot of fun. Naber: Man. Unbelievable. You\'ve got almost a $2 billion valuation on that $350 raised. You\'ve been there for about five years now. Is that right? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yup. Naber: Wow. Amazing. First of all, congratulations on all the success you guys have had. I just think it\'s an iconic company, an iconic story. And I think you guys are can\'t miss, can\'t lose, badass product company who is, building so fast, doing it the right way, which is great...From the outside looking in, and that\'s even before you and I started having conversations, I\'m so impressed. So let\'s talk about a couple of things. One, you have, you talk a little bit, in the past around building your Sales Team from one to 50. And you talk about it using the story of InVision, so let\'s use that story. But you talk about, building your Sales team from one to 50, you got to think about the three F\'s - the First Five, the Foundation, and the Future. Let\'s walk through each one of those bullets if you don\'t mind. Why don\'t we talk about the First Five, first? Actually, you know what, if you want to tee this up at all, that\'s fine. But I want to hear about the three F\'s for building your Sales team from one to 50 because it\'s an excellent framework. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. And so, the way I was thinking about it when I kind of looked back and break it apart is really, figuring out the right people for each stage. Because it evolves and it changes. And then the customer journey changes as you mature, and the deals get bigger, and you move more into the Enterprise. And so you kind of have to chunk it up and hire the right people at each stage, address the customer life cycle at each stage, remove friction points. And so, the biggest thing for me early on was getting the right people in the boat early. And fortunately for me, my first two hires, two Salespeople, that one is now a manager for me in Amsterdam, the other one\'s the top rep in the US, still here. Which is good because right before I took the job, Mark Roberge from HubSpot, a buddy of mine, called me and he was like, on speed dial who are your two best Salespeople? And I gave him these two names because I have a job. And they both got offers from HubSpot. And they both turned them down. And thankfully...Roberge was like, what the hell? I\'m like, I don\'t know man. And so then I got the job with InVision a month later, and it just worked out like, I called both of them, and I was like you guys are on the team, and it ended up working out really well. And I think, back to the First Five, I think some of the important traits for those folks early on is, they weren\'t necessarily just Salespeople. Like they were product managers almost at that stage and they just, they knew the product inside and out. And without having, proper Sales Engineer support, or any of that product support on calls, like it was a little bit of the wild west and we had to do our own thing. And InVision couldn\'t be further at that point, especially couldn\'t have been further from a Sales culture. Like it was a free product, free value to everybody, designers, it wasn\'t a push market, it was fully pull-motion, it was all bottoms up. And so we were definitely a little bit out there trying to figure it out. And so, hired these folks early on, that really could talk to the customer, understand their concerns, and their process, and their journey. And then ultimately we built the Sales process around that. And the other key thing about those first people are, you\'ve got to get the people that are on the boat that want to join a company at that stage for the right reasons. If you want to make a lot of money as a Salesperson startup, like InVision at that stage and start, that\'s not the right place. It\'s just not, go work at Salesforce. And so, you need to find people that are there because of the opportunity. They want the career opportunity. They want to be co-owners and building something. And that\'s what the early folks on the sales team, I actually think to this day we still hire people with those profiles...with the trajectory of InVision, like it\'s still early. And um, that was really critical to find people that wanted to join for the right reasons and not just purely on the financial side. And so getting those builders in early, the ones that can have those product conversations, that was really important for us early on. Naber: Very cool. Yeah, I think in one of the talks that you do, you talk about focusing on key traits - resilience, adaptability and fighters; and then focusing on key motivations - opportunity, vision and ownership. Those six things I think are so important. Do you want to talk about that a little bit? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. And I would say resilience is probably the biggest one because, at any startup, you\'re gonna have so many challenges. And so, I mean, I\'ve even made some decisions where we\'ve hired people that have had really good runs at really big companies and their resumes are great, and you hire them to a place like InVision, and it doesn\'t work out, and they\'re not ready for it. We probably hired them at the wrong time, the people that are better off, like I even tell our recruiters like, go find people that had a big run at a company, at a really successful company. Then went to a startup that ran out of money or a startup that went out of business. And they\'ve gotten their nose bloodied, and they know what it feels like because your nose is going to get bloodied at a startup inevitably at some point. And so you need the people that can take the punches and be resilient and battle through that. Not only can do it, but want to do it. And some of the folks we hired, like they just didn\'t want to do it at that stage in their career. I don\'t blame them either. So, you just gotta figure out that profile and make sure that things like resilience that is so important for those early hires. Naber: Yeah, absolutely. And I think it\'s incumbent upon the person hiring them to help those Salespeople to make that decision. Like oftentimes you don\'t know that you need to go get your nose bloodied, or you need to go have a failure somewhere else after your first jump from an organization or you\'ve had a really good run or a long run. Like you have to go get that, that that failure, you have to go learn and have that learning experience. Like it is incumbent upon the person hiring those individuals to help those individuals realize whether or not it\'s the right time in their career to make the jump into that startup or not. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And so, yeah, that was really important early on. And then in, the only other thing was that I talked about is finding all of those friction points early. So, mapping out that customer journey and figuring out why aren\'t people buying your product. Is it the price? Did they not trust you? Not know who you are? They do not want to sign up for a longterm commitment? Is it particular features? Like, whatever it is, you\'ve got a map that out, and then start to figure out how do you remove each one of those and address each one of those. And that\'s really important early on. And that will evolve once you move into the Enterprise, you\'re gonna have different friction points and you have to readdress them. Security and things like that all start to come in a little bit more, overtly. But early on, like just why don\'t people have the product in their hands? And do everything you can to remove those friction points to get the product in their hands. Naber: Yeah. Awesome. So there\'s a couple of examples that you use and some of your past content. Like, if the price is a friction point, using free trials and freemium, you are getting the product into their hands with free trials. Seeing the product in action, doing group Demos. You talk about understanding how they use it, pre-populating the assets and pre-populating the product. Lack of trust in your brand, building customer testimonials. Longterm commitments to a product, offer an opt-out, just get them on board. And then lack of features, sharing the roadmap for the product team, from the product team, getting them involved with that journey, and setting them up, setting the customers up with the product team to help evolve that journey. And I thought the examples you used and the solutions to them, I think those are extremely valuable as you\'re thinking about each one as different friction points, both as you get started and sometimes you don\'t solve those problem points with those solutions that you just talked about until mid-stage, late-stage and building Sales teams. So sorry to kind of steal some of that thunder. But I thought you\'ve talked about this a bunch of times in the past and using those examples, I think that that\'s really valuable for people and it\'s just great content. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 You did your homework. You did your homework, Brandon. Naber: Hell yeah, brother. I\'m always doing my homework. It\'s all about the prep in my world. So that\'s First Five. Now let\'s talk about Foundation. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yup. Yeah. And so the Foundation is sort of when really want to start building out the process, and that\'s when, like I said before, like that\'s when it\'s really important to hire operations because you\'re going to start to build out those leading indicators that I talked about - what are those activities that you want to measure? Because again, at this stage it\'s less about the results. I know that the results are important, but you really need to figure out like all of the specific activities and that\'ll lead to potential success. You can start to understand like what are the points, even in the Sales process, that you need to, that you\'re struggling with. And these aren\'t, these aren\'t things that are meant to beat the team upon. There\'s always like this head trash, and people are like, ah, I don\'t you to measure how many meetings I have a week, and I don\'t want you to measure many prospecting calls I\'m doing, whatever. And it\'s like, that\'s not the point. The point is not to like manage you out if you\'re doing it. The point is to help identify the coaching opportunities for the managers to say, okay, you\'re not able to get people to respond to your emails. Like, let\'s go through those and evaluate. You\'re not getting enough meetings. Like, let\'s look at some of your other outreach. You\'re not converting meetings opportunities. Let\'s go through your talk track in those meetings. Their guidelines and they\'re really coaching opportunities is what they essentially are. Naber: Diagnostics. Exactly. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And so, building that Foundation. The other thing, for a specifically for a company like InVision early on, is, how do you offer value beyond the product? And I\'m really sort of incredibly lucky and proud of what we do at InVision because we offer so much more beyond the product. But that\'s really important early because to some extent you need to build the trust and the credibility with your customers when your product doesn\'t always fulfil every promise. And that buys you time, especially early on. That\'s really important. So even when the Sales team, I never want somebody to prospect and try to set up a meeting to just talking about the product, it\'s like, offer something of value - a piece of content, whatever it is, but like offer value to somebody all the time. And you can, there are opportunities to do that beyond on the product. I mean, just a quick, a quick thing. I mean, our CEO is a brilliant marketer. And one of the things that we did is we made a movie. And so, even when I first started, Clark was Hey, we\'re making a movie. I was like, what are you talking about? And he\'s like we\'re making a feature-length film on design. It\'s like, you\'re crazy. And we hired this production company out of New York and flew around the country, and we made a feature-length movie called design disruptors. And it was an intimate look at companies that were using product design to disrupt entire industries. Google, Airbnb, Netflix, all of these, all of these companies. And we made this awesome movie, and we weren\'t in it. InVision wasn\'t in it, but it was brought to you by InVision. And so what we did was, we did a world premiere in San Francisco, Castro Theater, red carpet, press, the whole deal, VIP dinner after. Then we did one in New York, and we did one in London, and they were huge. And then what happened was, we were like alright, we\'re going to release the movie. But then people started emailing us and saying, hey, how can we do a screening here? I want my executive team at Uber or NBC or at Salesforce to see this. And so we sort of weaponized. And we didn\'t release it to the public. And we said, all right, if you want to do a screening or at your community, you know, wherever, we will host it. And I think we\'ve probably done 500 screenings across the globe at this point. You name a company, we\'re doing...we\'re doing one next week in Europe with a company, and what an opportunity to one, reach out to somebody and say, Hey, we\'ve got this incredible story that will help your management team understand the value of a design-centric approach. It\'s super entertaining. Why don\'t we come on, have some drinks, get a couple of hundred people in the room, whatever it is. Sometimes we\'ll even do a panel, we\'ll get people and product leads. We\'ll do a panel discussion after the movie. And it\'s been such a great a vehicle for us. I mean, now we have a full, we have a whole film team now at InVision, we did a documentary with IBM or called The Loop on their process, celebrated and evangelize their process, which, sort of strengthened our relationship with IBM. But again, offered value to the community, which the movie then ultimately did. Like it was a free offering from us to the community. Here\'s some really good content, best practices, examples, in an entertaining format that we are going to deliver to you as part of what our brand represents. Now we\'ve got a new movie that we\'re releasing this fall. And it\'s been incredibly successful. It\'s just another example of how do you go ahead...And not everybody can make a movie, I get it. But although I\'ve seen some good copycats over the last six months or the last year, it\'s coming. It\'s getting out there. But, Clark Valberg, this is yours. Valberg this is yours. It was a really powerful vehicle for us. Naber: Nice. Very good. And so you talked about adding value beyond your product. You talked about focusing on behaviours and activities. You talked about some of the activities. And you talk about hiring your first layer of management. You talk about hiring coaches, and not managers. Can you explain a little bit about that? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, I just feel like early, early days you just, you need folks that are, they\'re not about coming in as a manager for title reasons. And you get people in there that are really good at coaching because that\'s what is so critical. Using those leading indicators, using those behaviours and activities, finding those opportunities to help coach the team. And that\'s why your first Sales Director, or whatever it might be, they\'ve gotta be a really good coach. Because it\'s gonna be all about the failures, and the misses early on, and the objections, there\'s going to be so many objections you\'re gonna face, whether it\'s product, price, competitors, whatever it is. Like you really need to figure out how do you coach the team on overcoming those. And so that\'s why it\'s really important from a profile perspective that you really dig in when you\'re interviewing in terms of, talk me through, talk me through an example of where you identified something with a rep, and coached them through it to an improvement. What was the result? Those types of things are really important when you\'re building that Foundational team. Naber: Nice. Awesome. Okay. So that\'s that\'s the First Five, then we just talked about Foundation. Now let\'s talk about Future. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, and the only other thing that I\'ll mention on the Foundation, now that you\'re kind of bringing up the topic, which is just one of the things that we did that was interesting at InVision, was it\'s so important to understand your customer and like everything about their customer. This evolves at every stage. And so, early on, like I hired one. And so I hired a designer onto our team instead of a Sales Engineer. I hired a designer, this person came on boards, still with the company, he\'s great, but just gave that credibility to the Sales team in terms of the day in the life of what a designer deals with. And could hop on calls and give us some credibility in terms of talking to designers, which is a very unique persona to sell to. They don\'t like to be sold to. They want to touch and feel the product, learn about it, and then use it, and if they like it they\'ll tell their friends about it. So, figuring out who your customer is and then hiring them was really important. The other thing that we do now, which is an interesting kind of nuance is around understanding the customer. We now have a program called delicious empathy. And every person at InVision anywhere, again, fully distributed company, we have people all over the world, and anybody at the company from Operations, to Sales, to Finance, has the ability to take a designer out to dinner once a month and expense it. And the only rule is you\'re not allowed to talk about InVision. And so it\'s just about, again, building those relationships, understanding the motivations, the personal motivations even of your customers. And that just feeds into everything that we believe in and do as a company. And so that\'s been another kind of interesting thing for us to do across the company to help people build empathy with our customers. Naber: Yeah. Yeah. It\'s great. You call it, I think you call it relentless focus on the customer. It\'s a pretty cool example. Delicious empathy. I love the Pun. Delicious, as in, take you out to dinner, that\'s good. I\'m not usually a laggard on the jokes, that was a good one. Le\'s talk about Future. so you talk about a Foundation for building the Future. Go ahead. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So the Future is, I feel like, at this point, this is where, you built the Foundational team, you\'ve got some infrastructure in place, you\'re moving into the Enterprise. Like this is when things will break. Like things are gonna start to break. And you\'ve got to kind of revisit the overall customer journey. You\'ve got to revisit the friction points as you move into the Enterprise, things like legal process, security, all of those are going to be new friction points that you\'re going to have to learn how to address. And this is also, in a lot of cases, this is also when you make that shift from a transactional product-focused sale to the value-based one. And that\'s when you\'ve got to hire a different profile of Salesperson at this stage. You\'ve got to have all your motion at this stage. And so, now is kind of when you\'re, when you\'re really selling, and you\'ve got to get people that are, again, stewards of your brand. Along all of this, your brand is so important these days that just, I think people sometimes underestimate the impact of hiring the wrong Salesperson on their brand. And like, you gotta think about is this somebody that you would want in a room with 15 of your prospects, your customers? Would the be someone you would want presenting at a community event on behalf of your brand? And if the answer is no, they\'re probably not the right person. Even if they\'re the best seller in the world because they are representative of your brand. And you\'ve got to create that value through your Salespeople and that represents the value that you want to project in your brand. That\'s really important. And the other part about this stage is you\'ve got to find people that are really good storytellers. And that\'s so important. Can they tell a story? Because at this point, people don\'t really care about your product. Like this is when the transition switches on the customer side as well. They don\'t care about your product. They care about what the promise of your product can deliver. They care about the results, they care about the examples of what other customers have done to drive tangible business value from the product. And so there\'s that shift, and this is where you don\'t need the product experts in the Sales team. And this is where you can introduce things like Sales Engineers, or Product Specialists, or whatever it is to fill some of those technical gaps. But this is where you need people that can actually tell that story and sell the dream of what your products and more importantly what your brand represents. And that\'s really important at this stage as you kind of build out the team. Naber: Nice. Okay, so I want to hop onto a different topic or anything else you want to talk about before we conclude on that? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 No, I think that\'s good. Naber: Okay, cool. I\'ve got two more topics I want to talk about and then we\'ll wrap. First one is, hiring, onboarding, and managing, remote Sales teams, and really remote workforces are what you guys have to manage as an entire business. But specifically hiring, onboarding and managing remote Sales teams. So there are a few different things that I\'d like to cover. I think there\'s five in total. First one is hiring profile and hiring execution. How do you search for the right person that is a great person to hire as a remote employee. What are some of the things you look for in making sure that they can do that? And then what\'s your execution process look like considering you\'re hiring people all over the world, you\'re not necessarily sourcing them in one city or one industry. You\'re looking for them all over the place. So what\'s the hiring profile and how do you execute on the hiring process? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, and I think we are the single largest fully remote company in the world now. It\'s a little crazy. There\'s definitely cracks at times and things. And just a little, a little bit of context. It started where our CEO wanted to hire the best engineering talent. So we started to hire folks in different places. Even when I started, he was like, Hey, if you want us to open up a Boston Sales office, you can. And I did the whole tour of real estate in Boston, and almost pulled the trigger, but then it just in part of our culture. And so we started to hire some people from all over, and you could kind of place people strategically in these maybe lower-tier markets, or whatever. And so it became really, really, valuable for us. And it\'s a big asset. On the hiring, you\'ve got to find people, not everybody is ready for it. The last person you want is the person that found you on a remote job site, and you ask them what they like about InVision, and they say, oh, I want to work from home. Like, they\'re out. You do need to find people that are proactive. Like you need to find people who seek help because sometimes it\'s hard, and you can get lost or and you can hide. And you\'ve got to find those folks that are very proactive in their approach and sort of ask questions around that in in the interview process. That\'s really important. But the biggest thing in one of the biggest lessons we have learned here is onboarding. Onboarding is so critical because it can be very intimidating your first day sitting there and not having anybody to talk to. And so we\'ve evolved our onboarding process, pretty dramatically over the last couple of years to, we kind of map out everybody\'s first 90 days now. And they need to know exactly who they\'re talking to, exactly what they should be focused on, exactly what the expectations are. And we can still improve that. But even from things like time management, like I think there are still opportunities for us to improve there, especially for some of the younger folks that come in. And they\'re living with four other buddies in San Francisco, or they\'re off on their own somewhere, wherever, and they get up in the morning like, how do I spend my day? And so we\'re getting a lot more prescriptive in terms of just even time management training. And what percentage of the time per week should they be focused on these types of things? What percentage of the times did we focus on these things? Even like learning and development. And so the onboarding process is something that it\'s just so critically important for a remote team, and there are still opportunities to improve, but I think we\'re doing a pretty good job now. Naber: Nice one. So you just talked about hiring profile and some of the things that you need to assess to make sure someone\'s ready for that. You\'ve talked about time management. And you also just talked about onboarding. Can you give the audience an understanding of like, how specifically prescriptive you\'re getting? When you say like your first 90 days you\'re mapping it out, without giving, you don\'t need to give all kinds of detail, but just like how prescriptive are you getting with the time management piece? Or like the first week? Or is it hourly? And what they should be doing each hour? Or is it a chronological cadence that they should be going through? Like, how does this work and how prescriptive you get? Because I would venture to say that you guys would have a best in class, worldwide onboarding program. So talking about this a little bit would be, I think, helpful. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sure. And yeah, I mean it\'s pretty prescriptive and very detailed. And the way it works is we\'ve got sort of a company-wide onboarding program. The first designer that I hired, he now developed and runs that whole program. That\'s all about, it\'s like the first day is just logistics and get everything set up from a technical standpoint. Being remote, we actually give everybody $500, when they start to set up their Home Office.And so we know it\'s not easy. If you need a monitor, you need a chair, whatever. We also, another small thing is we give everybody a card that has $100 per month for coffee shops. It works in any coffee shop. And so we know people are going to need to get out of the house and have some social interaction. They\'re gonna work at Starbucks or whatever. Early days, we used to have unlimited Starbucks cards when I started. Everybody had an unlimited Starbucks card, and it was awesome. But you can imagine Starbucks sell a lot of food. Things get a little crazy early on. So we had to ratchet that down pretty quickly. And so now we\'ve got limits on them. Starbucks cards, fun facts, Starbucks cards work at some grocery stores in San Francisco. And some of our BDR\'s found that out. So it was interesting. But enabling people for all of those things out of the gate. And then after you kind of move through the companywide onboarding, then it goes into the roles specific. And there\'s sort of different tracks around day in the life as a Salesperson, what you need to know. And then it\'s sort of product is really heavy for us as well upfront. How do you learn the product? And then content is really big for us. We have so much content, best practices, all of that. And so it\'s like along those tracks that we really invest, here\'s what you should be learning this day, here\'s who you should be meeting with on this topic. And like going through that. We also do a buddy system for the role. And so, you buddy up with somebody, they kind of check-in with you at the end of every day, and then you have check-ins with the head of onboarding as well, that does check-ins with that class to make sure everybody\'s on track. And yeah, it\'s been pretty, I mean, you basically detail out everything that you feel like somebody needs to know to be successful with their job, and then determine in order what they should be focused on, how deep they need to go, who the resources are that they should be reaching out to for it, and what the content is and just, basically given that as a resource. Naber: That\'s awesome. It\'s an ultra type-A exercise documenting all of that. And most of the time that gets lost as people leave the organizations as well, and that\'ll obviously never be lost for you. It\'s a retention exercise for content as well as headspace, and you won\'t have brain drain as much as well. So let\'s talk about, one more thing within that, which is, communication, and how that plays into the culture. So how do you sustain a culture, and what is it that you guys do for communications to proliferate that culture and keep it? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, it\'s interesting because like we\'ve talked in the past, like, so the communication and collaboration can be addressed through technology in a lot of ways in a remote environment. Like everybody, we\'re on Zoom, which we use. Slack we live in. And InVision we use obviously. And so those are kind of our primary communication vehicles obviously with email, and collaboration, and tools. Those are really important. But it\'s interesting, like, we\'ve almost got to the point where Slack kind of not breaks, but at our scale, you got to figure out when something should be an email where it\'s a little bit more trackable versus when it should go Slack. And so we\'re sort of revisiting that. But you really, in a remote environment, you got to double down on the culture. And you\'ve just got to really over-invest there. And we do a lot of things. One of the biggest things I would say is, really in any company I feel like instituting values is really important. And so how do you institute some core values that you want people to operate within. And that\'s how you should be hiring people based on those values, managing people based on those values, put them in the performance plans, put in their comp plans, all of that. And so what we do is we celebrate those values a lot. Like every meeting, we have a value award winner, and we celebrate the value. Or there are just little things like we have, there\'s a tool out there called Bonusly, which is really interesting. Basically, it\'s like a kind of like micro-rewards where we integrate into Slack with a Slack channel, and everybody at the company gets $30 or $50 per month that you have to spend. And so what happens is, I\'ll say, hey Brandon, this is a great podcast, boom, I\'ll shoot you $5. And everybody sees it. And you could throw on their two bucks or hey, you crushed that prospecting meeting, here\'s three bucks. And you can attribute it to a value, or hashtag a value, and it adds up and people see it. And so because we\'re remote, you don\'t get, a lot of those pats on the back, or shaking hands walk into meetings. So it\'s a really powerful and engaging way to just give those little quick hits of recognition that are again visible to everybody. And people make real money off of it. Like people are buying bikes, and Xboxes and stuff cause the money adds up, and then you can exchange it into a marketplace for things. Like those types of things are just really important in terms of celebrating. Because you have to learn to celebrate. I think one of the things in a fully remote company you do need to understand is like you kind of have to learn how to do everything remote. We can\'t say, all right, we\'re going to be remote, but we\'re going to get together every month and train in person and we\'ll do our celebration. Like you\'re going to have to learn how to train remote, you gotta celebrate remote, you gotta hire remote. Like everything, you gotta build that playbook. And it\'s not always easy, and there are still opportunities to get together and we do that. But for us, we get together more. We do one annual thing that we\'ve now done two years, which is great. Everybody\'s so enormously positive when you haven\'t seen somebody in person like it\'s such a love fest, and it\'s great. But we do, we overemphasize getting in front of our customers and our community and tying those...like, we over-invest in sending people to community events or customer events. And so you get to meet and talk to folks on the team, but you do that and kind of tie it to customer interactions as well. Naber: Wow, that\'s really cool. Man, that example - Bonusly - and putting that into Slack or your calm channels to give virtual pats on the back, plus you\'ve got the reward, and you\'ve got the recognition, and it\'s peer-driven, and you have 30 to 50 bucks and you have to spend it. I mean, that\'s both prescriptively tactical, thank you for that. And then also a great example of how to do, both in-person companies as well as fully remote companies, or somewhere in between. Like anyone can do that. Any Organization can do that. All right. Sorry, go ahead. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 No, I was gonna say it\'s funny, we do have a slack channel as a fully remote company that\'s called house swapping. So people go in there, and literally will just say, I\'ve got a place in Toronto, I\'m heading out for a tower for a month. Does anybody want my place? And somebody else will say, yeah, I got a place in London, who wants my flat for a week. And people trade houses. Or people go, we had a group of folks on my team that rented a house in the South of France for like a month. And like four or five people went and worked together. And it was just funny because I was like, uh oh, here we go. These guys are going to be whatever. And so I actually measured their productivity before and during their time in this house in the South of France, and their productivity was actually higher because I think when people understand that they have to earn the right for this remote benefit. And people take it very seriously. And so, I think we have that culture. We know like maybe this isn\'t for everybody, but for me personally, it\'s really rewarding to spend time with family or travel or whatever. And like you got to make sure that you\'re held accountable, and you\'re available, and you\'re earning the right every day to have that type of benefit. And I think that\'s pretty pervasive in the InVision culture, Naber: Man. That\'s great. Good examples too. Hey, we\'re going to wrap here. I\'ve got one more question, it\'s a rapid-fire question. And I asked this to every single guest, I explain to the audience each time that I usually ask this question on people\'s birthdays. Your birthday is in February, I believe, so I don\'t think it\'s now, which is August. So I\'m pretty sure it\'s not. What is the most important learning or lesson you\'ve acquired professionally in the last 12 months? Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Oh, in the last 12 months. Naber: Yeah. I put a time parameter around it. So you really have to think about recency. Ryan Burke:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. Interesting. I mean, the one thing I\'ll tie to this book that I\'ve been reading, The Power of Moments by Chip and Dan Heath is all about like how do you create these interesting and compelling moments. And whether it\'s personal, they talk about some examples of hotels and things like that. But from a workplace, like especially in a startup, you\'ve got to create those legends. Whether it\'s their first day of work and doing something interesting, or we held training in Amsterdam a couple of months ago, and I brought out like champagne, and we all toasted it and took this crazy picture. But it\'s like when we all leave here, you\'re going to look back at those moments. And so now when I go into our off-sites or whatever, and especially when you go through turbulent periods, like how do you figure out how to create these memorable things that everybody\'s gonna look back on when their InVision story is over and say, remember that? So I\'ve sort of started to bring that into things that we\'re doing, and think about it in the framework of how are we going to create something that is going to be a memorable, significant point in their InVision story? And how do we celebrate that and make it a point moving forward? Naber: Hey everybody, thanks so much for listening.

Here we go. Naber:\xa0 Double D, Dan Dackombe. Awesome to have you on the show. How are you this morning? Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I\'m well. I\'m well. Thanks, Brandon. Naber:\xa0 You\'ve got your go-to tee shirt on. You\'re ready to rock in the morning and had your cup o\'tea. I\'m loving it. Hey, what I think we\'ll do in our chat, go through some personal stuff first, and talk a little bit about you growing up. What Dan Dan was as a kid. And we\'ll go through some of the decisions you made as a kid, and what you were like. And then ultimately, go through the bulk of where we\'ll spend our time, which is professional stuff. Sound okay? Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sounds great. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. All right, let\'s start with Dan Dackombe as a kid. So Crawley, England, I could have said that horribly, with the American accent. Totally understand that. However, Crawley, England, believe you grew up there. What were you, what was Dan Dackombe like, as a kid? What were you interested in? And what were some of your hobbies and things that you were doing when you were younger? Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Oh, man. Yeah. So, I\'m the oldest of three. Two younger brothers. Yeah, my parents divorced when I was about 12, and they both started another family each. So there are five brothers all in all basically. Which is, which is pretty cool. So I\'m the oldest of five really. I was, I was pretty intense. My Dad was a rugby guy, so I played a lot of rugby growing up. So yeah, I\'m not great at the kind of default, what\'s your favourite football team? I kind of have to take a bit of a back step in terms of my credibility around anything regarding football, more of a rugby guy growing up. I boxed through it while I really enjoyed that for a few years. But yeah, I was a pretty social guy, pretty social kid. I was, I was always...and this is quite an interesting dynamic actually because I\'ve thought about a lot of these ideas. I was always the worst kid, in the top class. Okay, and so what that basically meant...And that has kind of scarred me and blessed me. Take sports. I remember being on again, my son\'s 14, so this is really like...I remember being 14, 15 in the cross country race. So you imagine a freezing cold, February morning in the UK, frost on the ground, and there being a big line of in my mind, giant 15-year-olds. And there\'d be like, me, and I always got smashed. So I\'d always be like, maybe not last in the top group, but I definitely went the champion jog. And so I was always frustrated that I\'d worked hard enough to get to the top group, but I was never kind of capable in that sense. And likewise, academically, I always found I did pretty well at school. I wasn\'t the most gifted, but I was always in top sets, but I wasn\'t one of these people that were crazy naturally gifted. I had to revise really hard. And so, I think a lot of that translates to both, I think what helps set me up for future success, but probably also like, it has caused a lot of the scarring and imposter syndrome that we all kind of face. Maybe it\'d be different if I was in the one class down and like, the top kid there. Yeah, it was great. I was, I enjoyed growing up with where I lived, had a whole bunch of friends I\'m still in touch with. Probably half a dozen of them. You don\'t see someone for a year, two years, three years, and then you catch up in a bar or pub and telling the same mom jokes, or talking about the time that someone did something stupid. And you know what man, we just been repeating these stories for like 30 years. It\'s nice to maintain those types of relationships. Naber:\xa0 Oh, that\'s great. That\'s good, that\'s a really good start. You got me smiling a lot over here. It\'s great. And you always do. Okay, so, two more questions. What was the first thing you did to make money? Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, I mean I\'ve always had a pretty good work ethic. And so I worked from a pretty young, I mean I did like, standard, paper rounds at a young age, gardening work. My first actual employment I worked, cleaning the cars on the four court, on early, early Saturday mornings. So that when people are out looking at new vehicles, they can go in and again the cars don\'t look like they\'re covered in crap. But this was a show that was right in the middle of an industrial estate, right next to this great big dual carriageway. So I used to come into work every Saturday when these cars were like rotten. I was like, I gotta clean every single one of these calls again. It used to kill me. I just think maybe like, I don\'t understand how they get so written off. So I did that probably 14 or so. But yeah, I spent a lot of time, doing construction jobs. My Dad was a construction guy, ran his own companies. I mean, you wouldn\'t do it now. I mean, I would probably be, yeah, my first salaried wage. I could have been maybe 15, maybe 16, and you\'d be working in a building site in central London. He\'d like dropped me off. I mean he dropped me deep in. And so talking about learning confidence. And building relationships with like, grown men who are kind of in the construction stage, and I\'m like 16. And my dad was the boss and no one knew this. So basically, I was the boss\'s son. He would drop me off, and at the end of the week. I\'d meet him in the pub, as you do when you\'re 16. And everyone would be like, Oh man, you know...I\'m like, that\'s my dad and all of these guys be like, oh man, we\'ve been bossing this kid around for a week, and this is the boss\'s son. I, I\'ve got a whole bunch of stories I can probably tell you in the pub about my time doing that sort of thing. But yeah. So I\'ve done some different jobs and worked from a pretty young age. Naber:\xa0 The things that folks have done when they were younger that they don\'t think are that fascinating, or just normal, are fascinating to a lot of other people. So you\'re saying that you worked for your dad\'s construction company, you just got dropped off and then picked up. That sounds a crazy, interesting scenario for many people that didn\'t have that as their normal day to day as they\'re growing up. So maybe it doesn\'t come to mind, for you or for the folks that are talking on this on our show a lot, but it\'s really fascinating. That\'s really cool. It probably, I mean it forms and shapes you. Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Totally, I mean I\'ve got a really vivid image in my mind. Bearing in mind this would probably be early to mid-nineties. So it wasn\'t quite deep in the eighties, but there was still that 80s hangover of music, what people wore. And so the work that we did was a lot of, like, data centres and dealing floors. And so basically just as the trading community began to really digitize their business, and they used to have big data centres basically, that\'s what my dad did. He built out trading floors and data centres. So all of my work would be in the city. Okay, so you\'d be all of these companies that had been doubling down on technology. And so I remember being in a bar in the city and there was like, two divides. I mean on one half of the bar you had all of these construction dudes, and on the other half, you just have all these traders. You know, handmade suits. And it was really interesting for me too because it was like, hey I\'m here, but it baked this aspirational, I want to be on the other side of the bar, and I want to be with the traders crowd. Those are the guys that are drinking bottles of champagne, and you know all of the builder guys were pretty dismissive about them. And I kind of was looking at them in a fairly, sort of aspirational way. Like yeah, at some point I\'m going to be, I\'m going to be that guy on the other side of the bar. Naber:\xa0 I love that. Cool. That obviously shaped your mentality for a long time. Great Story. All right. So, you\'re making decisions about where to, about where to go to school. You head over to University of Surrey, in Guildford. Explain, why you went to University of Surrey, and then we\'ll hop through some of your first professional, gigs and up through, up through TotalJobs to LinkedIn. Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, sure. I mean, I loved history and I loved...The A levels that I did, so I did English, I did history, and I did an early, what was called then, a media studies course. And in that media studies course, we studied a product and a principle called the information superhighway. Okay. And that was the first name of the Internet. So basically, I remember writing essays and stories and dissertations on potential outcomes and the impact that this would have in terms of like, they were really around personalization. I mean basically what we wrote about then, in terms of IoT and personalized content, seems so abstract because we didn\'t understand the hardware and the kind of infrastructure requirements, and that felt too advanced. If you can let go of the how you\'re going to make it happen, and kind of focus on the what, it becomes quite inspirational. So, so I did that. So I applied for two types of colleges. My number one choice was, nautical archaeology in North Wales. Okay. So my life could have been very different. Then the other piece, so the Surrey course was a BSc in media production and business. And so it was all in documentary making, filmmaking, radio shows, graphic design, web design and business around that. So a lot of my pals from college went on to do some sort of media production based job. And I, yeah, I mean, I loved it. It was great. It\'s a great course. It was really practical. I didn\'t really apply myself I think as well as I could\'ve done. I think I did the classic, straight from high school, did A levels that were pretty intense. Then straight from there went to college, and at that point, I was just like, I wasn\'t there with a purpose apart from kind of having fun really. Yeah. It was a, it was a great course. Made some great friends there. Still in touch with those guys. And yeah, really, really enjoyed my time there, but it was mainly focused around media production and business. Naber:\xa0 Nice one. Awesome. All right, so you\'re leaving Surrey, you\'re getting into your first gig out of school. Walk us through the first few gigs you had a school and take us up through the end of TotalJobs, and then we\'ll talk about your jump into LinkedIn. Because we\'ll spend the bulk of our time in LinkedIn and Mixpanel and talking about a few of your superpowers and going through some mindset and method on some of the things that I know that, one, you\'re really passionate about, and two, that you\'re really good at. Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So, I mean, I didn\'t know exactly what I wanted to do when I left college. The career track if you want to kind of continue some type of media production based job is that effectively you leave college and try to effectively get an apprenticeship or an internship. And I just was too impatient for that. And to be frank, I needed the money. And I couldn\'t wait around, in terms of what I wanted to do in my life, and where I wanted to go. And so, I struggled. The idea of kind of like, dragging myself up into central London, to work for some sort of media production - pre or post-production business - for almost minimal wage with a view that at the end of a period of time they may or may not offer you a job. I was like, man, I don\'t know if I\'ve kind of got that in me. And so I\'ll paint for you because it gives you a nice snapshot of the times. So I was in a pub smoking cigarettes. Back in the days when I used to smoke cigarettes and back in the days when you could smoke in a pub. I\'m reading the Guardian, which is a pretty left-wing paper, back in the days when I was fairly left-wing. And it had hundreds of pages of job adverts, and this is pre job board, so the technology of job-seeking was sitting in a pub looking at a newspaper, which kind of suited me quite well. And there was an advert in the back of this newspaper saying, are you a graduate? Do you earn 30,000 pounds a year? I was like, yeah, that\'s an easy take on those two. Circle. I\'ll go and grab another beer. And basically dragged myself up to London for an interview. I had a phone interview, go invited it up for a second interview, and walked into this place that was basically a massive contract publishing business. And they had like two hundred people, on this huge Salesfloor. There was a huge amount of energy. There\'s a huge amount of fun going on. I used to get paid weekly in cash, which was hilarious. It was just a real boiler room basically. And basically the end of that first year, I was the number one Salesperson. I\'d paid off my student loans, I\'d bought a car, and I\'d bought my first flat in my first year. And so basically, I used to get paid weekly in cash. I was living on my Dad\'s sofa at the time because I came out of college and I was like, I needed to get into London. My Dad worked in London. And I was like man, I\'ll just bunk up with you for some time. And that was it. The Sales bug, you\'re hit man as soon as you start moving into that world. So I did that for a couple of years, beginning of the .com boom. Headhunted for an Inside Sales role. Went over, joined that company, and that company went on and was rebranded to coming from Stepstone. And I stayed there for a number of years, moved into my first leadership role, managed a pretty big team there. So I moved on to managing probably 18 people. And then literally the DOTCOM bubble burst, share price completely tanked, we had to fire half the people. I kind of walked away from there being completely disillusioned with management and leadership because I just personally found it so hard. I left there, pretty bruised, to be honest, I\'d kind of gone through a pretty tough time prior to me leaving there. Had burn out periods, took a couple of months off. And in many ways that\'s actually one the best things that happened to me because that has really helped me sort of, mediate and moderate my own thinking around work. Mental health in the workplace is another topic that I\'d love to talk about. But maybe that\'s another, another topic for another time. Went over to TotalJobs, which was basically the digital division of RBI, a large publishing business owned by Reed Elsevier, a global FTSE business, Anglo-dutch company. Went to their digital division. Started off as a Field Sales guy. I\'d spent, up to that point, I\'d been an Inside Sales guy and Inside Sales Manager. Managed a team, then managed two teams, managed the channel team and the advertising agency and RPO team. So moved up the ranks there every period of time, had great fun. They\'re highly, highly competitive. Highly in the UK. So kind of learned a lot around just operating as effectively as you could against the backdrop of peak competition. And then really the big change for me at that point, I was then headhunted again by LinkedIn to basically be their first EMEA Enterprise Sales Manager. So I was responsible for and launched the UK business. And there\'s, there\'s a whole other chapter to follow on after that, I guess. Naber:\xa0 Excellent. So that\'s your jump into LinkedIn, first role at LinkedIn. So, let\'s pause there for a minute. You were at TotalJobs for eight years. I mean that\'s a long, long time. What were one or two things that were the biggest things that you learned that you took with you throughout your career from TotalJobs? And then we\'ll hop into your roles at LinkedIn and I\'ve got some specific questions around your superpowers there. Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, so I think, key lessons learned, there were one, around the importance of short term execution. This was a business that would operate with pretty strict deadlines. And so as opposed to the kind of annual quota philosophy, there was almost a monthly execution. And I think that created a good sense of kind of both urgency, and then how do you kind of manage a team to kind of operate so that there\'s like, twelve billings periods as opposed to one or even four. And so I would say that was definitely one of one of the key pieces. And then, actually the back end of my time there, the global credit crunch had really just started. And so actually it was a really, the year before I left, it was actually really quite tough. And basically we got to the point whereby if a bunch of headcount we\'d removed from the business. And we were down to right, this is the skeleton crew that we need to run. But if we don\'t hit the following financial milestones, further cuts will need to be made. And I was quite transparent about that with my teams. I was like, look, this is where we are with it. And so I guess out of that adversity came a belief around the importance of honesty, transparency, authenticity, and then how the team then galvanized. And basically, you would get to a point whereby at the end of every month or the end of every quarter people were working for each other, working for a particular cause. And I come on to this, but I\'ve always believed people work better for a cause than the company. And that cause for us at that time was like, we don\'t want to lose anyone from our team. And so, those were, I would say, the urgency of the billing, but then also the importance of galvanizing a team around a particular mission. Even if at that point that mission was pretty negative. But it still showed me the importance of relationships, and how to lead through adversity. And those, I would say probably the two things that really stand out. Naber:\xa0 That\'s great. Okay. So you jumped into LinkedIn, you\'re headhunted into LinkedIn. You\'ve talked about what you\'re responsible for in your first role, so jump through maybe in two minutes, the responsibilities you had in that first role again, and then through your jump from Mixpanel and just run us through what you\'re doing at LinkedIn and what you\'re responsible for. And then we can jump into a couple of topics. Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, sure. Okay. So, I mean, there were 30 people in the UK, probably no even many, 20 people in the UK. Maybe 50 people, not even 50 people in Dublin. There\'s now what, 3000 people in Dublin? So, one of the early guys. I spent my first six months literally interviewing, I think I did 133 face to face interviews in my first year at LinkedIn. Literally, I was just focused on building just building the best team I possibly could. And so we built a team of, 18 Enterprise AE\'s. And we covered the UK market at that point because we had no other Sales functions outside of the UK covering EMEA. My guys would also cover particular geographical territories. So I remember at one point, you had people covering like, all of public sector UK and the Middle East. You look at LinkedIn now, and you look at how many people are employed in those two sectors, I mean, it\'s hundreds. So, it\'s that greenfield opportunity, which in itself brings a number of challenges around prioritization. And so yeah, my first year was building up Enterprise AE team, and then help to launch a number of different offices. I helped hire the guys that and onboarded the guys in Sweden who ran our Nordic office. We opened the Paris office and helped with the training and support in getting that office up and running. The UK RM business was launched that point as well. And so, the business really started to kind of build, and grow, and scale-out. So my first year was around hiring, building, specifically focused around the Enterprise AE space. Moving into the second year, I then managed Senior Enterprise AE\'s. And so there was, those were guys that...we had different gradients of Enterprise AE\'s. And then also managed our first kind of efforts in regards to channel and partnership program, in terms of both re-sellers and lead referral program. That was, that was really interesting to see that, and there\'s a whole bunch of challenges around that. By then, started to diversify the Sales team to be focused on different verticals. And that kind of moves us into my third year at LinkedIn had the opportunity to put together a business case for a specific vertical and then spend the next four years building that business up in EMEA. And built that essentially from scratch to over 200 people, 163 million ARR, 12-13,000 customers, 33% growth year on year. Even bigger than that obviously, in the first few years. And then that took me to my last role at LinkedIn, which was effectively a global overlay role for that entire vertical. A fantastic opportunity. But those are, I guess, the the main broad chapters of my time at LinkedIn. Naber:\xa0 When you were at LinkedIn, and now at Mixpanel you\'ve built out a playbook for building an EMEA-wide B2B SasS go-to-market strategy and plan. And you\'ve done this over the years, you\'ve iterated on it, and then you\'ve obviously you added on the global remit you had at your later stage of being at LinkedIn. Let\'s talk about that playbook for building an EMEA-wide B2B SaaS go to market strategy and plan. So, I\'d love to hear a couple of different pieces of it for the audience so they can hear how you think about it. So a couple of pieces being building strategy, selecting markets and when to start to expand into them, building product and enhancements to product, and then ultimately team and building out the structure and timing of your team - physical geography as well as hiring, managing them. So let\'s go through building strategy. So if you\'re thinking about building an EMEA-wide B2B SaaS go-to-market strategy, how do you think about building out the strategy and building out the market selection that you\'re going to then go execute on? Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, so I think I would start off by thinking around, it\'s a case of having, you start off from directional confidence. And I think, at this early stage, getting to a point where you are 80% comfortable and confident in the decisions that you\'re making, is really how you need to operate. And so some people say, oh, you have to get comfortable being uncomfortable. And I think that\'s BS, because the nature of being uncomfortable is, it is uncomfortable. But my interpretation of that is you\'ve got to be comfortable with being 80% confident, and it\'s okay to kind of...Because actually, the time it takes to get to the point of 100% confidence is actually dead time most of the time in a kind of scale-up phase, well, I guess I\'m talking about both start-up and scale-up. And so in terms of that directional confidence, you look at really just triangulating a number of different data points. And those are both hard and soft data points. And so, those could be things like, do you have an existing customer base? Do you have an existing user base? Do you have an existing user base from customers who are billed outside that particular geography? So whether you\'re a consumer business or a B2B business, understanding where is the traction that\'s currently, in the product, that\'s currently being made. If there\'s an associated user base to it, what is does the user base look like? What are the growth rates geographically for each of those sectors? Have you got companies that are growing far quicker than some other sectors? The other pieces of information you\'d probably overlay on top of that is looking at the existing customer base in terms of, are there any characteristics within that, in terms of company size, company type, industry? And so I guess it\'s a case of, really looking at all of the various different data points that you\'ve got available to you in terms of what you understand about your products, the product-market-fit, and also the individual psyche of the marketplace that you want to sell into, and their ability to buy the products. And I think that\'s actually quite often overlooked, and it\'s quite often overlooked from a cultural perspective, certainly with North American, West Coast technology companies. And so I\'ll give you, I\'ll give you two examples of that. So number one, when we launched in EMEA if you looked at LinkedIn, one of the proxies we used for potential success was, well, how engaged is a particular geographical region in regards to LinkedIn.com? And the assumption we made on that was we\'ll actually if there\'s significant traction on LinkedIn.com we think we can sell the concept of that audience to people within a particular geography. So, for example, we had a high degree of engagement amongst members within Denmark, But actually the notion of direct sourcing and headhunting from your competitors from a cultural perspective, was something that actually locally in Denmark is like, really, that\'s not the case now but certainly 10 years ago, whatever, the principle of direct sourcing kind of from an ethical perspective was something that they were uncomfortable with. So unless you happen to know that, a bunch of decisions could be made in North America based around data, in terms of wow, okay we\'ve run an algorithm based on penetration of membership, growth of online Sales agent within the product. We\'ve identified Denmark as a top-four market EMEA. But actually, the reality of that is there are cultural blockers to that particular product that we weren\'t aware of. So another practical example of that as well, is you can have a customer that in principle looks they should really use the product. But actually, when you dig into the particular persona of that company, do they actually have the capabilities of using the product? And so, I find that in lots of technology companies or lots of technology that I\'ve sold to, you can have on paper a company that looks the perfect persona that you should sell into, but actually, they\'ve got no evidence of purchasing similar products before in the past. They\'ve got no evidence of being a pro-technology company in terms of the investments they make. And in addition to that, from an organizational point of view, they didn\'t have someone internally that\'s the right person to use the product. So, an organizational understanding and sector understanding should be one of those data points that you kind of look at now. So you go back to my original point of like, directionally accurate. If you took the Nordic region and kind of made a series of assumptions, you\'re like, okay, yeah, we believe that that is a market that we want to be kind of going after. That is a core market for us. And effectively the way that I would categorize EMEA would be, what are your kind of core and emerging markets? And have a framework around how you define what your core markets are based on a bunch of data points that you triangulate to basically create an algorithm and a scoring mechanism. And then you can have a bunch of core and non-core markets. You then orientate Sales teams around those core markets with a percentage of their time focused on non-core markets that when they reach a particular tipping point, you kind of pull them into the fold and put more of a focus on them. Naber:\xa0 That\'s great. Thanks so much, Dan. This is a good transition and segue. As you started to think about it within your playbook, building out those teams, what\'s your mindset for hiring in EMEA in general? And then maybe even any regional nuances that you know that you need to go through, or process changes you need to have, or mindset shifts you need to have. Let\'s start with reps and then we can go to Frontline Managers. So as I\'m starting to hire out my first few reps, within my Sales team. How do I think about going about doing that within my playbook? Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, so I think one of the key things to think about is who do you need for the job that you need right now? And I think some of the mistakes that I\'ve made before in the past is I\'ve hired people that are the people that you would need in three years time. And so for me, I think, there\'s a whole bunch of challenges in selling technology now because companies have changed the way in terms of how they buy technology now. Technology purchasing has been, in many ways, it\'s been democratized by the employee. And so if you look at companies Slack as an example, you can have a company that\'s got 5,000 slack users, and they\'re not an official Enterprise customer of Slack. You\'ve just got an employee base using a product. So you\'ve got, companies now buy technology through individuals, through departments, and then at an Enterprise level. And so I guess the part of you understanding your own go to market strategy of, are you trying to go in at an Enterprise level? And is it a major infrastructure project? Or is it a rip and replace a competitor? Or is it land and expand? And so depending on your approach on how you want to go take a product to market, who your audience is, and the channel in how you want to introduce your products to that company, really depends then upon the type of persona, or personality, or experience of the person that you\'re looking for. So just being conscious of that I think is probably the first thing to think about. Off the back of that, you can then start to build out a whole bunch of skill sets and characteristics around what it is that you\'re actually looking for. I think one of the key considerations now is if you look at the backdrop against cloud computing and really the commoditization of every sector. If you look at, any business now needs to think about, okay, in three years time we will have five times more competitors. And all competing for the same budget, with the same decision-makers. And so, the very notion of that means the persona of someone that you need to be able to operate against that backdrop is really different. And so that\'s definitely something that I kind of think a lot about. And so the ability for people to then, be able to build relationships and network with an organization, help create consensus around how a decision is made, is key. The case of like, I\'m going to try and sell to the CEO because he\'s the decision-maker, those days are gone. People don\'t buy like that anymore. Companies don\'t buy like that anymore. And so there\'s a whole different set of skills that you need from people in terms of their softer skills, their ability to market, their ability to communicate about how your product both compete and compliments their existing technology stack in the sector, is key as well. Customers, by the way, won\'t even know this. If you go look at, I don\'t know, the Sales industry as an example. Five years ago you had LinkedIn Sales Navigator and a couple of other pieces of technology maybe. When you look at that sector now, I mean there are literally dozens of players doing dozens of different jobs there. And if you look at marketing, jeez, I mean that\'s an even crazier marketplace. And so your ability to be able to articulate, to a customer who themselves may not fully appreciate all of these different pieces of kit, and how you can either complement, enhance what they\'ve already bought, or actually how you can compete and say, Hey, I don\'t think you need these other three vendors because we can do the following things. And so that mindset and that skillset are different. So what you\'ve got to be able to do to be able to identify...a, have an awareness of that. B, be able to work out what are the skills and the behaviours that you need to be able to do that. So there\'s a good book, The Sales Acceleration Formula by Mark Roberg is a great book around, scaling business. He\'s one of the early guys at HubSpot, and I actually think that\'s a really super practical book. So I definitely recommend reading that. For me, two things that stand out that I always look for - You\'ve got grit and curiosity. And grit is to execute with passion and perseverance over time. Intellectual curiosity, someone is genuinely...I talk about this technology sector because I\'m genuinely interested in trying to understand why are customers buying the products they\'re buying? What is it they\'re trying to do? And how can you help that? And then the ability to be able to articulate and communicate the reasons as to why you think your value proposition makes sense. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. So let\'s say I\'m building out my first Frontline team. I\'ve built out my reps, I\'m hiring for the job I need now. I\'m thinking about how they need to build relationships, build consensus, communicate internally around how the product competes, enhances and compliments within the market. And then I\'ve hired against grit, curiosity, and communication. Now I need to build out my Frontline Managers. What\'s your mindset, some of the methods you use for hiring Frontline Managers? Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I\'m a fan of the core, strategic, and venture kind of methodology. Where you take a particular topic, and things that are core to that you assign 70% or seven out of 10, strategic is two out of 10, and venture is one of 10, 10% whatever you make to look at it. And so I think, for me, for a Frontline Manager, if you take the notion of, the science and the art of that. It\'s almost like, right, what are the core attributes, what are the strategic, and what are the venture? So what are the must-haves, nice- to-haves, and it would be good if but that is not as important? And so you\'re never gonna find somebody ticks the box on all of those things. There\'s always gonna be trade-offs. What are you not going to trade off on? One hasn\'t got or illustrates the following things, they\'re just simply are no. And that\'s across the two sectors of the science and art of management and leadership. So for me, it\'s having an under having a selection framework where you feel you\'re clear on exactly what the key skills and attributes are that you\'re looking for. Having an understanding or an appreciation of where you have a level of flexibility on that, and where you don\'t, are some of the key things. And actually taking the time to really go through that process in a pretty data-driven way, in terms of making sure is there a scoring mechanism against these things. Looking at other performers in the business who are doing really well, and how can you benchmark them against that particular person. And then also, hiring a leader for the role that you need now, and that you need in probably the next 24 months to 36 months are the key things. People talk about over hiring, and I think that\'s a good point, but if you overhire someone who has been a Frontline Manager, but then spent the last five years as a VP of Sales, and then you want to drop them back into a Frontline Sales Manager role because they\'ve got lots of experience, that doesn\'t work out. Because actually what you need them to be able to do is to have the appetite and the energy to focus on the core nucleus functions of a Frontline Manager, which involves deep level forecasting, deal coaching. So, who do you need to do the best job right now is one of the most fundamental questions I think you need to ask yourself, separate Frontline Leaders. Naber:\xa0 Yup. Got It. Excellent. So we\'ve covered a lot of the different pieces of the playbook than that you\'ve built out, especially when you started at TotalJobs, built out even more expansively when you\'re at LinkedIn, now that you\'re Mixpanel. We\'ve talked a lot about some of those pieces around building strategy, market selection, team and hiring across the different levels that you need to hire at. One more thing that I want to talk about is the difference between - and we talked about building these teams within EMEA - a lot of your mindset sounds globally applicable. However, I know that you have been in roles where you\'ve had a global remit and managing teams that are in EMEA, both at the same time as well as consecutively. So can you talk a little bit about some of the best practices that change when you are managing a regional team in EMEA versus managing on a global remit? Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, so I mean, I, I would say, so I would say having a clear set of expectations around what are the objectives, goals, and KPIs around the global piece of the job. And don\'t underestimate how difficult it is to influence and implement a global-wide initiative. And so I think, some of the things when you think about from a global basis, I think you\'ve got to change your mindset in terms of, if you\'re a hands-on Frontline Manager or even regional Director, you\'re personally in the region, you\'ve got a management team, you may not be on the Frontline with your reps or even front line Managers, but you\'ve got people that are within touchable distance from you. I think when you were then thinking about, well actually if there\'s an international organization, you\'re relying on and going to be working with a whole bunch of people across different continents, different geographies, different roles. And so managing and leading through influence becomes then a completely different kind of skillset. And I think the advice I would give on that is, if you take on more than you can effectively deliver, you will fail. So say, this sounds crazy obvious, okay, we want to do three things. And people always say, pick one of them and do that really well. And then in the back of your mind, you\'re saying but all three of them need to be done. And so you kind of try and delegate two of them out, and whatever it may be. But I would have a clear set of expectations with whoever you\'re reporting into to make sure that you can identify, okay, this is the global initiative or global change that I want to put in place. And just have a far more thorough and intensive approach to that kind of either change management or implementation of that than you think you need to do. And then just when you think you\'re kind of there, double down on it. So really prioritizing, pick the one thing that\'s going to impact globally, and drive that. And then for the things that fall underneath that, you either need to be comfortable that you\'re going to park that for a period of time, or that you\'re going to allow that to be managed and interpreted in a different way across different regions. And so I think that was one of the things when you\'ve got to a global overlay role, it\'s like, what are what\'s the systems, processes and methodologies that you want to see global consistency on. And actually, where do you want to ensure that you can encourage a more local dynamic approach. Naber:\xa0 Okay. That\'s a good time to talk about your jump into Mixpanel from LinkedIn. So why did you make the move to Mixpanel, and talk a little bit about what you\'re responsible for there. And then I\'ve got two more topics and we\'ll wrap. Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah...I\'ve got kind of like a Venn diagram answer to that question. And so effectively, the assessment process that I go through in regards to any opportunities. Number one, the first circle is like, is there a big enough macroeconomic backdrop driver that makes this product or company important enough to matter or viable enough? And if you look at the impact of industry 4.0, you look at the huge exponential growth around the app economy, you look through the digitalization that all companies are going through in terms of how their digital products are now their company. You talk to a financial institution, a major bank, their online experience for their customers is now no longer a nice to have, that is what their business is built around. So you\'ve got these, this huge backdrop of industry 4.0, digitization, the applicant economy, consumer behaviour. It\'s never been easier for a consumer to switch any product. You look at how cloud computing has commoditized all industries and all sectors. There\'s basically this massive backdrop of opportunity around the digital economy. I\'ve always been a big fan of, during the gold rush be the guy selling shovels, or pickaxes, or whatever. And so for me, that was a pretty big backdrop. The second piece is around, so how does the product that you\'re selling actually impact that major global trend? And so when I assessed Mixpanel, Mixpanel was already nine years old, 26,000 customers, 40% (four-zero) were based in EMEA and there were less than a half a dozen people in EMEA. You had companies from one person, digital-first companies in Finland, to major Enterprise companies in Turkey. And so you\'ve got scalability of the product in terms of geography. You\'ve got scalability of the product in terms of company size. And scalability of the company in terms of sector. And so that was the second piece for me. And then thirdly, it\'s around the people. And to be frank, this is more important, really, is around the people and the culture. Mixpanel has brought in a new CEO, a guy called, Amir Movafaghi. He\'s like, just one of the best leaders I\'ve worked with, really inspirational. He\'s an ex-Twitter executive. He\'s was like the Mr Fix it at Twitter. He\'s an incredible leader to work for. And I believed in his vision of what he wanted to do to build and take the company to its next level. So those were the three criteria that I looked at in terms of assessing any opportunity. And for me, Mixpanel fits squarely in the middle of those three things. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Okay. Just tell the audience what you\'re responsible for it Mixpanel, and then I\'ve got two questions for you. Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yep. So, I\'m basically the Director of international for EMEA and LATAM. So primary responsibility for building out the go-to-market teams in those two regions. I\'m based in London, but we\'ve just opened a new office in Barcelona, we\'ve opened a new office in Paris, and we\'re opening in Amsterdam. Taking the team from when I joined at 10 people, to we\'ve got a financial headcount plan for the end of the year, it\'d be probably, 110, 115 people in EMEA alone. So 10x in the business in terms of headcount, and obviously trying to grow the revenue contribution pretty exponentially on top of that as well. So I\'m at that early expansion phase. This year I\'ve done a hundred interviews. We\'ve now got ten AE\'s in the UK, four RM\'s. We\'ve got 10 AE\'s in Barcelona, and four RM\'s. We\'ve got a half dozen people across Amsterdam, and Paris. We\'ve stood up an SDR team in Barcelona as well. We\'ve got a whole bunch of pre- and post- technical Salespeople that we\'re introducing into the company. And so we\'re building the EMEA business from the ground up in terms of not just our Sales teams but all of the cross-functional partners that we need in place to be able to execute as well as we can. Naber:\xa0 Nice one. I love how your 10x\'ing, the headcount this year. In three or four years from now, you and I are going to have a conversation about how early that sounded, and how early-stage that sounded for where you\'re going to be in three or four years. Okay, great. So thanks for that overview. And then the last topic I have is, let\'s talk about Mixpanel. What does Mixpanel do extremely well? That is a competitive asset because they\'re just excellent at it naturally. It\'s at the core of what they do. Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yes. I think there is an institutional belief and passion around what it is that we\'re trying to do and the impact that we are trying to have for our customers to help them be successful, to help them build better products, to help them operate against this backdrop of huge disruption that we see. And I think the passion and belief that runs right through this business is something that\'s both powerful and intoxicating, and absolutely a competitive advantage. So, belief in purpose, belief in the vision, and collective alignment around what it is that we\'re trying to do collectively creates a really powerful unified business. The power of the pack is the wolf, and the power of the wolf is the pack. This definitely, definitely feels like an aligned business. And that\'s one thing that is built by having good leaders in place, having a great vision, having a great mission, having a product team listens to customers. One of the things that we do better than any other company I\'ve seen, this is the single best company that I\'ve ever seen in regards to, how we truly listen to our customers and don\'t have this arrogant perception that we know better than what our customers want. And this is definitely a competitive advantage. Naber:\xa0 And what have you seen are some of the ways that the leaders in the business are making sure that you keep those core competencies? Daniel Dackombe:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, I mean it\'s kind of the notion of, to some extent it\'s the Jeff Wiener notion of Next Play. Whereas like, you don\'t allow your successes to become overly important, and you don\'t allow your losses to pull you down. If you think about ultimate performance is like a flat line, okay...that big spike up, the higher that spike up, the longer it takes to get back down to your optimal performance. If things go bad, and that drop falls through the ocean floor, it takes longer to get up to the optimal motion. So it\'s, recognize what you\'re doing well, be happy about it, move on. Something bad happens, learn from it. Don\'t do it again. Move on. And the quicker you can kind of go through that cycle - of celebration, recognition, learning, moving on, through to failing at something, learning from it, and then moving on - the quicker you can operate.

Naber:\xa0 DKatz. Awesome to have you on the show. It\'s great to see your bearded face. How are you? David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I\'m great, BNabes. And for those at home, you should also clarify what our full names are, although nicknames are great. I think I once called you just BNabes or even beautiful Nabes. Naber:\xa0 I dunno if you remember that. I mean that would\'ve been, that\'s going pretty deep back into the archives of my history and memory. Naber:\xa0 Haha, that\'s pretty good. If you called me beautiful, first of all, I think I do remember you calling that, second of all, you may be the only person that\'s ever called me that. So if I don\'t remember, that\'s pretty bad cause that\'s an amazing story for myself. Thank you for that. Appreciate the confidence boost as we get started. And I\'m just looking, I\'m just looking to match your beard skills and your hairstyle. I feel like you\'ve nailed the combo. I feel like you\'ve really nailed the combo. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 So for those at home that are just listening to the audio, if you went and actually just googled David Katz at Tessian or found me on LinkedIn, you\'d see this shiny bald head. And yeah, I mean when we worked together, I had some hair, but maybe one or two of the things we\'ll talk about is the high pressure environments I put myself in more recently that caused me to lose all said hair. But I say like, dude, this look without a beard and glasses to soften it up. Like, if you could imagine this, without glasses. I\'ll take them off so you can see and then imagine now, if you take those things away, you\'re getting into the Doctor Evil territory. And I don\'t know if that\'s necessarily all look that is inviting and encouraging of future conversations. So anyways, I appreciate that. Naber:\xa0 Yeah, it\'s an evolution. I\'m sure that it feels right that Dr Evil is what you\'re moving towards in your life. But I\'m sure you\'ve perfected the morning routine pretty well with the head, the beard, the glasses. Like it\'s gotta be a pretty solid morning routine at that point. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Less than five minutes. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Awesome. That\'s what I like to hear. Every, every guy wants to hear that. All right, so let\'s hop into a couple things. One, we\'ll go through some personal stuff first. Mr Smarty pants grew up in New Hampshire, went to Syracuse, some interesting history, interested in debate, and government, and voracious reader obviously, and I\'m sure that started at a really young age. So we\'ll talk about all that fun stuff as a kid, what you were like, then we\'ll hop into the professional stuff, talk about some of your superpowers, talk about tech businesses you\'ve worked with, and ultimately get into your superpower mindset as well as methodology, and some frameworks around some of the things you\'re really good at. Sound okay? David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, let\'s do it. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. let\'s start personal first. So 5,000 population town lake Winnipesaukee. I\'m totally gonna screw up any one syllable that I\'m sure. So, you grew up in that town. Let\'s talk about what was it like being DKatz as a kid? What were you interested in? And what were some of your hobbies and things you were good at growing up? David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I was a high energy and devious child, but not like in a malicious way. Like I wasn\'t getting arrested or lighting Barbie dolls on fire, per se. But I was a bit of a menace to society or to my teachers at least. I definitely was always pushing the boundaries of what I feel like I could get away with. And I feel like that\'s pretty much just continued throughout my entire life. Let\'s just see how far we can push this. And now I\'m being penalized by having a two and a half year old that\'s doing the same thing. And what my mom used to tell me as a kid, whic is now coming true, which is, I hope you have a son just like you someday. For better, for worse, that\'s coming to fruition with my two and half year old. So yeah, I mean you said it, I grew up in a small town, 5,000 people. And it was an amazing, beautiful place to grow up. It just wasn\'t super diverse. Like there wasn\'t a lot of opportunity to be exposed to a lot of different things. It was a it was a very touristy environment that I grew up in. The population would grow by like 10x in the summer. People love to coming up to the lake. I mentioned to you earlier, Jimmy Fallon named his daughter after Lake Winnie, this lake I grew up on. It\'s just like a beautiful, nice, small town that kind of grew up on. But yeah, always interested in government, government affairs, and debate. I had this amazing teacher in high school, Mr Zoolof, who was very supportive and encouraging. I just felt a strong connection to. And, from taking classes with him, decided to really pursue a career in political science and public policy, or this thought I wanted to. So that\'s when I went to school for up in the upstate New York at Syracuse University. Naber:\xa0 Very cool. Shout out to Mr Zoolof off. I like that. So one more thing about, DKatz growing up. What were you interested in? What was the first thing you did to make money? Tell us a little bit more. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So, I was very interested in extreme sports growing up, or what I thought were extreme sports at the time. So it was a bit of a daredevil. I spent a lot of time in the emergency room. But I was very into freestyle skiing, wakeboarding, mountain biking, hiking, climbing, pretty much anything where I could lose a sense of gravity for some small period of time. I really enjoyed as a child. And it wasn\'t until my twenties where I started having real serious injuries that I didn\'t rebound from so quickly, and I decided maybe need to slow down. But yeah, I mean like I was a bit of a speed freak. I wanted to go, high and far in the air in whatever I was doing. So, outside of school and things I was interested in politics. I was really most first and foremost interested in just, thrill and just kind of chasing that feeling, as a kid. Naber:\xa0 Okay. So I have a hundred questions on that stuff, but we\'ve got to move on so I won\'t indulge in my own curiosity. So you\'re going through high school, you\'re making a decision to go to, upstate New York, Syracuse University, The Orange, which I think is like one of 11 schools that have a mascot that don\'t end in "S", I believe, something like that. One of 10 or one of 11. We don\'t need to go through the trivia, but that\'s actually a fun trivia question. So why do you make that decision to go to Syracuse? Walk us through what you were like for a couple minutes while you were at Syracuse. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, I mean, first and foremost, I didn\'t get into Georgetown, which was my number one. And I just, I didn\'t get it, and I was pretty bummed about that, honestly. I just really wanted to be in DC. I really wanted to be in that, that environment cause I really want to study political science and public policy. But I would say in hindsight, I was very fortunate that I didn\'t get in that I went to Syracuse. It was an incredible program that going to be part of, I met my future wife and mother of our son, and soon to be our second son. She\'s due literally any day now. And yeah, so it worked out for the best. One of the things that was really attractive to me about Syracuse was the curriculum for the public policy program was very hands on. It was actually a much less academic approach to learning. Most of the curriculum was made up of internships and kind of co-op style work. So you literally get thrown in the deep end. Even as early as being a freshman and a pimply faced 18 year old there I was working on different programs, like the Syracuse Housing Authority. And I\'m getting to be involved in the community at a young age. Really kind of shaped the way I thought about learning and our education system more broadly, which is probably another topic for another time of things I\'d like to do much, much later in life regarding education. It was just super hands on curriculum you actually got to get out there in the world and mix it up and meet people. But probably most importantly was, the Head of the Department Dr Bill Coplan, who I got to be a teaching assistant for, told me, I can\'t remember if I was either a junior or senior, he told me, he\'s like, Katz your wasting your time man. Like you\'re not, this isn\'t going to be a career. You\'re to be in Sales. And I\'ve said this before in other podcasts, but I was like so offended by that. Because growing up in a small town in New Hampshire, I didn\'t know anything about Sales other than like the guy at the footlocker trying to sell me shoes, or like the guy selling my parents their car. That was my only in the sense of like what Sales was growing up. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. I always say that it\'s viewed as a dirty word often times. We\'re coming around as a society, especially in Western countries. But it\'s a bit of a dirty word as you\'re growing up. Yeah. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 And it was to me, certainly when I was a young student. But I\'m fortunate that he did plant that seed and ended up coming to fruition years later. And I personally credit him for that. Naber:\xa0 Cool. Love it. And do you, what you don\'t say in that whole explanation is you were very good student. Obviously really intelligent, very obvious to people that have a conversation with you within seconds. So, you meet Shana, going through University, and you\'re gonna make your first decision on, what\'s next after uni. So why don\'t we do this. Walk us through. We\'re going to get up to LinkedIn. And then we\'re going to hop through LinkedIn, Dropbox, Intercom, and your recent move to Tessian. We\'re going to hop through those with some questions and going a little bit deeper on your playbook. But walk us through your decision out of school for the first job that you got, all the way through LinkedIn. and then we\'ll stop at LinkedIn and we\'ll pause for a couple of different things. I want to talk about that. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, totally. So, coming out of uni as you said, and for the Americans, that also means college. But having led and worked with international teams, it\'s definitely called Uni or university outside of the states. Same as resumes, their called CV\'s, right? Or curriculum vitae. Naber:\xa0 I did a calculation on this. Like 5% of the world\'s population or so is in the US, and 95% is outside. You do the math, it\'s actually staggering as to how much the sociopolitical environment as well as, a whole bunch of other things that the US does and makes decisions on affects the other 95% of the world. But the disproportionate amount of people that actually vote for those things, which is like 1.7 to 2% at any given times, just depending on how many people vote, of the world\'s population votes on, and has say in what types of things happen in our environment in the US, then subsequently affect the rest of the world. And I just always think it\'s interesting when we talk about some of that terminology because when all of those folks are listening, they think to themselves, obviously it\'s called that, but it\'s just cause that\'s their mindset obviously. Anyways, keep going. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 And that\'ll come back later too, I think. When you new companies, part of the onboarding experience is just getting a sense of are we speaking the same language? Because every company I\'ve joined, and I\'m sure this has been similar for you, and more recently in your consulting experience, people use terms so interchangeably. And what I learned early on is like, don\'t take that for granted and make sure you\'re really clear. Like, when you say that, what do you actually mean? Like, especially if you\'re going to work with companies that have international teams, people interpret language very differently. And even like, when I say inside Sales and what that means here in the States, that\'s viewed very differently, and has a different connotation in Europe. So anyways, just a little point there. So yeah, coming out of school. So I had no idea what the hell I want to do. I just realized through my internships in school that I didn\'t want to pursue a career short term in the government and nonprofits space. And I honestly, through a weird series of events, just fell completely backwards into a very interesting small Executive search firm called J Robert Scott that was a wholly owned subsidiary of Fidelity Investments. I\'d never heard of it. It\'s not something people go to school and study and say, I want to work in Executive search when I grew up. I had no idea recruiting was a thing, and an industry, and it\'s actually massive. And so I fell back words into it, and it was just like the biggest point of luck in my early career to have that type of opportunity because I got exposed to so many cool people in cool industries. So we worked with hardware, software, medical device, biopharmaceutical companies. We primarily worked with early stage venture-capital backed companies, and we were working to like bring additions into their Executive team as they were growing and reaching different stage of maturity. We would help them add different roles, and functionality, expertise to their Executive teams. And so I was like such a cool way to essentially get paid out an MBA, straight out of school. And I got exposed to a lot of very interesting people, and got a sense of the way the world works, at least as it pertains specifically to the VC world. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. I love the narrative to that value prop as well. That\'s really cool. Cause you say Executive search, it can mean so many different things for the value prop. I\'d like that narrative a lot. So J Robert Scott, wholly owned by Fidelity Investments, and you\'re at J Robert Scott. What\'s the biggest thing you learned from there, and then why the jump to LinkedIn? David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The biggest thing I learned was, there\'s no reason that I can\'t aspire to be a successful Executive at a company at some point in time. And the reason I said that there say that is I had so many people, I was like, how the hell did you become CEO and president of this company? And it\'s kind of funny and to say it that way, but like it gave me a lot of confidence. I can do this. And I think when you\'re young, or if you\'re a Sales rep, or if you\'re an aspiring Executive within the commercial realm, or really any role, I think you look at these people and you put them on such a pedestal. And the reality is they\'re just humans like you and I. And getting to sit in on some of these board meetings and hear some of the things that they would discuss, I was like, these people aren\'t that special. In many cases, they really think they are. But there\'s no reason while others can\'t have the type of success that they are, at least perceived to have, if you just work hard and kind of pursue the right things. Naber:\xa0 Nice one. That\'s great. I liked that. That\'s a really good takeaway. And so you\'re moving into... David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, you probably weren\'t expecting me to say that. You thought I was going to say something completely different. Something that would\'ve made more sense like, the importance of hiring the right talent, and talent is the key to everything. Yeah, I could have said that. But you know what, like, no, that\'s what I really learned personally and selfishly. Naber:\xa0 So, you\'re making the jump to LinkedIn. Why do you make that decision and kind of walk us through your journey at LinkedIn, for the time that you were there for each of the roles you subsequently jumped into. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, so when I was working in Executive search, I had an opportunity to move to San Francisco and help our firm establish a west coast presence. And so we actually hired a partner from one of the big Executive search firms on the west coast...amazing firm, been around for a very long time, very successful. And I think, I don\'t know if they\'re public now, but they were at one point in time. And anyways, we hired this awesome partner, Eric Lund, and we had a great working relationship. We got to work on a couple of projects together and really establish like a good working relationship. And he invited me to come out to the Bay Area and work with him. So I leapt at the opportunity, convinced my then girlfriend, now wife to move out with me. But as soon as I got here, like it\'s just, the environment\'s infectious. It\'s so hard not to get excited about wanting to go and work for one of these companies. And I was just so envious being on th outside looking in. And after about a year of helping Eric kind of establish our west coast practice, hire some other folks to join the firm, I was like, I gotta go get into one of these companies. I started thinking, what do I want to do functionally, like what kind of role would I want to go for, and then what type of company? And I think given my more recent experience, when when I decided to leave J Robert Scott, I was doing selling and I didn\'t really realize it. I was selling candidates on thinking about opportunities outside of what they currently had. I was selling those candidates then on our clients that we\'re working with to help them kind of place people at the companies they were invested in and part of. And then I was selling other, potential clients on hiring us to do work for them. And so I didn\'t realize it because it wasn\'t like a less structured way of, I didn\'t have quotas per se. I\'m like, you more traditionally did in Sales in a SaaS Sales role, but really I was in Sales. And it was a pretty challenging role, because it\'s not a business risk, it\'s a personal career risk, right? You\'re selling people on why they should think about leaving one role as an Executive for another one that might be much more risky. And so it took a lot of listening, and I really learned how to listen very carefully to what was really important to people and see if it would be the right opportunity. But anyways, so then I figured out, okay, Sales is probably somewhere I could play. Then I started thinking about what\'s a Product that I\'m super passionate about. I spent all day on LinkedIn as anyone in recruiting, right? So, I decided I wanted to pursue a Sales career specifically in LinkedIn. I actually didn\'t apply anywhere else. I didn\'t even apply to LinkedIn. I cold called my way in. There was a guy...Tyler Hubs, who had a background similar to me, and I literally cold called, left a voicemail, and he actually called me back. And he invited me down for lunch, and I got to go down and meet in Mountain View with him, with some of the team, and our then VP of Sales, James Volpentest, who I know you\'re very familiar with and worked for. And it was at a point where, LinkedIn was growing like crazy and they\'re like, yeah, like we\'ll take a shot on this guy. And I think the opportunity cost was low enough that they were willing to kind of take on bet on somebody who\'d never done software Sales before. And so I joined, I joined as a Sales rep and that was, let\'s see, I\'d say, I think I accepted my offer towards the end of 2010. And I think I joined in January, 2011. Naber:\xa0 January 5th, 2011. That was our start date. Nice one. Okay, so you make that jump. Now walk us through your journey at LinkedIn for the different roles that you had. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 So I started as an Account Executive, and loved it. Learned mostly through trial and error. Just because it was such a fast paced environment and things were kind of like half-built as you would imagine they would be at a company in that stage and for how fast they\'re moving. But I was super fortunate given the kind of culture at that company. And it\'s still, the culture at the time was just so collaborative and so focused on development. And my peers around me were so willing to invest in me, and give me time, and let me shadow, and learn more about their processes. They would sit in on my process and give me advice. And so I was fortunate, I got off to a pretty quick start at the beginning of the year. And then about halfway through the year, we had this weird situation where, there was a cohort of us that were doing pretty well, and then there was several cohorts of people who were not. There\'s like this huge gap where there was either people like blowing out their numbers, or there are people really not even coming close to their targets. And we had pretty aggressive goals that year. and we were getting ready to file and go public. And so it was important to get more predictability in the business. And so they offered me and several other folks this opportunity to become a team lead. Which at the time I thought I was like the coolest thing ever, and if I actually think more critically about it, I\'m like, wait a minute. Like, I was kind of taken advantage of here. They were like, hey, how does this sound? We\'re going to pay the same amount of money, but we\'re going to, quadruple your risk. And we\'re going to have you take on quotas for four other people. Don\'t worry about the fact that you\'ve closed more revenue than all four of them combined in the first half of the year. Like this is probably gonna work out just fine. And when I joined LinkedIn, one of my mantras early on was, I wanted to like really be part of this journey, and I wanted to sign up and take risks. And I wasn\'t sure if Sales was the right thing for me. I wasn\'t sure if software tech was the right thing for me, but I told myself like, look, I\'m young at this point. I wasn\'t married. I didn\'t have kids. I didn\'t have a mortgage. I\'m just going to say yes, I\'m going to take on as much risk, as an opportunity as I can and see what comes of it. And so I jumped at it. I didn\'t really think about it too much. And was like, great, let\'s see if we can figure it out. And we did, and that second half of the year, I\'m proud to say that the team I got to work with were exceptional people and their willingness to listen to some punk kid, who didn\'t have a ton of experience in SaaS Sales, and work with me, and work as a team was incredible. And we turned around and we hit our second half targets. Three of the four folks actually hadn\'t achieved their annual targets. Some of them got promoted. And that was the big inflection point for me. That was when I realized like I had found my calling. And I\'m so fortunate, and honestly just lucky, that relatively early on in my career I had this Aha moment, where I was like, this is what I was meant to do. Naber:\xa0 Very cool. Very cool. So, walk us through then your navigation into leading Sales Dev teams, and then your Mid Market Sales Management role that you had. And then we\'ll hop into one topic that I want to talk about because I know you started flexing your muscle pretty hard on it at LinkedIn. And then, we\'ll jump into Dropbox. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So, after those six months as a team lead, I jumped at any opportunity I could find to get into a management role cause I was like, this is what I want to be doing. And I was fortunate enough there was an opening for a role managing a Sales Development team in San Francisco, and I interviewed for and got the role. And we actually, this is where BNabes and I got closes, we actually were both peers and we\'re managing, Sales Development teams. And our boss, Jeff at the time, like I think somewhat begrudgingly gave me the role. Like, I think he had his concerns. And if anyone, this is a total inside joke, but if you knew Jeff, he would know like he\'s not afraid to just tell you his concerns early on, and just make sure they\'re out there and open. Which is something that I learned is actually, an incredible trait to have is just be open and transparent with people. And he told me why he gave me the role, but he also listed all the concerns he had, and things he wanted to make sure I avoided early on. And fortunately he gave me the role, and he gave me a lot of coaching, especially in the early days on how to be successful as a people Manager, as a first time people Manager. So yeah, I inherited a team. My initial team was 15 or 16 reps, which is like twice the size of the team you should give to a first time Manager. And on top of that, Jeff, who was my boss, but it was in Dublin. So like we had this eight hour time difference. So it wasn\'t like he was on the floor helping me all the time, or if I had like some in the moment need, I didn\'t have him to go to. Luckily had some amazing peers that I worked with closely in the San Francisco office that would help kind of guide me and make sure I didn\'t screw up too bad. So I did that for a year. It was amazing. I loved it. Working with, developing people early on in their careers who want to pursue Sales, which just like such a rewarding experience. And I quickly made my goal just to get as many of them promoted as I possibly could and get them on to the next role. And this is where I actually learned about the power of brand and being viewed as a multiplier in people\'s careers, and how that would always mean that I would have my pick of the most talented people to recruit. And so advice for any of you who are in a management role, at a slightly larger organization where there\'s a lot of internal promotion, you want your brand to be known as a multiplier. You don\'t want to be viewed as an empire builder who just hoards the best talent. That will serve you well in the short term, but in the longterm it\'s going to bite you in the ass. You want to be known as the person who is focused on the development career of others. And if you do that, people will be knocking down your door to get on your team. And I feel fortunate, like I was able to establish my brand that way. And look at served people well on my team, but selfishly, like it served me well too. I always had the most talented people wanting to work with and for me. So it worked for all of us. So I got to do that for a year. And then in my last year at LinkedIn I went back to actually managing the team I initially joined. Which is such a weird full circle to go through in my time at LinkedIn. And so I got to go manage Account Executives, SMB & Mid-Market Account Executives that next year at LinkedIn as well. And cool enough, got to bring some of the Sales Development reps that I hired along the way on that journey with me. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Okay. So, I know that you started flexing really hard a muscle around hiring. Especially onboarding and hiring, and bringing on great talent. By the way, the skill that you just mentioned...it\'s talent, but the also skill that you just mentioned, but you\'re naturally good at it, so it\'s a talent...around making sure that you become and are known as a multiplier. Like that just has so much more effect on not just the people that, are coming to work for you. People that have worked with you, but like the people that are your peers, like your peers would want to come work for you also or the people that you\'ve worked for would want to come work for you also and work with you because that\'s your style. It\'s given back to you company over company role of role. I mean, I feel that personally towards you and I know a lot of people that have worked with you feel that way as well, not just the people that are working for you. So it\'s got an amazing effect, and a big halo, including sideways and up. But one of the things I know that you started flexing your muscle on his hiring and onboarding great talent. Let\'s talk about, your philosophy around hiring and bringing on great talent, which you\'ve done well beyond obviously those roles into Dropbox, into Intercom, and into Tessian now. So what is your philosophy on hiring great talent? And let\'s go through some of the methodology you have. If you have any best practices around each piece of that process as you try to bring them on board. From profiling the role, to sourcing and interviewing them, to evaluating, closing, onboarding, etc. So what\'s your philosophy, and what\'s kind of your methodology, and your processes you go through, with some tactics that you use? David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, first I would say I am a recruiter\'s worst nightmare as a former recruiter to work with as a hiring Manager . And if any of them were listening to us, they\'d probably laugh. And I think ultimately we have good working relationships, but like to say, I expect a lot, and I have a very high bar for hiring is an understatement. I would say what I learned from my recruiting experience, and then what I learned from some mentors early on, was the two things I was hiring for were mentality and dynamic. And I think the second one is something that people don\'t pay enough attention to when they\'re hiring. And I think it\'s really important to be intentional when you\'re putting a team or teams together that you also need to be hiring for a team dynamic, and you have to have the right blend of backgrounds and experiences of people in that team. And if you just hire a lot of people with with the right mentality that are just high achieving people but won\'t create the right team team dynamic, that team\'s not going to be actually as effective as they could be. so I\'m pretty quickly realized that you needed to hire for diversity and hire for a specific dynamic. And that ultimately meant that there were times where I passed on people that I knew would have been very successful individually, but wouldn\'t have an additive to the team and the team dynamic. I would say like that\'s a big thing I learned early on, at LinkedIn. And the second thing I learned was you have to be intentional. So what I mean by that is intentional around your recruiting process, and your interview process, and be consistent. I think the tendency when you\'re moving really quickly or an environment where you\'re hiring fast is you just need to just hire great people and set them free. And I think people don\'t spend enough time up front really defining and being intentional about what their hiring process should be. What are the types of interview questions and interview experiences and exposures you want to have for that person that\'s coming in to make sure you\'re consistently testing for certain things, to see if they\'re going to be successful in your environment, but also make sure that they\'re going to be happy in your environment and for the state that you\'re in. And I definitely learned the hard way several times that you need to hire for the current state of things, and don\'t oversell an opportunity or role. You should not be afraid to talk about all of the hairy problems that your company has. And the people that are going to be right for you, like when you mention all of the challenges that you and the team are facing, they\'re going to light up. You\'re going to literally watch their body language change if you\'re in the room with them, where they\'re going to lean in and be like, tell me more about that. Like they\'re going to be attracted to those types of problems and that environment. And so often I see people, especially at high growth companies trying to hire people, just been there and done that at larger companies, and have been, quote unquote, in the end zone, so to speak. And that\'s really risky because if you\'ve hired people who\'ve only worked at very large established companies, they might have great training, but they might not, possess the mindset to be successful in a fast paced, ambiguous environment. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. I like that. I\'ve heard that consistently from great leaders that are excellent at hiring great talent, is the underestimation of the last thing you just mentioned around the importance of it. So, very quickly, you\'ve hired a lot of people and a spectrum of different roles. Can you go through and talk about how you onboard really good talent as well? What are some of the things you\'ve learned about onboarding great talent that you felt have been consistent, regardless of, of the role that you\'re bringing on? David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, that\'s a good one. I think a onboarding is a staged kind of sequenced process that you can\'t try to throw everything at someone upfront in the first two weeks. They\'re not gonna retain 90% of the information you give them. And so I think you need to be very specific and intentional around the prioritization of what they need to know and at what time you need to teach them it. And really make sure you get the sequencing right there. And that\'ll be the difference between like, an okay onboarding and a really rapid one, is like what\'s really critical in the first couple quarters for the person to know and learn, and really focused us on those things. And then get comfortable, not teaching someone some of the finer skills that they\'re gonna need, six or 12 months later and stage it out. Make sure that those things are things you focus on as like the next onboarding once they\'re six or nine months in. So really think about those things. The other thing I would say about onboarding is I\'m a huge fan of situational leadership theory, or the Hersey and Blanchard theory on coaching. And for those, go Google it and check it out and you can watch a quick video or it\'s just a Google image on it and kind of map it out. But the other thing I realized early on is no matter how much experience someone has, they are hiring, they\'re early onboarding you actually need to be very explicit and very directive with them around what you expect and what you want them to do. And no matter how much experience they have, they actually find a lot of confidence in having this like blanket of you being really directional. And I think the hesitation people have is like, well, I don\'t want to micromanage someone. And like, I don\'t want to seem like I\'m being overly burdensome on them. It\'s like, no, I know that\'s your instinct. We don\'t want to do that because no one really likes to be micromanaged. But early on when you\'re new to a company, people find a lot of safety and confidence in that. So I think it\'s really important to be directive early on. Also be very clear early on of around the expectations of the role. Define what excellence looks like in the role and how someone should be kind of conducting themselves, and what their performance should look like over time, and what behaviors they should exhibit, and how they match back to your culture or values. Really lay that out early on. I can\'t tell you how many people I\'ve talked to where I\'m like, what are your cultural values and how do you talk about them in the first, the first two weeks of onboarding? Or even just companies that I\'ve interviewed, or spent time, with or advised, where I ask them what their cultural values are, if you can\'t name them off the top of your tongue immediately, something\'s missing and you need to go back and revisit that. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. All right DKatz, let\'s move into your jump into Dropbox. Why\'d you move there? Walk us through, in a couple of minutes, the roles that you had. And then we\'re going to stop and talk about one or two topics there as well. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 So I moved there because of a lack of patience and a naivete, most likely. Like I think, I got my first taste of success at LinkedIn, and if we\'re being honest each other, I probably took it a bit for granted. Like I looked back on it so fondly, and I made some incredible friends and mentors and I learned so much, and like as I said, literally changed the trajectory of my career and it helped me find my calling. But like, if I\'m being honest, could I have stayed for a couple of more years and learned a lot more? Yeah. Did I probably prematurely leave because I thought I\'d figured out everything in the world? Yes. I was definitely in that category of millennial, first time people either who knew everything. And also just, assumed that all of my success was due to like my own skill, and it wasn\'t any element of luck, or just working for an amazing company with amazing Product. So like I definitely felt this sense of like, I\'m owed this opportunity. And all of a sudden this company Dropbox comes along, and everyone at that point in time had heard of it. It\'s one of the hottest companies out there. They raised a stupid amount of money at a stupid valuation. And for whatever reason, like they were willing to give me this opportunity to come and build something. And that was an opportunity I wasn\'t going to have, immediately at LinkedIn, and I decided to go and pursue it. Looking back on it, it was the best thing I ever could have done, but it was also 10 times harder than I thought it was going to be. I was all of a sudden out there in the real world, and building something from scratch without a lot of mentors or people who could coach me along the way or provide a playbook to me that I could rely on. And I had a lot of really brutal hard lessons in those early days, and that\'s when I started to lose my hair most likely. So I don\'t regret it. It was amazing. The type of talent and the things I learned from that experience were just incredible. And I was so fortunate to work with such incredibly talented people at Dropbox. It\'s funny, so many of us stay in very close touch and look back at like this, this alumni association we have of former Dropbox\'ers, and it\'s incredible how willing people are around the globe to just drop what they\'re doing and help you if you guys overlapped together at Dropbox, is just insane. It\'s just, it was really special. So, yeah, it was definitely the naivete. Naber:\xa0 And then, what were you responsible for? Walk us through your jumps to while you were at Dropbox. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, so I came into help them build a outbound kind of direct Sales motion and go to market strategy for their SMB and Mid-Market segments. At that time when I got there, there really wasn\'t a business Product, they were just getting ready to launch it. They\'d been playing around with like an early iteration of it, and they were doing pretty well, from a self serve perspective. And they had some early traction with a small enterprise team. Just going out and literally trying to just win logos. But no one was paying attention to or focusing on like SMB and Mid-Market at all as a segment. And so I was brought in to help them see if we could figure out a direct Sales motion to cover those segments in North America. And so early days it was about trying to understand the build out a playbook of, what did we think they\'re going to market motion was going to be? Why would people want Dropbox for business? What problems can it solve for them? And then why did they need that in addition to what they were getting for free from Microsoft or Google, or are they already paying for from Box? And so we\'re kind of figuring out what our value proposition would be. And then once we figured it out, we started thinking around what was the hiring profile of people we wanted to bring that would help us, figure out something that wasn\'t completely built. and so I spent a lot of time focused on those things. And then, I joined there, let\'s see, that was the end of 2013, and we did some light hiring early, but then we really hit the go button in 2014. And I hired, well in the first five quarters, so including Q4 of 2013, I hired 55 people. In order to hire those 55 people I must\'ve interviewed, upwards of 500 plus. Yeah, definitely more than 500. So it was crazy, spent whole days and nights interviewing. But it was, it was wild. We had some early success. We\'ve found something that felt repeatable. We found kind of our ideal customer profile. We started figuring out the value proposition, why they would need us, how we could make that Sales motion repeatable. And then we started to start training the team on it. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Love it. Thank you for that. So, one of the things that you\'ve done multiple times in your career is managing and building out that playbook for the upstream motion to go SMB, Mid Market, Enterprise. What does that playbook look like for you? And what are the steps that you need to take in order to be successful as you\'re building out, and executing on that playbook? David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, it\'s it\'s a really fun motion. And to to your point, I did that both at Dropbox and then at Intercom as well, where we were moved from a very down market, more self-serve, kind of motion, or at least certainly as an acquisition strategy. Where it\'s kind of like, get in, land and then through kind of viral organic growth, and strong Product adoption, and Product love, we\'ll see some natural kind of organic growth, after they become a customer. And we saw that Dropbox and at Intercom. In both cases what was also similar is, and why I joined in both cases, was there was this sense that you could just move that self-service very efficient, acquisition model up market and start winning larger and larger customers over time. And what they realized in both cases was no, that wasn\'t the case. And there\'s kind of a natural breaking point where you get to a certain company size where you have clear definition of roles, and subject matter experts, and decision making processes, where the buyer is now all of a sudden removed from the end user. And where those things start to separate is usually where the self-serve motion tends to stop working really well. And so what you have to do once you figure out you\'ve reached that point of ultimate decision maker and end user are now separate, is start thinking about how are we going to go to these decision makers, outbound after them and get their attention and interest in, and tell them why they should start thinking about us. And also the way you market, the look and feel of your company. B2C Marketing is very different, it\'s much more user-focused than B2B. And then, the same can be said for more SMB, Mid-Marketing Marketing focus, and Product Marketing in general, and brand, are very different than Enterprise. And if you go and look at companies, you can see this where, with an SMB mid-market you\'re still closer to the end user. So you can be more playful. Like your messaging is more playful. People are more willing to take risks, there\'s less, there\'s less cost for picking, the wrong solution, right? The deal sizes are smaller, the deal cycles are less. And ultimately, if someone makes a mistake it\'s okay, and you can kind of move on. Whereas you start getting into these larger companies with a lot of legacy technology and systems, it\'s going to be very challenging to switch something on in their environment, and get the adoption you want at a smaller company. And so the risk is much higher. And so therefore also, the education around how you\'re going to make them successful, the trust you need to build with them, is much different. And what I always found interesting from Dropbox and Intercom was trying to figure out the timing of how fast you move up market. And there\'s no great scientific way to go about it. Anyone tells you that if you\'re at the science, I just think they\'re lying to you. There\'s an art to it, of trying to figure how quickly you can move your Product up to larger companies and win them in a repeatable way. And then also, what are the one off really large companies that you\'re willing to go way up market for to win, knowing it\'s going to take all ton of your resources and time to make them successful. And there you\'re gonna have to set the right expectations with them around what your Product can and can\'t do in the short term. They\'re going to want to have a very heavy hand in your roadmap, and you\'ve gotta be willing to hear them out on that. But trying to figure the timing of, how quickly can you take a certain Product and a team up market because the Sales motion is different. So there\'s a lot of education of your Sales team and training to get them ready for that. Many times you\'re hiring in a different profile, as you\'re moving more market, of Sales rep. The way you do lead generation is very different. You go from a lot more online webinars to live events and industry events, right? All of a sudden you\'re doing things like talking to analysts, like Gartner and Forrester and those things are really important. Your up-market, large buyers, there\'s just so much more risk associated to them making the wrong decision. And so there\'s just so much education you need to do to make them successful. And so like I always love trying to figure out like how fast you can move up-market and that\'s the kind of experience I had, at both those companies. The thing I would say I learned from both experiences is, you have to really know your segments, really define your customers, and what the different customers will look like over time as you move up market. And you have to do a ton of upfront research for your larger potential customers around what the Product has to look like, and what feature and functionality you must have, if not immediately, in the near term in order to make them successful and for you to be very credible. So I would say the biggest lesson I learned there, is you have to know your Product inside and out, and know its capabilities and its shortcomings, so that you can accurately wedge in and figure out how quickly can we move up market. And then in terms of working cross functionally, how willing is our Product partners to move up market and to build these types of things that larger companies will just need, just to gain entry into them. And so like really developing those relationships and having lots of R&D conversations where you\'re talking about feature functionality and roadmap. And really aligning to what are the things we\'re going to build and in what order, that\'ll help us move up market. And if you\'re very close to your Product team, and you guys have a good understanding of what you need to build and over what time period, that will then inform how quickly you can move up market and take on larger potential customers. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Love it. So we\'re on Dropbox right now. You\'ve talked about a bunch of your experiences that transcend the companies you\'ve worked at. So one quick question that actually, how do you make sure...so one of the biggest parts of this is making sure that you have a closed loop process, and a closed loop feedback system for Product. How do you make sure you do that from a Sales leader perspective? What does that stakeholder relationship look like? And kind of what\'s the cadence there? David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Oh, that\'s a topic I can talk about for a long time. This is something I learned the hard way at Dropbox. Cause I would say I set myself back by thinking about it wrong early days. So, you have to realize that when you move into a role, at a certain stage, your idea of your teams changes the order of priority changes. And so this idea of like different teams. So there\'s the company team, there\'s your peer team, and then there\'s your team that you\'re responsible for. And you actually need to focus on developing relationships in that order. And also your decision making process has to, has to be in that order. So you have to ultimately, first and foremost as a senior leader, I don\'t care what your role is you have to do is right for the company, right? And for your customers. Even if that means, pushing back or deprioritizing things, that short term would be really beneficial to you and to your team. Right? You have to nail that. And if you don\'t, you\'re going to have a very short stay at on the Executive team. The second thing is you have to realize your second team is your peers. It\'s your cross functional partners, and they actually come before your team that you\'re directly responsible for. And that\'s a weird thing to say. And if you haven\'t been in that role yet, pay attention to it and you\'ll get, you\'ll feel what I\'m talking about. And at some point in your career where your number one priority is understanding the motivations and the priorities of your partners in Marketing, and Product, in recruiting, really every function in the company, and that\'s your first team, and you need to support all of them. Even if it comes at deep Productizing things that would be important for your team and your team is shouting for, you have to support each other. And so when I learned early from the Dropbox experience, that carried over more successfully to my Intercom experience would be, make sure you are just very clear on your intentions, and why you have the beliefs that you do, and develop strong relationships built around trust with your partners. You need them to understand your motivations behind the things you\'re asking for, or that you are lobbying for with them. You\'re not always gonna see eye to eye on the roadmap, as an example. Or, from a Marketing perspective, the qualification criteria for opportunities. Or where you should be investing your SEM and SEO dollars. And so you need to know first and foremost that you\'re here to help them and make them successful. And you have to show them, through your actions, that you\'re willing to put their priorities and their interests ahead of your own teams. And so if you do that really well, you\'ll get to a place of like deep understanding of each other, and a good working relationship. And so, like I said, I said to myself back by coming in and kind of guns blazing and a little too aggressive in Dropbox, and I kinda came in a little too aggressive and it was like, we need to build this, then this, then this. And they were kind of like, Hi, yeah, I\'m sorry, what\'s your name? You\'ve been here for what a minute. So I didn\'t realize that there was a lot of work I needed to do there. And fortunately I was able to rebuild those relationships over time there, but it helped me get off to a faster start at Intercom. And so, so much of it is like how are we going to focus on the roadmap that I think is going to be the most beneficial to our current and future customers. And so you have to approach this as a partnership and ask them what type of input they want from you. You have to make sure that you have an input in their roadmap process. And I learned quickly that R and d teams are much more interested in hearing about problems to be solved versus solutions. Don\'t tell a PM or Head of R&D, Hey, I think this is what we should build. Like, that\'s not going to go well for you ever. But talk about customers. Ultimately all of us are passionate about our customers and want to see them be really successful. And no Product hears when the Product they have is painful to their customer, and not doing what they needed to do. And so get out of the way, and let the voice of your customer just come through very strongly. In fact, take your R&D leaders if you can on road shows, and have them just meet with prospective customers, current customers, and former customers, and just get out of the way. Don\'t voice your opinion, just let the voice come through directly to them. and you\'ll have a much more engaged, and much more open to feedback, partner within R&D. Naber:\xa0 Love it. Excellent advice. Okay. moving into Intercom. Very natural transition and segue for us to leap into that. Why make the jump to Intercom? What were you responsible for? And I\'ve got one more topic for us to chat about before we wrap up David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So, I used to get this question a lot when I was interviewing people at Intercom as well, and it was foremost my boss. So I was very fortunate, to first meet a woman that you know, Laurabeth Harvey, goes by LB. LB and I worked at LinkedIn in a bunch of capacities. Naber:\xa0 Quick side story on this. I was LB\'s SD. Yes, that is how LB and my relationship started. I knew you love that. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That\'s so good. So yeah, so I was really fortunate to get to be exposed to and work with LB in a bunch of different capacities at my time together at LinkedIn. And then when I left, we stayed in touch. And if anything, our relationship got tighter. We would just start to compare notes, share war stories, I went to her for advice on a lot of things as I was trying to figure out what the heck I was doing at Dropbox. And I just always really respected her, and took so much away from every one of our conversations. Funny enough, like I had some catching up with her that, after eight incredible years at LinkedIn, she was starting to think about, potentially going and doing her own thing as a VP of Sales at an earlier stage company. And it just so happened that I had been reached out to by someone I knew at Intercom, who was doing the Executive search. And I was like...he started describing to me what he thought Intercom needed, and I was like, that\'s LB, that\'s my friend LB. I remember I immediately texted her and I\'m like, Hey, this guy\'s going to reach out to you. return his call. And one thing led to another. And I think literally within like a month, I was doing a reference call for LB with Owen, the CEO of Intercom. And so she joined. And I never would\'ve recommended she take that call if I didn\'t think that Intercom was an incredible Product, solving interesting problems, and like really on to something new, and nascent, and interesting. And so she joined, and then she spent the next couple of months trying to recruit me to come over. And pretty quickly her remit grew pretty substantially. She initially joined to lead direct Sales, and then for a number of reasons, she pretty quickly became responsible also for the customer support team globally, which was a pretty big team, as well as the self service business, and was responsible for the self-serve revenue as well. And so all of a sudden she had a lot more responsibility and it was like, I really need someone to come help me with this direct Sales component of this. And I was like, well, that sounds fun. I\'ve only ever managed, led, and built Account Executive teams, and I\'ve really only ever done it in North America. And so to have an opportunity to come in be responsible for the full stack, so to speak, of building a commercial team, from Sales Development, to Account Executives to, Account Managers, and success Managers, and Sales engineers, and getting to build new offices, and new countries, which is like too cool an opportunity to pass up. And to get to do it with a cool company with someone that I loved and respected, and had worked with previously, I was like, how can I not do this? So it wasn\'t really that, I felt my time had come to an end at Dropbox. It was more like, this is too cool of a thing to pass up. And they didn\'t fight me on it. I think when I laid out to my former boss at Dropbox why I was going to do it, he was kind of like, yeah, that sounds pretty awesome man. I\'m gonna miss you man, and good luck. Naber:\xa0 Very cool. LB amazing for so many reasons. so I love that story. I love the transition, and thanks for talking about, what you\'re responsible for. The last topic I want to talk to you about is best practices for building and maintaining those functions. You\'ve had an interesting, spectrum that for in firsthand managing, all these different types of teams. Most the time people either inherit them or we\'ll take on one at a time. You have firsthand and frontline managed, and ultimately managed leaders of, all these different teams. So let\'s hop through them, and just talk about maybe one or two best practices for building and managing that team and the mindset you should have. and that\'s the last topic I want to talk about. So Sales Development, one or two best practices for building and managing those teams. So Sales Development, Account Executives, Account Managers, success Managers and Sales engineers. Sales Development first. One or two best practices as well as a mindset you should have when building and managing those teams. David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So, and this kind of applies to all roles. I\'ll take a half step back is, at some point in our careers you get to a place where you\'re responsible for things that you are not an expert in whatsoever. And that can be kind of scary, but like embrace it because it\'s true of anyone. Like you\'re going to get to a level where you\'re like, yeah, I have no idea how this thing works, but I\'m now responsible for it. And it\'s an exciting and terrifying proposition. And so the first thing I would say is, that\'s okay. You\'re not alone. And everyone gets to a point in their kind of journey and career where they ultimately might have that situation. So the best thing to do in that situation is, hire people who know what the hell they\'re doing. The first thing I would say is, and this is what\'s really scalable, and it\'s surprising cause it seems so simple, but so many companies get this wrong from my, my experience, is hire in really senior leaders that will scale and build that function for you. And so really make sure, like, this is what I did when I started building out a Sales engineering team at Intercom. You know, I had worked with Sales engineers, I knew what a great Sales engineering partner looks like, but I didn\'t know how to build that function. I didn\'t know what the right KPIs were. I didn\'t know what the right comp plans were. Like, I had no idea. And I was fortunate to have some friends that led those functions that I could rely on early days, and be like, all right, what the heck do I do here? Like, how does this work? But the sooner you can go and just hire us subject matter expert in, who\'s an incredible leader, who\'s probably overqualified for the role in the short term, convincing them to come onboard is the right thing to do because that person will scale that, not function for you. So that would be my first piece of advice is like, you\'re going to find a certain situation, like go hire an expert. And then just trust them. Like, let them run, create a framework for them, but just to let them go and do their thing. And if you\'ve hired really well, like you\'re going to be fine. So that\'s what I would say. But back specifically to Sales Development. Like what are you looking for? Again, I would focus more on the leaders then, versus the reps and individual contributors. So I would think about what are the really important skill sets you need for these different roles for frontline or Manager of experience. To me, Sales Development is operational excellence. You need math whizzes. Like I think there\'s obviously an art to it, but there\'s also science, and you need data junkies. Like you really want leaders who love looking at conversion rates, open rates, response rates, measuring every little piece of the funnel, and the top of the funnel, and also really have an interest in Marketing, and Digital Marketing, and can develop strong working relationships with your Marketing partners. Like focus on people who look and feel like that, have that expertise, and they\'ll really help you scale that function. For Account Executives, it\'s not to say that operational excellence isn\'t still really important, but I would say look for very strong coaches. I think the mistake a lot of people make is they hire people who are really high performing in their own right as individual contributors and as reps. And like, I just don\'t think that translates often into people who are going to be amazing leaders. So you need to focus on finding people who are like exceptional coaches, really good listeners, very situationally aware, have very high emotional intelligence and self-awareness, and are very strong when it comes to hiring. You can test for all those things when you\'re interviewing people. But for AE\'s, and also for that matter, for Account Managers, that\'s who you need. You need really amazing coaches. And that\'s the areas I would focus on, those leaders, in your early days, is look for those softer skills and those people will be very successful. As long as you\'re getting the right guidance. For Customer Success and for Sales Engineering, they\'re more technical roles. And so you also now are looking for people who have a strong affinity for, and love for Product. And kind of geek out on Product, and they\'re builders, and they\'re tinkerers in their own right. And those are things that you see come through in their experience, and things they like to spend their time doing outside of work. And so I think, you need to look for people who are very biased towards Product, and working closely with Product, geek out on it, and are very excited about it. And blend that together with like an amazing ability to be good coaches and be strong people leaders. And if you look for those things across the different functions, you\'re gonna do well, and you\'ll be successful. And you\'ll also be more confident that you can be outside of your bounds of experience, and that those people are going to be doing the right things. I think something I see people do all the time is, when they hire people into disciplines where that\'s not their area of experience, their domain, their just like so paranoid about it, and they spend way too much time worrying about whether or not, are we doing the right things? Is this person really good? Is Our team really good? It\'s like, no. Define on paper and get feedback from others on what you\'re looking for, make sure you\'re clear on the on the skills you want in that leader, but then just them, let them run and do their thing. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. I have one more - what I think is a quick question - around, picking companies. You\'ve done an amazing job, and this is a good transition for your move to Tessian, you\'ve just gone through this process recently. You\'ve done an amazing job of picking great businesses to work with at the right time, for both your experience, as well as what you can stretch and learn on, as you grow into the scope of the role and as you take it on. What are some of your career navigation and picking company best practices or tips that you have for doing the same? David Katz:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 So first and foremost, look to the team. And if you are considering joining an early stage company as the VP of Sales, or in any leadership capacity, first and foremost, it\'s the team. And I think the older you get, the more experience you have, the more you know what\'s personally important to you. And I think what you\'re solving for later in life is more, the people I\'m working with and for, do they have the same philosophical beliefs and values that I have? That\'s what I would tell you to look for first and foremost. Do these people believe in the similar things and put the same weight on things are just like so important to me. And I tell them all the time, like the older I get, the fewer things really matter to me, but the things that do matter me matter exponentially more. And so really you start getting a sense of what are your core things you must have. And you can start asking and testing for those. So first and foremost, I would say that. Second then is, it depends on what you\'re going for, but if you like playing this crazy game of high growth company like, you want to be doing it at a company that has like massive upside. Like, I think it\'s silly to say that anyone who\'s joining as an Executive at an earlier stage company isn\'t financially motivated. Like, I want this thing to be big. I have very meaningful equity and I want to see that come to fruition for me and for my family. And so like you need to find places where you actually think that company has a chance. And so I think what you\'re looking for is big market opportunity. Like don\'t look for niche companies, look for companies that can sell their Products or Services to massive audiences. Second, the Product or service has to be something that is like to you when you hear it and you learn about it, like this is so straight forward, why is no one ever done this before? Like, anytime I\'ve felt that way, that\'s when I made a career decision. And that was true at Dropbox, Intercom, and Tessian. It\'s kind of like, this seems so simple. Why has no one done this? And then you start digging in, you realize like, oh, this is really hard. But if you have an initial reaction, this is so simple, why haven\'t we done this? Like this seems such like such an obvious problem to solve. Then you\'re on to the right thing. And the last thing I would say is look for problems to be solved, not for feature functionality. The way you go to market, and the way that Product is sold will change and morph so much as you learn more about how\'s this going to resonate in the market? But like, if the Executive team that you\'re joining is focused on what problems they\'re looking to solve, and you believe that that\'s a big market opportunity to solve those problems, that no one\'s really done that before, or these are just new problems with the evolution of technology and the way we work, and that these are just new problems that need to be solved, that no one\'s thought about them yet. Like, then you\'re probably on this something. And so that\'s the last thing I would say, and the plug I would say for Tessian, is when I met Tim and Ed, our cofounders - our CEO and CTO - I was blown away by them. And I realized like, we just saw the world very similarly in terms of our values, and the things that informed our decision making, and what we were willing to make concessions on and what we weren\'t. And I just was like, so blown away by them and could really envision working well with them. And because if you\'re joining company this stage, like there\'s going to be times where you\'re celebrating, there\'s gonna be times when you\'re banging your head against the wall being like, what do we do now? And it\'s going to be hard. And you really want to feel as you\'re coming in as the VP of Sales, that you\'re going to be supported. And that you guys are in this together, and that you\'re going to work together through the hard times and figure things out. And if you don\'t feel that way, keep looking. That would be my final advice. Naber:\xa0 Hey everybody, thanks so much for listening. If you appreciated and enjoyed the episode, go ahead and make a comment on the post for the episode on LinkedIn.

Jennifer Knight: I\'m doing well. Thank you for having me. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Thank you for coming. It\'s amazing to have you. I\'m excited for so many reasons. we know each other well and we\'ve worked together in the past. But your brain, and getting to share that with people in the audience is really exciting for me. it\'s hard for me to contain some of the excitement with my emotions. But, I\'m excited to go through some personal stuff today. So go through and dive into who Jenn is as a person. Start from where you grew up, and some stuff from your childhood. So people can get to know you a little better, like I do. And then, we\'ll hop into some professional stuff. Why don\'t we just get started. So, you grew up in San Francisco, you\'re smarty pants. Anyone that has met you for more than a minute knows that, but it\'s written in you DNA as well as your GPA, as well as your accolades. Walk us through, a few different things about what Jenn was like as a kiddo, and what it was like growing up with as Jenn Knight. Jennifer Knight: Well, I grew up north of San Francisco, in Sonoma County, in Petaluma, which was a ton of fun. It has changed a lot now, but in the early nineties, it was very rural still. Get on your bike, ride into a field, find some mice, hang out. I was a pretty nerdy little kid. I grew up in a house that didn\'t have a TV. My Dad is an engineer, so we were always puttering on things. He had a garage full of tools, and we\'re always being taught new things. I was always encouraged to be outside or around. Got a computer pretty early, which was neat. My brother and I, very nerdy, would love to do things like see how many files we could delete to destroy the operating system, and then rebuild the thing. Built a few computers growing up, but really enjoyed that part of life. Yeah, I was a kid who had a little bit of a different experience growing up just because of the nature of my house. And spent lot of time outside, and a lot of time building and poking on computers, and just hanging out. Naber:\xa0 Cool. Were you a particularly social kid? Jennifer Knight: That\'s a funny question. I always had good friends, a few good friends. I think I\'m still that way. I\'m someone who finds people that resonate with me and I keep a few close. I really enjoy the company of others, but I\'ve always been someone who has had two or three really close friends, than whole big group. And growing up I had to change schools in middle school. And so at 12 years old I had to move across to a school across town. And that taught me one that you can make new friends but was pretty scary I think at the time. So you get close to people in elementary school and then didn\'t get a chance to stay friends with those people. I had to make new friends at 12, which was great in the sense of it taught me that you can, and you can survive. But it definitely meant that I had a few folks that I kept close. Naber:\xa0 Cool. I like it. A small, very close circle. And you said you were always building things, or tinkering, and having some nerdy fun. Tell us about a little bit of the nerdy, fun hobbies that had. Jennifer Knight: I think, I actually laugh when I look back on this...A very good example of this is my fourth grade science project was about different forms of energy, and it was about potential versus kinetic energy and the conversion. So my Dad had me worked with me to solder a little, wind mill thing that was powered by candles. That might give you a good picture of what my house is like. And then we did things like gardening. That was always fun in the summer. Petaluma was a great place to grow a garden in the backyard, so my parents did that. Just those kinds of projects. Those are the ones I remember the most, I think partially because you get pictures of them, and they\'re the stories that get told. But there were always a million little things we were playing around with. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Cool. Love it. That\'s great. And let\'s see, quick stop on high school. What was high school like for you? Jennifer Knight: High School was a lot of fun. I wanted to get out of Petaluma. I knew that that wasn\'t where I wanted to be, and I knew I wanted to go somewhere for college. In my family education was really important. So, all growing up it was, you\'re going to go to school, you\'re going to do well. You\'re gonna learn a lot. You\'re capable of learning a lot. You\'re very smart. Put your head down and learn. Go get opportunity. So that was just the ethos of my growing up. One thing I will say is my parents were not obsessed with grades, they didn\'t push me to be perfect. I weirdly pushed myself, and at some point they were like, you need to calm down a bit. But high school was a lot of fun. I had a really close, like once again, handful of very close friends. We all encouraged each other to go after where we wanted to go next. Really great study groups. It was also for me a hard time. My Mom was sick when I was growing up, and she got really sick again when I was about 16. So that was hard at home. My parents dealt with it really well, but I had the mix of trying to be the kid who was studying and then dealing with some things at home. So I think once again, close knit group of friends is really important for me because they were people that I could lean on and really knew what was happening in my life at. And the rest of it, was just getting through it. Naber:\xa0 Interesting. Some things a lot of kids that age don\'t necessarily have to deal with obviously. So you wanted to get out of Petaluma, but you were trying to be perfect so you could have all the opportunities in the world to do that and chase your dreams. Your dreams brought you to Beantown Boston. So tell us about going to BU. Tell us about why, and what were like at BU. Jennifer Knight: Yeah, so, my parents had saved a bit for us to go to school, but couldn\'t go anywhere. So one of the reasons that studying was really important for me, was ultimately getting scholarships, and getting the opportunity to go to school. And I actually went to Boston site unseen. I\'d never been there. I didn\'t know anything about the school. Yeah, it was funny. So they reached out to me, and they offered me a really amazing scholarship, and it actually brought the price of the college down to closer to what a UC would be for me. And so I was making a decision whether to stay in California, or go somewhere else, and my parents were very open to encouraging me to try something new. My Dad said...he always jokes that I was running away from them. He said to me, "Leave California now. If you don\'t like it, wherever you go, you can always come back. But if you don\'t leave now, you may never actually leave the state, and and you may not see what the rest of the world\'s like." So, I accepted to BU, and I had a choice for my parents to come with me for orientation or to help me move in. So my Dad came with me for orientation, and that was the first time I saw saw the school and saw Boston. Naber:\xa0 That\'s a very Jenn Knight thing to do. You\'re so adventurous and fearless. I love the courage and the fearlessness. It\'s cool. It\'s a good example. Jennifer Knight: Looking back on it, it\'s funny, I think I was mildly terrified. But I really wanted to study international relations, and or something along that, and the UC schools that I was looking at only had international economics, and I\'m more interested in people problems than technical problems actually. So BU had an amazing international relations school, and that was ultimately what encouraged me to go. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. And international relations. And you also studied French in for a year in France, correct? Jennifer Knight: I did, yeah. So I was a international relations major. Foreign Policy and Security in the Middle East was the focus of my studies, but I also did a minor in French. Naber:\xa0 What was your experience like in France? Jennifer Knight: It was an amazing experience. Once again, it\'s a different time now. At that time there were cell phones, but not really. There was internet, but not really. I didn\'t have a laptop with me that could connect to the internet very often. So it was an interesting experience at 19 to get on a plane and fly all the way across the world, and then get a calling card and get on a pay phone at seven o\'clock at night to call your family, to handle the time zone difference. I was ready in that I had studied French in high school. I was also not ready in that I had not studied it for a semester before I went. But I had an a pretty incredible experience on my way over there. Being from the West Coast, the program that my school ran didn\'t actually coordinate my flights because they coordinated everything for kids on the east coast. So once again, I was put on a plane, and my parents said good luck. And when I landed in Paris, I had no idea that Charles de Gaulle was kind of a mess. I was running through the airport. and I saw the group that I was eventually gonna study with being guided through the airport by an adult. And I was running for a gate, to miss my flight. But I got to the gate, and right behind me showed up a woman who\'s about my age, and she had actually been studying English and in the US during the summer. And I had no idea what to do. And she just grabbed ahold of me, and she took me to the ticket table, and she handled everything. And we went to a different airport, got on a flight together to Leon. And then her parents drove me to Grenoble with her because they were going home. And it was totally surreal experience, but also one that I think back on a lot that the world is actually a very generous place, and it\'s a very kind place often, if you\'re open to it. And I know it has its rough edges, but at a young age being able to travel over there and see that people are people across the world, and people are willing to help, was really incredible start to the journey. And that things don\'t always go perfectly, but they will end well, was something that was fun. And then it was a crash course in trying to navigate another culture, which I\'ve always looked back on and really appreciated what the program gave me. So it was a fun year. Naber:\xa0 Very cool. Good story too. Good story. I always feel better when I talk to you, Jenn. You keep such an optimistic, positive light. So you studied at BU. Walk us through your first couple of gigs, up until before LinkedIn, so up through Bluewolf, and let\'s do some hops. Explain it. Typically we go through a few different things within those gigs. What I want to do is get to LinkedIn, Dropbox, and Stripe and talk through a couple of examples, and some of your superpowers, and we\'ll get there. But anyways, why don\'t you hop us through just so we have a good understanding of where you came from professionally. Hop us through some of those gigs and what you\'re up to. Maybe in like maybe like five, seven minutes. Jennifer Knight: Yeah. Seeing as I studied a bunch in high school, I actually entered college as a sophomore, finishing in three and a half years because I took a bit of extra time to go to France. So I graduated actually December 2006. For family reasons with my Mom being sick, and not being very clear how long she was going to be doing well, I decided I wanted to come back to the west coast. I had the most useless degree on earth to come back to the west coast. There, there is very little to do with international relations with a focus on the Middle East in San Francisco Bay Area. So I came back had to figure out what I was going to do. And I ended up just on craigslist looking at jobs. That was the way back then, that and the newspaper. Which was 2007, and it sounds crazy, but that\'s the truth. LinkedIn was, I suppose, kind of a thing, but it was very, very small, not really a thing. It\'s just starting out. Right. Naber:\xa0 It had volume of users, but not a lot of density and a lot of engagement. So it\'s just less useful at that point. Jennifer Knight: Yeah. So I just applied, I mean, toeverything I could. And then I ended up getting a job as an Office Manager at a solar company in Berkeley. And I, with my college degree, went and answered the phones and opened to the mail. But it was the thing that afforded to me to get my first apartment, and my first foray out into the world. It was a great community of people. It was an opportunity for me to be in an environment where I could just see how I could help. And so I learned as much as I possibly could. I had a lot of fun working with the outsourced IT guys who would come in and help with the servers. And then, we hired a Director of IT, and he was a bit overwhelmed and he asked me if I wanted to help him Administer Salesforce, and so I started doing that. I was there for two and a half years. The company\'s split, part of it was sold off - the residential was sold off, stayed with industrial side, learned Salesforce development. I was quite lucky in that I became a Salesforce Administrator right before Salesforce opened up as a platform. And then my boss at the time taught me how to program on the platform. It\'s very similar to Java. Apex is Salesforce is language. So I got to iteratively roll into this platform as it was growing. And I was one of the first 500 administrators certified, which is very...I look back on it, and it\'s a nerdy moment in that...but just a good timing moment. So I was doing that, but I was pretty stuck. And after two and a half years, I was pretty burned out actually. When the company split, I was the only person doing my role. And I enjoyed a lot of my coworkers. I have, actually, one of my best friends from that job. But I just wasn\'t loving it anymore, and I was too tired actually to really look for what was next and know what I wanted to do next. So I decided to take six months off, and this was in 2008-2009. So everyone thought I was out of my mind. But I did, and it was really fun. I moved to San Francisco. I worked in nonprofit, so I actually did nonprofit work at, Salesforce nonprofit, at a women\'s community clinic and at an urban garden. So the women\'s community clinic in San Francisco and at the place that does urban gardening in Oakland. Helped them set up their Salesforce instances. The urban garden one was amazing. We use Salesforce to track plants, and pests, and tools, and acreage, and all sorts of crazy stuff that you wouldn\'t imagine. Yeah. So I did that, and when I moved to San Francisco, Craigslist again, my craigslist roommates - one worked at Salesforce as a Sales rep and one worked at Bluewolf as a Sales rep. And my roommate Chris, who worked at Bluewolf said, hey, we\'re looking for developers. I don\'t think you want a full time job right now, but do you want to come contract with us, and check it out? ...did some contract work, and then after probably four months I decided to join full time. And that was the first time...and one of the reasons I did it, that was the first time I got to figure out if I was any good. And when you do something alone, you have a sense like I knew I could make things work, I knew I could solve the problem, but I had never been around other Salesforce developers where people with technical backgrounds, to find out if I was actually good at it or not. And I had an amazing group of people and an amazing support system at Bluewolf to help me grow and some great mentors there. So I couldn\'t be more thankful for them. They were extremely patient as I was plotting through things, and then also threw me at some really, really tough challenges. So I was doing a lot of the development for west coast projects, by the time I left. Did that for about a year and a half...um, I am not a consultant. I love the design. I didn\'t love flying in, building something, and then leaving it. I also didn\'t love being on a plane all the time. So I hadn\'t really known that I was going to do with myself, but I put my profile up on LinkedIn, and then LinkedIn found me on LinkedIn. And that\'s how I ended up at LinkedIn. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Awesome. Okay. We\'ve got to LinkedIn. That\'s a really good story. You got to work on some, excellent cool projects, while you were trying to figure out your actual depth of your prowess around this new set of skills you were learning. But it\'s probably also really stimulating for you because you\'re such a smart person. You\'re also trying new things all the time, and wanting to build. So I\'m going to guess that was really stimulating to learn this whole new world of technical bricks that you could build with. Jennifer Knight: It was, it was a lot of fun. It also taught me that that skill set around Salesforce is something it can be really can be used anywhere. And it\'s something I talk about with my teams now. It\'s quite fun, and I think a lot of skills in a lot of different areas of the business are transferable, but if you want if you want to work at a small company, if you want to work at a big company, if you want to work in nonprofit, if you want to consult, there\'s kind of a home anywhere. And that is pretty liberating because you get to go pick your family, and pick where you want to be. Naber:\xa0 Cool. Love it. All right. So, give us a quick chronology of what your responsibilities were, and what you\'re up to at LinkedIn. And then I have a couple of questions for you to follow-up and dig into your brilliant mind a little bit. Jennifer Knight: So I joined LinkedIn as the first Salesforce developer, joined the team that was in existence. There were five at the time, and the were two of us who joined, myself and a woman who was also doing Salesforce administration at the same time. So we grew to a team of seven. I still work with today, one woman from that team. I could not be more thankful once again for what they taught me in terms of how to approach an environment and how to approach work, just work. I was the youngest by far, and I was coming down from San Francisco, and I\'d come from...Bluewolf was a really young environment as well. So that ethos of chaos, and running around, and experimenting, and trying new things, and to go from that to a place where people were far more measured, I hadn\'t seen that before. It was, yeah, we can do this. Like we\'re gonna think about it, we\'re gonna make a plan, and we\'re gonna go after it. It was really intense. We were building a ton, but it was very focused and measured. and it wasn\'t all over the map, and that was both due to the team that I had around me, and also a lot of the partners that we had at LinkedIn. So I joined as a developer, and then I helped grow out the Salesforce Technical Architecture and Development team over the course of my three years there. And so I was responsible at the end for our project work. We restructured the team, our lead structure the team as a Plan, Build, Run. So PMO, a business analyst doing the business requirements gathering, build was my responsibility - so those were the big project work, and then run was kind of the day to day administration, and keeping the lights on, minor enhancements, things like that. My team would do both technical development, but also if there was a administrative component of configuration, we might partner with an Admin to do that. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Very cool. One of the questions I have for you, and this is actually a good segue into that...you had a lot of experiences, at a lot of different teams, also built a lot of differe teams with LinkedIn, Dropbox, Stripe. You can go across those if you need to to pull experiences. But, is that the typical anatomy of a Internal Business Systems and Tools team? Or, if it\'s not, what is the typical anatomy, and can you give us a little bit of a breakdown? Jennifer Knight: Yeah. So those functions are the three behaviors that you see across the board. Alex, who\'s my Manager at Dropbox, said way back in the day...it\'s people, process, technology. And that is true always. So do you have the partner, does the partner know how their processes articulated? Do you understand how to reinforce, and support, or automate, or speed up, or whatever you\'re trying to achieve, that process with technology? And then there\'s the iterative, like, continuing to keep that alive and continuing to improve it. I think about the world in that framing all of the time now, that\'s how we approach it. And so our team is staffed for each of those areas. The plan side is always about, let\'s sit down with the people we\'re partnering with, and let\'s understand their process. Now that team on my team is responsible for really understanding the business partners\' process, and then starting to think about who do we need to engage with from the technology side to support that process? Then the build side is the actual team that\'s saying, okay, now I\'ve got the process. How do we empower this with the tools we have? Or what tools do we need to go buy? And run, of course, being the day to day maintenance. Those functions always exist. They are not always carved out as specific teams because depending on size, you just don\'t have the resources. When I joined LinkedIn, each one of us was a little mini plan, build, run. There were only seven of us, and we were supporting a lot. And so we would go sit down, and get the requirements, and then we would go off, and going to build something, and then you\'re the one who kept it alive. And and then eventually when you got a little bit burned out on that area, you\'d switch it to one of your other team members. So I ended up with Sales Development work because April was done thinking about that problem...and then we\'ve cycled through. But those, those pillars exist. They just evolve. And how you structure the team varies quite a bit. There is not a perfect way to do that. I think it depends a lot about where the organization is, what they\'re valuing at the time, and then who do you have on staff. But the core behaviors that remain the same across LinkedIn, Dropbox and Stripe. Naber:\xa0 Okay. That\'s awesome. That\'s a really good answer. Thank you so much. And while we\'re on LinkedIn, can you explain,what LinkedIn does extremely well from a Systems, Tools, Building leverage resources? And when you do that, could you lean into some of the things you do really well within the respect of Sales and Marketing? Because I think the audience is going to want to want to understand each one of these businesses, both what they were good at, why that\'s important, and how do they do it? Jennifer Knight: Yeah. So it\'s been a few years since I was there, so I\'m sure it\'s evolved. But one of one of the overarching things that I remember from that time is actually just Focus. I think LinkedIn did very well...and as a partner to it, I appreciated it a lot after I left. There\'s always thrash. Nothing\'s perfect, the business evolves. Part of my responsibility is to be flexible enough to accommodate the fact that business has changed. They chart a course, but it\'s not like...Product Development is exactly the same way. Factors change and they can change fairly rapidly. And so the needs of the business can change fairly rapidly. That said, knowing more now and seeing, having seen different environments, in the face of that, I\'d say LinkedIn did very well on remaining focused and what the core objectives that they were trying to enforce were. And then systematizing those. And maybe doing some experiments on the edges of other like creative things that we could potentially do to drive the business, but making sure that we were focused on being excellent at a few things, doing those very well, and those being backbone things for the business. So it was the first time that I had to work on some of the end to end workflows around Demand Gen. And how do you think about that, and how are you optimizing that? And not about a lot of bells and whistles and not always about crazy experimentation. It was first let\'s get it right. We have a core business objective, and the objective is not changing. It\'s reduce the time to touch. Okay, let\'s go like nail that one to the wall. And then once we get that one done, we\'ll be find the next one, and we\'ll like nail that one down. And those are the focus areas that don\'t change, right? Even if your approach changes, or your markets change, they\'re just really core parts of how you want to operate a business. So that was something LinkedIn did very well. One of the reasons that I left LinkedIn though, on the system side, is that at the time that I was there we were very silo\'d. So we had a lot of autonomy in the space that we operated in, in partnership with our Sales ops partners. But some processes are actually cross business units. And some Systems work best when they\'re integrated across. A good example of this is a CRM to Oracle. A CRM to an ERP. So Salesforce to Oracle, or Salesforce to Netsuite, or I mean, no one uses anything besides Salesforce. That\'s not entirely true, but, Dynamics to SAP, any of those. Those flows were something that were interesting to me, and I didn\'t have the opportunity to work on as much. We could influence it. We could encourage. We couldn\'t work on it as much. When I got to Dropbox, that was the first place that I was able to think about end-to-end flows. And that was an area...because I had the autonomy to go own those. So that was an area...I think LinkedIn did very well on the focus, focus in depth in a particular system space. But we struggled a bit on the cross Systems, from where I was sitting. This is not a universal picture, but but from where I was sitting. So when I moved to Dropbox, I got the opportunity to think more cross platform, and that helped smooth some of the edges across teams, which was a lot of fun. At Dropbox we were in a bit of a different mode, so we were doing a lot of crazy growth. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. This is good. This is a good transition. So ell us what you\'re doing with Dropbox. Jennifer Knight: So I joined there to do Sales Systems. It was still really early days. We were still hiring out our Sales operations team. And so, I at that point, learned the importance of the people process part. When you put technology first, it it proves to be a bit of a challenge. That one was...I learned a lot more about meeting my business partners where they were. I actually leaned more into some of the operations and business analyst part of my role. That was not what I was doing at LinkedIn, but at Dropbox by necessity, you\'re saying there\'s these three functions, I was doing plan and build and run. And as I hired my team out, I hired them to do run first, and then started building from there, so that I could figure out what the needs of the business were, and then try to make some educated decisions around what we were going to invest in on the technology side. We had a ton of fun and we were building from scratch. There are things at LinkedIn, even by the time I was there, that had become so complicated that you kinda didn\'t want to touch them. When I got to Dropbox, it was the first time I got to build an order to cash process. And had amazing partner, who was also new. He had never built it before, and he was coming from the finance side. And he was really passionate about making this a really amazing experience for people. And so we just partnered really closely together to make that happen and thought about how we did it end to end. We ended up over the course of probably two years, building a flow that I\'m still very proud of, but it was very focused on these business objectives again. We wanted the experience of someone who was buying Dropbox through a contract, from a provisioning perspective, to mirror the experience of someone who was buying with a credit card. And that was our goal. So we set that as our goal, and then we also set a goal that along the way that we had as smooth as possible process with the Sales team, so that there was a lot of transparency about what was happening. Contracting, as some of you know, can be very complicated from the Sales side because there are legal people coming in, there\'s financial approvals, there is these multistep processes, and it can feel like it\'s taking forever and you have no idea what\'s going on. And then maybe the thing is signed, and now you don\'t know why your customer hasn\'t been given the Product because it\'s fallen into another manual process where someone has to go into some backend system. Or in the case of, and this was happening when I got there, you as a Sales rep now have to go into some backend system that you maybe don\'t fully understand and punch a bunch of buttons, and then hope that everything works out, and that your customer gets the Product they want. So we started once again with that focus, and we were really successful there. And those kinds of activities were the things that made my team successful. When we could find those focus areas, through our rapid growth, those are long pull items. They take a long time to get right, and if we kept focused on it, we were able to drive impact. So we were really...I brought that from LinkedIn, that focus in our space. Naber:\xa0 Hey Jenn, can we pause there for a minute?0 So let\'s use the order to cash process that you built. Can you walk us through the phases you go through to build the case for it, plan out the project, resource and manage the project, you\'ve got to have Internal buy-in, then you\'ve got to have pull through for people, actually making sure that they do what they need to do in the field and the business? Can you walk us through using that as an example for number one, what the steps are? And number two, from a Sales and Marketing or just really from a stakeholder perspective, what are some of the best practices in working with your team so that we can be better at doing that? As you go through it. Jennifer Knight: Yeah, so, let\'s break it down. How do we approach it? So now, one of the things that I think a lot about when I\'m approaching these types of projects is how do we think about, an ask, and it\'s end to end? So one of the things about working with a Systems team is that we\'re ultimately accountable for the overall health of the Systems. And it\'s an interesting process for us to understand what a business is asking for. And then trying to put that in the context of either another set of business asks or the platform on the whole. And we also have situations where, there are multiple stakeholders. And order to cash is a good example of one. Demand Gen flows is another good example of that. Where as a business owner, or as maybe a Sales Manager, you\'re saying, in your inner mind thinking, it\'s taking too long for my teams to get contracts out the door. And then on the other side, the finance Systems team is thinking, like, I need to be able to ensure that this contract has the correct margins, or is feeling good about that. And the legal team is sitting there thinking like, what are these contracts terms? Let\'s make sure that those make sense for the business. So when we get these asks, part of what we think about on the more complicated asks, but even on the smaller ones, is who are all the players in this ask? What is it in the context of the larger process flow? And what is it in the context of the larger Systems? And that\'s something that I\'ve had the opportunity to do a lot, and something I quite enjoy is how do we put this in, frame it out, and where it wants to be. The other thing that we need to do on our side, is thinking about how we get from point A to point B? And can we do it in one shot, or to your point, does it have to be a multistep process? And some of these things are quite complex, and so we\'re not going to win it all at once. So for us, starting with that problem statement and then working through with our business partners to get an alignment on the overall problem statement, what we ultimately want to achieve, and then agreeing on how do we iteratively get there. So what are interim wins along the way, or something that we benefit from, and we benefit from that partnership. In terms of resourcing and implementing a thread...I\'d say it varies wildly depending on your circumstances. And Systems tends to be lagging behind the business. I have yet to be an environment where we weren\'t coming in two, or three, or four, six years late. It\'s just the nature of it. I think SaaS has this sheen on top of it, where you\'re just oh, I can just get a Salesforce account and probably have one person manage it, and it\'s going to be okay. Like it\'s easy, right? And actually, that\'s not wrong for a period of growth. But then when you start to get into these more complicated asks , or you start to get into Architecture questions, or you start to need to do development, then that tool becomes something quite serious to take charge of, and you need a team that is dedicated to it and experienced. I talked to folks about this a lot, where there\'s a whole period of time where you really just go experiment, like try to find your way. You don\'t need to hire a technical architect, and a full team, and everything right out the gate. But as your business starts to take off, and you start to have those needs, having an experienced person, who\'s seen it before, come in can really help you figure out what you want to navigate over the course of the next two years. So I think the resourcing thing, it\'s very varied. But if you want to tackle a more complex workflow, or you want to really empower a part of your business, that\'s the point where you start to think about these dedicated resources. And that\'s when I\'m looking at it...for my team, when I come in, I look...survey the landscape. What are our biggest challenges? What do we want to think about? And what are our business partners talking about? What aren\'t they talking about that is probably going to doom us anyway. And then how do we line those up, and what kinds of resources do I need? Do I need a lot of business analysts? I might need a lot of business analysts right out the gate because I may need to spend time helping the business articulate their ask. That actually is a weird one. Often I work with business partners, and they\'re like, where\'s where\'s the admin? And where\'s the developer? And I\'m saying, well those are execution folks and you want a partner right now is going to help you think through your process, and then make sure that we\'re reinforcing the right behaviors. So I\'m going to actually get business analysts to define that. And then once we have those definitions, we have a bunch of different levers we can pull in terms of execution. I personally enjoy building teams that are really dedicated to the business. So we always have a mix of technical and BA full time on the team. Most of our projects, the big ones take 12, 18, 24 months. So you really want someone who is excited about the end to end and will build the continuity. But there are amazing, I worked for one, they\'re amazing partners who will come in and help you with resourcing. And we also pull that lever a lot on our team. But we do it in the context of making sure that we have the business requirements anchored, and we know what we\'re going after. S to kind of rewind back to your question to how we approach these things. What\'s important for us is understanding what we\'re solving, and being able to really work with the business to understand what their objective is. And if it\'s a project where we know it\'s going to take more than a quarter of more than a month to go after, making sure that that objective is something that is very solid. And that\'s what I was talking about earlier. Your objective being speed to lead, your objective being speed to contract...there\'s those kinds of objectives where even as time passes, we\'re going to keep after that. So we feel successful together over the course of the year or two it takes, and that we can measure our progress against it. The failure modes that I\'ve seen is when we don\'t know what we\'re solving for and instead we get the kind of partnership where it\'s, I need this field, I need this thing. I\'ve already solved it for you, justt go build it. We can do that. The probability that it will ultimately build into the kind of system or process that we both want together, is not super high end. On the margin, it\'s okay. We\'ll put in a field, we\'\'ll kind of get going. We are here to empower and enable the business. And that\'s something that I talk about with my teams quite a bit. Like, our responsibility is to empower the business, and so we should understand where they\'re coming from and then try to get them there. Ideally we do it in partnership, and process, and Solution design. Sometimes we just have to crank. Naber:\xa0 Cool. So that was awesome. That was an awesome answer. I love it. It\'s almost like you read it out of a book, so, and maybe you wrote the book. So, one more question, and then we\'ll move on to Stripe because you already gave an example with the order to cash and that was great. Actually, two more questions. You mentioned a couple things that Dropbox was doing well, but what\'s the one thing you think they do extremely well from a Business Systems, Internal Business Systems, Business Systems and tools, leverage resources that they\'re building, etc. What\'s one thing they do world-class? Why is it important? And how did they do it? Jennifer Knight: An interesting question. Naber:\xa0 I mean, LinkedIn was focus, if you had to say it in a few words, Dropbox is obviously world-class at a few things. Jennifer Knight: So what I would say, and it was very different in its approach. When I got there, like I said, I started to do Sales Systems, and I got to grow in my role and pick up other teams. And so that\'s where I learned about Finance Systems, and ended up taking that over and building that. I\'d say, maybe the flip side of what I was experiencing in terms of rigidity at LinkedIn, Dropbox had an environment where if you wanted to go tackle a problem ,and you could rally your resources around it, and you could get get the team together, we can go tackle the problem. And that was super, super fun. Obviously from a system side, I think that was a strength there, where we had once again the autonomy to go try to solve these problems and could get sponsorship to go solve these problems. If you could find your partner on the other side, and shake hands, and go after it we could move ourselves forward. And there wasn\'t resistance to that. There is a push to, however we get to a better place, let\'s get to that better place. Not about who you are, or what team you\'re sitting in, or my priorities versus your priorities, and how our roadmaps, and all that fun stuff. It was hey, we have this problem, and yeah, it\'s going to involve like three or four teams. Let\'s go figure out how to do that, and we\'ll get together, and we\'ll go agree on the problem, and we\'ll go solve the problem. And so we got that was one of the things that helped us build some of this really cool stuff and these experiences. And I\'m really proud of the teams that did that because we thought about not ourselves. We thought about what we wanted to achieve both for our customers, but also our external customer experience, and we were able to drive to that. Even when it wasn\'t easy, even when we weren\'t aligned on exactly how we planned, that was something that we did really well there. And I think the culture of the company of empowering people within the company to go tackle those kinds of problems made that successful. Naber:\xa0 Do you have any idea how they did that within the culture? Maybe it was like one or two things that empowered people to be able to go solve those problems, and have that autonomy? Jennifer Knight: Yeah. And it was that way pretty much from day one. I mean, so there\'s flip side. Anyone can buy anything, right? Which, on on the system side, is its own like special crazy. But there wasn\'t like a specific tenant that we followed. There wasn\'t anything like that. The one thing that, Dropbox also did well, and LinkedIn had this, but they stressed it in a different way, was this concept that we called cupcake there, which is let\'s have fun together in this. And so I think that that empowering you to go out and like build community, build team, and have fun with it, was something that Drew and Arash really instilled. But there\'s not a like phrase or a specific behavior other than encouraging an environment of community, and communication, and through that you could go find your people, and find your path. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Yeah. It makes a lot of sense, and it\'s extremely empowering. I felt that when I was at Dropbox as well. But cupcake, it\'s a really good thing to add. Like having fun while we\'re doing it, and working on cool shit together That\'s pretty cool. And that\'s a good place to start for all the stuff you want to work on versus just what\'s necessary or having a less creative mindset around it or vantage point? Awesome. All right, let\'s move on to Stripe. So yyou\'re leaving Dropbox, you\'re heading to Stripe. Why do you make the jump to Stripe, and what are you up to there right now? Jennifer Knight: So, it\'s been a progression of scope actually. Something that I laugh...I love my job because I get to be incredibly nosy and learn everything about the back end operating of a world. So at LinkedIn I got to learn so much about how Sales and Marketing think, what they prioritize, personalities, what\'s top of mind, what are the pressures, what are the challenges? I mean I knew it because I actually interviewed for some Sales jobs. I will never be a Salesperson. That is a such a hard job. And being on the technical side, I also appreciate the challenges of a technical world. But having the opportunity to be in with Sales teams and Marketing teams, and see how they think was something that I got to do at LinkedIn. I got to Dropbox, it was doing that and then I got the opportunity to learn how accountants think because I took over finance Systems. But it dropped off, and it\'s totally different world. I took an introduction to financial accounting after sitting in our first CFO\'s staff meeting because, I was like, I literally understand none of the terms. And I had an amazing partner in our revenue accountant. She was Sarah, she was patient person. I took over the finance Systems team, and we were working on a project. And she was describing debits and credits, and she\'s walking everything through with me, and she\'s willing to repeat herself as I\'m stumbling through it. And I got to really understand that the pressures in their world are really fundamentally different than the pressures in Sales and Marketing. And they have external pressures with GAAP, and all of these other requirements that they\'re marching to. And so it got to learn about that. At Dropbox though, there was no mandate when I was there for the Business Technology team, we were slowly picking up pieces. And that was a fun way, but it was also hard. Sometimes, I was picking them up and they were healthy, and sometimes I was picking them up, and they were in an interesting place. So I\'m going through that, and we were getting pretty big, pretty stable as a team. And then through a friend, ended up chatting with the CFO at Stripe, and they were looking for someone to lead Internal Systems. And that would be Finance, Sales, Marketing Support, People, the whole set. And that\'s what ultimately pulled me there. Also the fact Stripe earlier reminded me, in tone and approach, to LinkedIn in the early days. There was just something about it that, frankly, just felt familiar. And so that was why I decided to take that opportunity. Naber:\xa0 It\'s amazing how often someone\'s tone and what they say...when you\'ve been at a few different tech businesses, you understand what good culture looks like. And you walk into a place, and you\'re having all these conversations when you\'re going through the recruitment process. It\'s amazing how often it comes up where, some version of, it felt like I was coming home, or it felt like I was going to something that I already knew, and I could see like where the movie was going. I\'ve seen this movie before. I\'ve directed it. I like the culture because it feels like coming home. A few of those different things happen a lot when you\'re making your third, fourth, fifth jump into a lot of these businesses, you start to get a really good sense of the bullseye for what you want as well. Maybe I\'m just ahead of my skis on that, but it sounds like that\'s you felt as well. Jennifer Knight: Yeah, I think it\'s very true. At some point...So, I think everywhere you go, you learn, right? Every situation you\'re in, you learn. And you learn what works for you, and what doesn\'t work for you. And it\'s not even a judgment call. It\'s just part of who we all are, and what makes us happy. We find our people, and we\'re successful with our people, and hopefully we get an opportunity to meet many, many people of many different approaches. But I think at the point that you\'re talking about, for me, I think about the fact that...Of all the three places that I\'ve been, that are roughly similar shape, they all have the same problems. So you\'re actually solving the same base problems very frequently. Naber:\xa0 Can you run through some of these as you\'re thinking about them? Jennifer Knight: Yeah, so, actually the reason I talk about order to cash is that\'s a problem for everyone, everywhere. It\'s a really complicated, really tough flow. It\'s hard to get right. It\'s really frustrating when it\'s not supported. And that\'s one that I\'ve seen everywhere as a challenge. Data models, everyone gets their Salesforce data model wrong, everyone - like, it just, it happens. One of my first projects at LinkedIn was fixing the data model. One of my first projects at Dropbox was fixing data model. That can be really hard to fix. You can be like, oh, like that sounds simple. But you put the wrong data model in place, and then you lock it in place with a bunch of integration, and a bunch of automation, and a bunch of tooling. So by the time you get to the point where you need to roll it back, you have to roll back a lot to get back to that place. Naber:\xa0 You\'re duct taped, and scotch taped, and glued everything together. Jennifer Knight: Yep. So in order to do some data model work at Dropbox, it took me 12 months to rewrite a piece of code that was running on a python script under someone\'s desk, so that we could unlock it. There\'s that kind of work. The exercising the capability and the muscle around planning, planning your Systems change. You\'re often in an environment where everything is moving extremely rapidly, and on the process side you\'re iterating, and you\'re iterating and iterating. And then Systems don\'t always benefit from that rapid of iteration. There\'s a point where you have to be able to experiment outside the system. And when you get closer, you don\'t have to be perfect, but when you get closer to your ideal process, then you want to systematize it. So when a team like mine comes in, one of the big challenges we face is not actually a technical challenge. It\'s working with our partners to say, I know this feels like we\'re slowing down. We\'re not saying no, we\'re not saying stop, but we have to take a step back, and we have to once again put this in context, and figure out how we rationalize this within the system. And so that muscle, it\'s a challenge for everyone. It\'s a challenge everywhere. So that\'s one we face. These problems are very similar. And to your point when I\'m making a decision now about where I want to go, you\'re living with this community and in this environment for a pretty significant portion of your day or your life, over the course of time that you\'re at that company. And everyone that has worked in tech knows it\'s not nine to five. If you\'ve managed to pull 9-5, you\'re lucky. So you\'re probably spending most of your waking hours for several years, in that environment, and that being one that you feel supported in, feel excited to go to, that resonates with who you are. And where you are in that moment in your career and your life, I think is incredibly important. You can\'t always get it right, and you\'re going to find an environment that isn\'t the perfectly resonant one, but that\'s okay because then you learn aspects of that. And I think even there, you can take aspects of those environments, and take them with you going forward. But I agree. Especially the third or fourth time around. I think it\'s true. We always try to find a place where we feel might be a bit more like home. Naber:\xa0 Cool. Good one. All right, Stripe. Two things - why don\'t we start first with an example of a major project you\'re working on, and maybe you could talk through as much as you can give us without giving confidential information obviously, but what are some of the really cool major projects or one major project even to give us an idea of the type of stuff you\'re doing at these different companies. So you\'ve given really good examples so far. Give us a profile of Stripe and some of the things you\'re working on. Jennifer Knight: Yeah, I\'d say actually I\'ll do a little bit of a different answer than a systems answer because I always loved the technical stuff. The project that I\'m working on at Stripe, and that\'s been the thing that\'s so top of mind for me over the last two years, is actually establishing the team. And establishing a team that is proactive and not reactive. Understanding what our actual needs are. So to give you a sense, my team when I joined, there were a few people in the organization who were part time working on Systems. And so the Systems were pretty underfunded, and that was one of the reasons they asked me to join. But putting language around what it actually looks like to manage these Systems well, putting language around the fact that we have huge gaps right now, and with that language also still keeping my team motivated, is that dance of being able to say we\'re here, we\'re growing, we\'re here to support you, and in the same breadth, I appreciate and understand that there is a laundry list of things that we were not able to do. And keeping that dialogue going, and figuring out how we grow up into Stripe as an organization, and how we try to close that, as rapidly as possible, close that gap. Which on the surface frequently looks like we aren\'t moving fast enough because some of these things, I mean they\'re around hiring, they\'re around team structures, they\'re around normalizing as a team. They\'re around that the thing that I just mentioned about learning how to partner with our partners, helping our partners understand planning processes. The big project that I\'ve, there\'s a bunch of technical projects, there\'s a bunch of these kinds of negotiations, but actually the big project that I\'ve been working on at Stripe is around that area. How do we understand how to best serve the organization? How are we getting out of this proactive mode? How do we become, I think we always are a value add, but how do we really drive that value forward? And how do we become a team that is not a handful of people who are just heads down executing, and trying to like scramble to the next thing, and are more laying the foundations and partnering to lay the foundations with our business partners? Knowing that we\'re a couple of, frankly, we\'re a couple of years behind, so we have a lot to lot to catch up on. That\'s really been, if I look at it across all of my teams, and what my function is doing right now. We are working on technical projects, we\'re delivering things every day, we\'re trying to move those forward. Kind of core things, core capabilities that I\'ve discussed before are projects that we\'re working on. But really more than anything right now, we\'re focused on - how do we partner? How do we partner for success? How do we understand what we should be investing in with our partners? And how do we really surface their underlying needs versus the rapid fire day to day? Naber:\xa0 So that is really interesting. I\'ve got a question for that. So can you explain what the end result looks like? What does euphoria look like when you get to this place where...maybe not euphoria, you get what I\'m saying though... you get to this place where you\'re being proactive, you\'re working with the business on the things you should be working on, and it is working like a smooth machine that is operating on all cylinders. What does that look like, and what do you guys accomplishing when that happens? Jennifer Knight: Yeah. So maybe I\'ll start with what it doesn\'t look like. There\'s no world in which we\'re done, and there\'s no world in which there\'s no backlog, and there\'s actually no world in which we are doing everything the business wants you...all 10 items, every sprint. That just, that has never happened in the course of my career, regardless of the team size or anything like that. There will always be needs. There will always be needs that we can\'t serve immediately today. And part of that is actually the right investment model for the business overall. So we\'re always looking at prioritization. I think when it\'s smoothly, the factors that I look at are..We have transparent and clear communication with our partners. They know what they\'re getting, and we\'re delivering that in the way that we\'ve committed to delivery. They are actively engaged and partnering, and feel good about the prioritization. They know why. They know the business impact, because they\'re defining it. But there\'s a lot of really clear communications there. And then on our side, like I said, we\'re delivering on time or delivering in a way that is thoughtful and accountable to the rest of the ecosystem. So we\'re not breaking each other, and we\'re not breaking the system. That actually gets quite difficult at scale. If you have five developers on a platform, and sometimes they have overlap, you have to make sure that they\'re all developing the Product that is your CRM or the Product that is your Marketing automation platform in a way that is conscientious. So, we are, when we\'re operating smoothly, we are not blowing up each other\'s work. That\'s a pretty obvious one in my mind. I think when we\'re operating smoothly, we are responding to the right things, with the right urgency, in the right SLA\'s. So this is one of the reasons we end up with a Run function. Not every ask has to be treated like a project, but not every ask can be treated like a quick win. So you want to have varying SLA\'s and varying approaches, and when we\'re running smoothly we have an intake process that allows us to triage those, and be very quickly responsive where it\'s appropriate, and be thoughtful and measured in our approach, where that\'s appropriate. But not trying to do a one size fits all. Those are the core tenants that I look to when I think about how my team is running smoothly. I think that maybe one that we don\'t talk about with the business as much, is we also spend some time thinking about the technical foundations, and how those potentially need to evolve because our SaaS partners are evolving different features, and giving us different capabilities. So maybe we set up an integration one way four years ago because that was what Zendesk allowed us to do. And that might be really difficult for us to maintain and manage. And on the business side, it may look like it just works. And on our side, it may be a ton of toil and work to keep it alive. And Zendesk releases a new feature that simplifies that. How do we also continuously bring technical, underlying improvements, infrastructure improvements, into our roadmap. And then when we\'re working really well, socializing those up with our partners so they really appreciate why us doing that work actually improves their world and makes us more efficient together. Those are the high level things that I look for when I think about my team operating well. And like I said though, the work will never stop. It will always be there. Which is the exciting and fun part. So really it\'s about transparency, and process, and prioritization. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Awesome answer. Thanks so much, Jenn. So last question, and then we\'ll wrap. Okay. I\'ve got one rapid fire question for you as well. So, one of your many superpowers, that you\'ve alluded to a little bit, throughout your answers, but is...As you\'re going through every single one of these projects and all of your decisions, thinking as an end to end process thinker, where you\'re keeping the big picture in mind while you\'re able to zoom in and out of the details and the different requirements, and how do all these things stick together over an entire project over a sustained period of time. How do you bring stakeholders along with you in that journey? Because you\'re saying no a lot, you\'re saying yes a lot, you\'re saying no a lot more than you\'re saying yes. And you\'re also telling them, hey, please wait. Being a Sales and Marketing operator myself, I know that we could be inpatient every once in a while. So how do you bring stakeholders along in those conversations, and what are some of the best practices that you use for communicating with stakeholders? Because you\'re so good at that naturally, but that is not necessarily a Sales of Marketing operators forte as they\'re thinking about, just what they want to do for that quarter or that half of that year. Jennifer Knight: Yeah. Yeah. So I\'ve had a couple of different approaches. I think once again, this is an interesting one...That you say it\'s a strength that I can think that way. And sometimes one of my weaknesses of getting it out of my mind, and onto a piece of paper. And so what I\'ve gotten better at over time is making sure...everyone who knows me knows I love a whiteboard. I actually don\'t think that most people in these complex scenarios, there\'s a few of them that can, if you describe it with words, actually can follow along. I\'m someone that, if someone starts, if I focus extremely hard and someone is describing something, I can usually think that I\'ve understood. But sometimes when they put it on the board, I realized actually I didn\'t. So one of the techniques that I use, and I actually encourage everyone on my team to do, and I encourage our partners to do, is write on the board. Write your process on the board. On our side we will write then the system on the board. And let\'s all look at it, and then talk about the areas that we don\'t understand, or talk about the areas where we want clarification. In our side, when I start to think, okay, here\'s our end to end process, now you have all these Systems. Helping people come along, part of it is by laying out, here\'s the areas that maybe we\'re gonna be able to accelerate quickly, and here\'s the areas where I either don\'t have complete control - I\'m going to have to negotiate with a partner, or is technically complex. So let\'s look at the whole thing end to end. But starting that visual from the process. And it doesn\'t have to be elegant. It doesn\'t have to follow all the fancy flowchart, actual diagrams. I do love that stuff sometimes, but get a pen out, sit down together, and make sure that you both are actually speaking the same language. And then that your priorities align. So I might get really passionate about some part of the process that somewhere else I\'ve seen be really interesting, and that might not really be what you\'re passionate about. Or I might be able to bring some insight because I\'ve seen this at a larger company. I can say, hey, two years, we don\'t have to face it today, but two years from now we\'re gonna need these kinds of controls. I\'m telling you that I want to build this foundation in today because I\'m looking forward. Do we agree that that\'s an okay thing to do? But even to get it out of your mind, get it onto a board. That\'s a huge one. Then, like I said, on the transparency side for our team, we have milestones. We are sending out sometimes weekly or biweekly updates on how we\'re progressing against those phases of the project. We\'re checking back in what has changed. Have our priorities changed? Have some more micro points within the plan, do we need to adjust? Have we learned something new that\'s going to shift something out? Those are the muscles that we exercise. But I think the first and most important thing is - can we all get in a room, and can we look at this thing end to end, and do we actually, are we speaking the same language? And I\'m not going to say it verbally to you. I\'m going to show you. And then pull out a pen, and mark it up, and tell me where it\'s crazy, or tell me where it doesn\'t work, or tell me where your world is different. And that way we on my side of the house, have the context of where you\'re coming from. And you on the business side, can understand how we\'re thinking about the approach. And no one is surprised. That would be the tactic that I think about a lot. Naber:\xa0 Man...I wish I could wrap that thought up and hug it because I loved it so much. You and I have a similar brain in some respects, and I\'m loving that answer. Okay, last question. We\'re done with going through all these different examples, all this information. As you wearing like a tweed jacket and a hat right now, because you just professored everyone with all of your knowledge. So, one rapid fire question. So, I ask this to people on their birthdays every single year. It\'s not your birthday, but I\'m asking anyways. Our audience has heard me say that a hundred times, apologies, but I\'m explaining for the guests because they don\'t know. Maybe they\'ve listened to all of them, nope they haven\'t. Most important learning or lesson you\'ve acquired professionally in the last 12 months? Jennifer Knight: I would say, I\'ve always been a patient person. But in the last 12 months, I\'ve actually gotten much better at learning how to be both patient and persistent. Which is kind of a weird abstract learning, I\'ll give it that. But in environments where a lot of changes driven by influence or cross team collaboration, and everybody is under a lot of strainm under resourced in their own way...Figuring out how to navigate that in a way that continuously feels constructive, is not something that I would say was my strength in the past. I am definitely someone who likes to get things done, and I\'m a bit principled in my approach. But same thing happens to my team. People are coming to me and saying, Jenn, can you do this thing? Can you do this thing? And I\'m saying, no, we have to put it in this roadmap. Learning how to be the customer on that side. And how do I navigate that? And how do I continue to emphasize the importance of something or being respectful and patient of the process that I\'m in? And being okay with that patient. Part of it is with my partners, and part of it for me is actually with myself. It\'s knowing that when you\'re turning a really big ship, it\'s slow. And some months and quarters you have this moment where you\'re like, what did what have I accomplished? And those accomplishments are a bit abstract. They\'re maybe not, I delivered this project or made this great presentation. They\'re like I hired these people, and these people are ramping. That means in two quarters it\'s going to be awesome. Or I changed part of a culture around an approach. Or I encouraged another team and my team to participate together in a project. And yes, that project hasn\'t started, but the train is slowly leaving the station. That patience with myself, with my team, and with others, and really thinking about how to be persistent, but patient with the process, is something that I would say I\'ve learned quite a bit about in the last 12 months...

Good to have you on the show, man. Thanks so much for coming. Naber:\xa0 Naber, anything for you my man. Wow, anything, I like that. Don\'t. Tempt. Me. So, I am so excited to have you on. You\'re a world-class dude. So many people in my inter and outer circle know who you are, have crossed paths with you, have worked with you, have worked for you, you\'ve worked for, or just some sort of combination thereof, and there\'s just not enough nice things to say about you as a dude, let alone, as a professional. So, I\'m excited to have you on. So one of the things I want to do is, we\'re going to jump through some of your personal life, a little bit about where you grew up, how you grew up, what you were like, all the way through school. And then what we\'ll hop into is, the bulk of what we\'ll talk about today, which is your professional experience. And both the strengths and learnings you\'ve gained along the way, but some of your superpowers that you are just top 1% in the world at, and talk about some of the frameworks and principles that you think about. And then we\'llget into some of the methods as well, and some of the process and examples. Sound okay? Nick DeMarinis: That sounds great. Excited to be here. Naber:\xa0 Awesome man. So basketball player, ice hockey, soccer, Jesuit high school, Tampa, Saint Leo, St John\'s in Rome. Hong Kong, New York, identical twin boys. We\'ll talk about all of it. What I want to hear as we go through that is, let\'s first talk about maybe four or five minutes on how you grew up. What was the life of Nick D as a kid? What were you like? Tell me about some of your interests, go through school a little bit, and tell me about some of your hobbies. And I\'ll interrupt you, hopefully not too rudely, to ask you maybe a little bit more detail. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, totally. Well, before we kick off, thanks again for inviting me. The minute I got your email, I was excited to see what was in there and to reconnect. I know we\'ve always stayed in touch, but it\'s been awhile since we able to connect, and really talk through what\'s been going on in life. And as you mentioned, you\'re putting this together to pay forward all of the learnings, and the coaching you\'ve had, and I\'m excited to do that as well. And every day I learn more and more, and it\'s just exciting to share all of my experiences and people that helped me along the way. And as you said, it starts for me at a very young age, right? Where and how I grew up. My parents grew up in New York. They met when they were 15, got married and they were 19, had their first kid at 20, and then had six children. Fast track six children. Irish, Italian family. We drink with one hand, we talk with the other. And you know, my dad was in Sales his whole career, right? My Dad was Sales his whole career. And he always valued relationships, and he was very successful, end to end and his career on the basis of relationships. Me being one of six kids, growing up, we\'re always very competitive. Who\'s the first one to get to the bathroom in the morning, take a shower? I was also a middle child, so I had to be pretty diplomatic in my approach, right? I couldn\'t be this authority as the oldest, and I couldn\'t be like, Hey, I can get away with anything. I was a baby. I kind of had to play both ends of the spectrum. So I learned that early on of how to manage relationships up, and down, and sideways. We just love sports. We love being competitive, all of us. And I never really got too deep in a single sport because I just loved the ideas of other sports, and trying those out, and getting good at those. And in particular I just love team sports, right? I think individual sports were fun, but I loved the idea of going into battle with others, with the team behind you. And you know, although I grew up in Florida, unfortunately my father raised me a New York sports fan. So I had to adopt the New York Knicks and the New York jets, which are horrible sports teams. Naber:\xa0 I saw Stephen A. Smith\'s video of his, basically a nervous breakdown, or his breakdown he had on TV. And I thought of you immediately. I felt miserable for you in that moment. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah. Yeah, it\'s been bad. But you know what it\'s taught me...and through my dad\'s professional career, through their marriage of over 50 years, through being in New York Knicks fan, as hilarious as it is this idea of loyalty. There\'s been a lot of lessons around loyalty through...and it might be tough times for a very long time, and there\'s gonna be ups and downs. But, that\'s what I learned a lot about growing up. It\'s just the value of family relationships, and loyalty, as much as it can hurt some times. Naber:\xa0 That\'s an amazing lesson to learn. I mean, it give back to you so much over time as well, loyalty over time. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Naber:\xa0 Cool. So, what was the first thing you did to make money? Nick DeMarinis: First thing I did to make money. I sorted through a bunch of baseball cards that I inherited from my older brothers, and I went through the Beckett magazines that showed how much these cards were worth. And I tallied all that up, and I thought I was going to make thousands of dollars off these cards. But I was kind of talked out of it to hold onto those as an investment for later in life. So that\'s not how I made money. I thought that that\'s how I was going to become rich. First way I made money, it was really concession stand at at the little league field. Spent a lot of time as a young kid playing baseball, and then once it got to that certain age, I think it was 13, which is when they allowed you to actually work the concession stand, and sell M&M\'s, making whatever the minimum wage was, that was it. So yeah, it was a very efficient way to make money because as soon as my shift was over, it\'s back to the field, back to playing ball. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Love it. Love it. So your middle child, you\'re going through school, you\'re selling M&Ms, and you\'re playing a ton of sports, competing on first to the shower, first to the bathroom, first to the dinner table, first inside if everyone\'s outside playing, totally get it. One of five kids myself, so that rings a bell for me. So when you were in high school, tell me a little bit about some of the things you\'re interested in outside of sports, and then we can get into why you went to Saint Leo, and what that transition was like. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, I mean, it\'s funny, it was really all about sports in high school for me. A funny enough, it\'s funny to say, but I went to an all boys, Jesuit high school, right? So I was also really interested in girls. There was a sister school nearby, but we just didn\'t have a lot of interaction. So it was like, you\'re at that age of adolescence throughout your teenager years, and it\'s this fascination around your first date, and what does prom look, and all that fun stuff. But outside of that, what I was really interested in is the world outside of where I grew up. And I was really fascinated about New York, about where my parents grew up and I didn\'t, I grew up in Florida and I visited. I was really fascinated about where my grandparents came from in Italy. I was really fascinated about like, what\'s outside this world of Florida, of Tampa where I grew up. And I know that\'s kind of the case for a lot of people. So, throughout high school I really started to think about that, using sports as a way to be able to maybe travel, or get to another state, another country, and then think about that as I get into college. I made the decision to stay in school in Florida, nearby for a variety of personal and professional reasons. But then, as I\'ve gone through University, that\'s where I decided to make the leap to study abroad in Italy, which really eye opening for me see the rest of the world outside of where I grew up. Naber:\xa0 Cool. Love it. That\'s a great transition. You make the jump to St Leo. Why Saint Leo? Tell us what it was like, maybe a couple of minutes about what life was for you in school in Uni. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, totally. I don\'t have the greatest story actually about Saint Leo. I was a hockey player in Florida, and I was pretty good, in the state of Florida. You compare me against kids that grew up in Michigan, and I was definitely below average. But I wanted to play college hockey, and we we\'re on a few recruiting trips, and we decided that really the cost of schooling at some of these Northeastern schools versus the in-state tuition in Florida...I had to make a call whether I want to enjoy university and the life that comes with being a student versus playing a college sport, and struggling with tuition costs, and being at the mercy of 5AM practices. And I made a call there. And Saint Leo was a nice balance. Had smaller classroom sizes, it wasn\'t University of Florida or FSU, which you\'re in an auditorium. I wanted a smaller, more intimate environment where I could just get to know my professors, get pretty hands on with the curriculum, and that\'s how I went to Saint Leo, and enjoyed every minute of it. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Awesome. So, you had a life changing experience when you studied over in Rome. It\'s obviously kicked off your, not just to quench your appetite, but really over time when you live enough places you turn adventure into lifestyle, and then you just kinda never go back. But I\'m guessing that was the start and the first step of that for you. So tell us about heading over to Rome to study there, and then we\'ll hop into your first role after school. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, I mean, I couldn\'t have said it any better. That absolutely was a turning point in my life where I turned adventure into a lifestyle. And that adventure and overcoming it, as tough as it felt in the moment, has been the foundation of how I think about all future challenges and future adventures, as small and big as they are. Because for a lot of us growing up in the US, or anywhere in the world, for you to branch outside of your comfort zone, into a new world, with this new language, it can be really scary in the moment. But I decided, it was my senior year of college, and there was no time better than to make that leap. And I had roots in Italy, right? It\'s where family came from. So, there was a lot of self interest, and what I wanted to accomplish and get out of that experience, so that\'s what I did. So I made the move there. Funny enough, on day one, I met a girl there who was all studying in the same program, who\'s now my wife. Naber:\xa0 Whoa. That\'s how you guys met? Awesome. Nick DeMarinis: That\'s how we met. There was another girl that went to the same school and I asked her how\'s your living situation? I\'m living with five girls. She said, I\'ll be there in two minutes. And when I got there I was introduced to Diana, and that was my future wife. So that was the best part of that experience. But I think outside of that as well, it was just, just opened up my eyes to, there\'s another world out, there\'s other cultures, there\'s another way of living life and doing business. And I enjoyed it so much in that study abroad program, which was one semester, I basically stayed there, and then applied to graduate school. Saint John\'s had a program there. Ended up staying in Italy for almost two years. I really just wanted to learn more business. I wanted to learn a language. I wanted to not just have this four month point in life. I wanted to embed myself. So it it was a great journey, expensive journey, but a great one. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. I mean, the Euro\'s not friendly to the USD at that point either. Great story about how you got how you and Diana met, and obviously now you have two beautiful identical twin boys, Luca and Max - is that right? We\'ll get into that a little bit later. I don\'t want to get you on a tangent here because you\'re going to turn into #prouddad. So you come back from Rome, walk us through your first couple of roles up through the point where you\'re going to make a jump to LinkedIn, and we\'ll pause there and ask you a couple of questions. But you had some really interesting, good, significant learning experiences before you got to LinkedIn. Let\'s walk through those. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, what\'s not on my profile is I did work on Wall Street for two days. Actually it was a day and a half I think. When I was going through college, a little bit of a direction from my father was get into finance. You\'re going to make a good living, it\'s going to be stable. That should be your path, and you\'re pretty good at it. And that\'s what I studied, and I wasn\'t really sure if that was my path, it\'s hard to really understand until you get into the professional workforce. So I moved to New York, I worked on Wall Street. It was a small commodities broker. And I don\'t know how I realized this, but I realized pretty quickly it was not for me. Maybe it was this specific company, maybe it was the environment, it. I just got an idea that I don\'t think this is right, and my gut tells me that. I remember quitting. I called my father and I said, you\'re going to be really disappointed with me, but I just don\'t think this is the industry for me, I don\'t think this is the path, I need to do some searching here. And he was so supportive. He was like, I\'m so proud that you\'ve figured this out so quickly - to fail quickly is this thing that is really hard to do. So I did that, and went back to the drawing board. This is the first idea that I had around really building this personal Board of Directors. I started to think through, okay, who can help me figure out what is the industry I should be in? What is the job? What function should I be looking for? And I got some really good advice from some people in my corner. And I landed a job at a place called University Sports Publications. It married two things that I thought I\'d be really passionate about, which is Sales and speaking to people, and sports, right? So, that was a good experience. It was kind of a boiler room setting. It was a lot of phone calls. It was a lot of rejection, you\'re selling advertising and it was Game Day sports programs to contractors and subcontractors. So it wasn\'t as glorious as the job description sounded, but what it taught me was resilience, right? This idea of following the Sales structure, of overcoming objectives, of the value of sharing peers and name dropping others in the industry that are using that. So it taught me a lot about the frameworks of a Sales process, and how to be resilient in that, if you have the right solution. So kind of sucked in the moment, but it taught me, taught me a lot there. Again, the culture wasn\'t something I was really looking for. It was very, very results driven, very cut throat. And I got a referral to get an interview at Yahoo!. And had a few interviews there, and really felt that was a company that more aligned what I was looking for in the technology space. And Yahoo!, the culture at the time, was way more accommodating to my type of personality. And yeah, joined Yahoo! in 2007. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Walk us through the roles you had at Yahoo!. You were there for about four years. So walk us through a couple of those roles, and then I\'ve got a few questions on some of the things that you learned while you were there. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, so the roles at Yahoo!, it was primarily different Sales roles. So I was either selling recruitment advertising to recruitment agencies or to corporates. There was a little bit of an Account Executive, so selling to first time customers, bringing them on board, a lot of prospecting, a lot of Sales Development, a lot of cold outreach. And then later on in my career, Yahoo! was more around relationship management, and how do we help them, and make sure they\'re having success using our solutions, and make sure they\'re happy customers, and we\'re leveraging that to the best of it\'s ability. So that that was mostly the crux of my time in the four years at Yahoo!. Naber:\xa0 Nice. And what do you think was the number one thing that you think you\'ve learned at Yahoo!? Nick DeMarinis: The number one thing I learned at Yahoo! would probably be, it\'s the value of your boss. I had some really great bosses at Yahoo!. I think, before that, my bosses were this dictator type figures. and the bosses I had at Yahoo! were very much more around my leadership philosophy, which is way more democratic, right? Anytime we were making decisions, we\'re thinking about a way to approach the business, or approach our customers, it was very much involving everybody. And there was always a sense of authority when they needed to have it, right? If we had a healthy the debate around something, that person also also knew when to come in and say, great, I value all the feedback, and this is where this is how we\'re going to move forward. But, really took the time to value everyone\'s opinion, and have it a team approach in terms of how we solve any types of questions, any types of problems. Naber:\xa0 Nice one. Good. Okay, let\'s hop into LinkedIn. I think actually, I\'m going to save my other question for after you get through this. So walk us through the journey you had at LinkedIn over the next few minutes on, the roles that you had, the jumps that you made, and what you were responsible for in each one. Maybe three or four minutes. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, absolutely. So jump to LinkedIn, right place, right time. Yahoo! HotJobs, which is the property I was working for, was bought by Monster that was going through a transition I wasn\'t incredibly happy about, and LinkedIn was opening up a new office on the east coast. I got introduced to James Volpentest and Scott Nelson. And we had dinner, and they were looking to build, a Sales team in New York. So I was part of the first Sales team in New York. There was about 12 or 15 of us in a serviced office. And and that was an incredible journey. At a tim, LinkedIn had about 80 million members. And we were really bringing on our earliest customers in terms of using this professional network as a platform to find passive talent. So that was a Sales role, pure hunter, selling the dream about what this professional platform was going to become, and how it can help companies solve a lot of their hiring needs. So the biggest jump from there moving to Hong Kong. So, you want me to go ahead and take you into that decision as well? Yeah, totally. So, I realized pretty quickly on at LinkedIn, this is going to be a global platform, no doubt about it. It\'s going to global network that a lot of people in professionals would really benefit from around creating economic opportunity. And we started to think about opening offices, and as you know as well, opening offices all around the world, in Asia, and Europe and going back to that adventure of living in Italy, I thought, how can I parlay that into an adventure somewhere else? Maybe a bit more of an intelligent risk for me. And I was thinking about different offices. There\'s Dublin, there\'s Sydney, and I wanted something a little bit more of a challenge. So we started talking internally about Hong Kong. And it was a very strategic market for us, as a gateway into China. And we wanted to be that first professional network into China. So, I spoke to my Manager time, I said, what does it take? We need people there. And this is about a year before that. And his advice was, just be great at your job right now, and then when the time is right, we can discuss that opportunity. So, that\'s what I did. I just put my head down. I tried to master the role I was currently in. I wanted to be very, very clear about, what value am I going to bring to a new market in terms of bringing that LinkedIn headquarters culture and DNA, and making sure that that\'s being spread through new markets and new cultures. And made the jump to Hong Kong in 2013. Naber:\xa0 Awesome, man. That\'s great. And tell us what you\'re responsible for in Hong Kong, and and how your role grew a little bit. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah. So initially a little bit of everything. I think of the role as, you\'re helping hire for the team, you\'re helping bring on your early customers, you\'re helping define your early culture. You\'re doing a little bit everything. And we were all doing it together. It wasn\'t a figurehead of the office, it a few of us that come together to drive that. So, I help bring on some of our earlier customers, help make a lot of decisions around our hiring and building out the team, setting some of the traditions around our office such as new hire introductions, and special talents, and costumes. Just things that lightened the mood that are consistent with the way LinkedIn does things. And of course as the business grew and the team grew, that evolved into a leadership position. And I was raised my hand of, hey, I\'m ready to be a utility player in leadership of where you need help. So, at that time we were thinking about growing our teams in Southeast Asia. So I started to manage Account Executives in Singapore, and Japan, and start to build our business and build our customer base in those markets. Which was a great experience for me. Just being able to manage the remote teams, and all the challenges that comes with that, as well as managing multiple cultures. In Japan specifically, managing teams that hardly speak the same language, right? And it\'s really hard to be able to add a lot of value, even when I go on customer engagements, when it\'s speaking a different language as well. So I had to really think about where\'s the areas I\'m going to be able to add value? A lot of that for me was like, removing a lot of internal barriers for them. I can\'t help them in how they\'re speaking to their customer, but I can help remove the process, and remove some of the friction that\'s helping them get their job done. So that was a lot of my learnings in terms of like, I gotta be really clear about where I\'m going to be able to add value, and where I\'m not right, when you\'re managing different teams and different cultures. And then, towards the end of my time there, it was managing more of a holistic team across the Hong Kong office. So, end to end from Sales Development, to Global Accounts, and how I brought those teams together, and I just went really deep within the Hong Kong market specifically, across different teams in different segments. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. It\'s it is an amazing journey, and you were doing it so early in the life cycle of people moving to international offices from one or another us hub. So from San Francisco, from Chicago, from New York, and you did early in that time, where you didn\'t necessarily see or have a playbook in order to be able to do that. It\'s kind of like, figure it out as you go and learn with other people as they go around setting up some of these offices, especially, in Asia. You\'ve sold for a long time, and helped sell for a long time. I know from hearing from other people how hands on and close to the frontline you are with being able to help out with your Sales reps, and teaching and coaching them on how to sell, best practices, etc. And one of the things that I\'ve heard both from you, and from other people, is this concept of becoming a trusted advisor. So when you\'re talking to your sales team, both at WeWork and LinkedIn, and you\'re giving advice, tell us a little bit about the concept of being a trusted advisor, and how you explain that to people. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, absolutely. I couldn\'t be more passionate about the equation that comes with being a trusted advisor. And I think some people snooze off as soon as I start to give them an equation. But hear me out, hear me out. This idea of trusted advisor, it gets thrown around quite a bit, right? And there\'s different definitions, but I think this one I really subscribed to, and I really hammer it home as I think about our relationships, our Sales process, qualifying deals, qualifying our Accounts. And I think it\'s really telling as we break down the different parts. So, if you think about a trusted advisor, there\'s a numerator, and there\'s a denominator. Now in the numerator, there\'s really three parts to how you become a trusted advisor to your client. And that can be a client that you\'ve worked with forever, or a client that you just met yesterday, right? And the first is credibility. Are you credible in what you\'re speaking about? The industry, your product, how it\'s going to perform, right? Like, you need to be able to get to be a subject matter expert on what you\'re sharing to your client. And this goes with sharing to candidates as well, and hiring, there\'s a lot of ways to apply this. So credibility is one. I think, on reflection for me and we work, I\'ve been here four and a half months, that\'s an area of development for me. I\'m in a new industry in real estate. There\'s a lot going on. We\'re transforming the industry. I\'m not as credible as I want to be yet, and I\'m taking a lot of steps to be able to build that. The second part of the equation is around reliability. So you know that\'s as simple as, are you following through with what you say you\'re going to do? Are you delivering on your solutions? Are you saying, Hey, I can get you that proposal by Friday at 5:00 PM - are you doing that? For me personally as well, if people do what they say they\'re going to do, then, you know that shows reliability, right? And the minute people start saying, we\'re going to do this, we\'re gonna do that, and they don\'t follow through with that, you start to lose not only your credibility, you lose your trust and becoming a reliable individual. Lastly...so we have credibility and knowing your subject, we have reliability, which is you\'re going to do what you say you\'re going to do. And last is around intimacy. I think this is the most important. I couldn\'t be more passionate about the idea that people buy from people, right? I do it all the time, and there\'s a lot of value and things that I buy, but I really like to know who I\'m buying from, and why I\'m buying from an individual, and getting to know that side of things. So I think a lot about intimacy, and how we approach our customers, right? How well do we know them? How well do we know how this is going to impact their personal lives. Do we know their dog\'s name? The more we can get to know, and get to intimate with our customers, and whether that\'s someone that\'s buying from us, or we\'re going to be hiring them, there\'s just that much stronger of a bond, that much stronger of a relationship there. And you can even ask for favors sometimes, right, as you get stuck in certain areas based upon that relationship. Naber:\xa0 Nick , let me ask as a question. Do you have go to categories that are attached to people\'s hearts, so that you can get closer to them, or more intimate with them more quickly? Do you have certain categories that you go after where you\'re like, ask questions about this, this, this, this, and this? Nick DeMarinis: A lot of it comes down a lot of it comes to research, right? Looking at whether it\'s there LinkedIn profiles, or checking them in the news, just finding out what they care about, right? And making sure that I can align that with the intimacy factor, right? If someone cares about wolf conservation, I\'ve adopted rescue dogs from Hong Kong. There\'s maybe some parallels there. And just trying to get to know why they care about that. Family is an easy one, right? Me having twin boys. We did an Executive event last week in Chicago at the Rolling Stones Concert, and a lot of them had families, right? And I just wanted to really get to know about their families, their kids, the schools that they\'re looking to attend, and just really got to know them on an intimate level around their families. And I was able to share my own experience right now as my kids are very young and growing up. So there\'s not really specific categories. I just try to do a lot of research and understand their personal lives, what\'s going on, what do they care about? Naber:\xa0 No, that\'s good. That\'s good. All right. Sorry. Keep going. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah. So on top of all of that, in terms of trusted advisor, there\'s the denominator which is self orientation. So I think people can be very credible, they can be super reliable, and you can be very intimate, and really getting to know your customers. But the minute that self orientation is showing really high, that there\'s a lot more in it for me that I\'m trying to gain out of it. That starts to ruin a bit of the trusted advisor type of relationship that you have with the customer. So, I think a lot of people try to focus too much on on the top, and then they don\'t think enough about self orientation and what\'s in it for them. And that\'s sometimes starts to shine at certain moments, which can really ruin the equation there. So I think that that\'s really important - taking self orientation out of the equation. If you\'re solving the right thing for your client, if you\'re incredibly reliable and intimate, they should be able to want to move forward regardless of what you\'re wanting to gain out of that. Naber:\xa0 I love the equation. Anytime someone breaks down something into an equation, or a framework, or a data driven approach, or something along those lines, I think people\'s ears perk up because it\'s repeatable, and you can also pass it on a more easily as well. So you\'ve managed a lot of Sales teams. You\'ve hired a lot of people. One of the things that I\'ve heard about you from a lot of other people as well, is the power of coaching. And I know that you\'ve gone through certification with Marshall Goldsmith, and I\'d love to learn a little bit about, and have the audience to learn a little bit about some of the top learnings and the top takeaways you had from that Marshall Goldsmith training and learning process. And also how you apply those, maybe with some examples that you use across your teams. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, Marshall Goldsmith was just an incredible investment that I was fortunate to be able to go through, go through that workshop, a world renowned coach. And there\'s a couple things that I\'ve learned from that Executive course. And Marshall Goldsmith, his coaching framework is really centered around stakeholders, right? I think of coaching in two ways...there\'s firsthand observations, objective observations, and being able to coach that way about what\'s observed. Not about how I feel that person did, but I observed this, and I\'ll talk about that a little bit later. Marshall Goldsmith is really around, perception is reality. Let\'s find out what do your your stakeholders think about what you can do to improve, and perception is reality there. And let\'s use feed forward to be able to help an individual improve on that. `So here\'s how he breaks it down. I think, first around coaching is, making sure that that individual picks the one or two growth areas that they want to focus on, put that in their court, right? What do you want to focus on to get better at that is important to both, you, but also aligns with your organization, right? So let\'s say for example, it\'s managing through change, right? That\'s important for me. It\'s also important for our organization. This place is changing every three minutes. The next is, next is to lead the change and the coaching through stakeholders. So really involving your directs, your peers, your bosses. There\'s this idea of Marshall Goldsmith, which is, capturing feed forward rather than feedback. So, if I\'m asking you to give me some feed forward on managing through change, I wouldn\'t say Brandon give me some feedback on how I\'ve managed change in the past. We don\'t care about the past right now. I would say, Brandon, give me some suggestions on how I can get better at managing change moving forward. And it\'s a really cool, powerful tool around feed forward, which is like, you\'re we\'re not reflecting on what\'s happened, you\'re reflecting on what could be beneficial to us moving forward? And that\'s really the crux of it. The individual that\'s being coached then takes that, they\'ve identified they want to get better at, they\'re getting feed forward from the people around them that they care about. And again, it\'s this idea of perception is reality. Whether they\'re right or wrong, these are people that have suggestions for someone to get better. Perception is reality. Let\'s take that. Let\'s put an action plan together. And then part of the Goldsmith plan as well, is to regularly check in to see how that person\'s performing moving forward. Naber: How do you build in the importance of recognition? And how do you think about recognizing others when you know it\'s both one the right thing to do, but two you may not want to do too much. Because a lot of Managers, they put a premium on recognition so they don\'t do it maybe as often as they should, or if they just don\'t do it that often at all. So how do you think about recognition? Because I\'ve heard a lot of people both on your team, as well mentees of yours in the past, say I learned a lot about recognition from Nick. How do you think about it? What\'s your framework? Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, I\'m probably in the camp that there is no such thing as too much recognition. I think that there\'s so much success that individuals and teams have because of the confidence that they\'re getting from other individuals. And whether it\'s a small task or a large task, if they\'re hearing that people are grateful for what they did, or they\'re proud of what they did, I think confidence is really what drives people forward, and creating that type of environment. So I try to build in recognition in so many facets, right? Whether in the way people lead, in the way they deliver results, in the short interactions that they have with individuals... I try to bake it into to my daily life. And whether that\'s a quick email, or over Slack, or whether it\'s a phone call...There\'s something that that I do every Friday, which is a 6:00 PM recurring calendar invite, which is actually more centered around gratitude. So it\'s more around, rather than recognizing an individual for what they\'ve done. I try to do that as I go throughout my day, and it spurs at different moments. I don\'t really have a framework around that. But I do have a framework around making sure that I thank at least one or two people every Friday at the end of the week for what they\'ve done. So whether that\'s an individual that had handled it difficult customer call, and I want to thank them for at least stepping up and showing leadership. Or for example, last Friday, I sent a note to a peer of mine who was really instrumental in helping me ramp here at the company, was really selfless in his time and walking me through the internal relationships, and how to think about now they gave him the company. And without that I probably would continue to be lost here at WeWork. So that\'s a few ways I think about it. I think recognition, it\'s never too much. I think that we should be recognizing small things, little things as much as possible. In my mind, I feel that just continues to build confidence in individuals, for them to continue to push themselves forward. And then I think about, gratitude as really powerful recognition. Not just for those that are making an impact to me and to the team, but also it feels good for my side to really be able to show that the impact that they\'re having on me, it\'s really meaningful. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Love it. And two questions on that one. One, how are you doing this? Is it email? Is it verbally? Is it walking over to their desk? Is it a one on one? Is it closed door conversation? Is it in front of the team? There\'s so many different ways to do this. How do you think about that, and how are you doing this? What\'s your strategy around it? Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, so mostly around a recommendation, right? Naber:\xa0 Yeah, exactly. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah. So I try, I try to 100% of the time to do it in person. I\'m a big believer in, I think this goes with every type of interaction, I try to be very, very conscious and mindful of the setting and the atmosphere, right? So around recognition, I try to make sure, whether it\'s in a walking meeting, or outside, or try to have it over...it\'s gotta be in person, for me. And it could be just hey, let\'s take a walk to the lobby of our office. I try to have it in some type of a warm, casual type type of environment. So mostly the recognition is always in person. I feel like it\'s easy for us to be able to use online platforms, and texts, and whatnot. But be able to look somebody in the eyes, and be able to tell them wholeheartedly...to be able to speak to them and really have that moment where, hey, you, you\'ve made a difference, you made an impact. Whether it\'s small or large, it\'s important that we share this in person, and I thank you for that. That, 100% of the time in my mind, needs to happen in person. It\'s really easy for us to be able to use so many different communication platforms, and ways to connect. Being able to do that in person is for me is really powerful. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Good one. And my follow-up to that is, what have you seen is the pull through of that? What happens when you do that right? What are the next couple of actions, or what have you seen as some of the results from the people that you\'re saying thank you to, and your being grateful towards verbally, out loud? What does that do for both, them, for the team? What\'s the environment that it creates? So that people, that are going to be more conscious in the audience of doing this, like you mentioned it, what can they expect to be the output? Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, absolutely. That\'s a great question. One of my superpowers is positivity, right? So, I\'m always trying to index on bringing in a positive atmosphere, positive feedback, as much as possible. And I\'m also a big believer in focusing on strengths, not weaknesses. There was a Harvard Business Review podcast around constructive feedback is kind of pointless, and that we should be focusing on what people do great, and focused on their strengths. So, when I think about recognition, for example, there was an individual a couple weeks ago that really managed this Sales process in a short time frame really, really well. It was really tight around the beginning of discovery, understanding what the client wants to achieve, to understanding the deal leverage that we had in order to be able to accomplish it in a short period. And I recognized that individual, and what I\'m hoping that the pull through that I\'m hoping to get out of that is, I asked the individual to share that forward. Like, this is a strength of yours. I want to recognize you because you did a great job at that. How do we scale this goodness? How do you take that and share this experience? Share your deal review with other members around you. There\'s so much that people can learn from you. And what I hope to get out of that, which happens a lot of times, is that person is then...there\'s a ripple effect around the benefits of what that person accomplished, and they\'re getting so much confidence from that. They\'re like, wow, I did something really well. I\'m able to share a lot of individuals.; And they\'re going to take that forward into their next actions, their next couple of days of work, with so much confidence around, I did something great, I was able to share that with other individuals, and I know how to bring this forward to the rest of my week. So those are a couple of things that I think about in terms of recognition is like, let\'s focus on the strengths. How do we take whatever you did really good at, how do we share that? How do we scale that across others? And recognition for me, and I think it\'s always to inject this amount of confidence in individuals that they can then just continue to find success in whatever they\'re doing, moving forward. Naber:\xa0 Love it. Love it. Good example too of the pull through. Thank you for that. And you alluded to this already...When you\'re thinking about developing others and also developing yourself in navigating your own professional development, you talk about focusing on strengths. Explain your mindset on that. How do you think about focusing on strengths? And how do you make sure that when you\'re talking to and giving advice to people around their professional development, their career development, how should they think about the strengths?...Sorry, How should they think about focusing on strengths as a strategy for moving forward? Nick DeMarinis: Yeah. So, there\'s a couple parts to that. I think there\'s a lot of different tests out there to figure out what your strengths are, and how does that compare to some of your weaknesses, and how do you think about the two of those? There\'s Clifton Strengths Finder, which I think is a really cool one that I to use with my team sometimes. There\'s also, Travis Carson runs Marketforce, and it really helps you understand your style, your style indicator. So for example, for me and my market force style, I\'m pretty balanced, but I\'m moreso power. And the strengths in that for business for me are sustaining relationships over time, and very focused on tangible results. So, whatever platform someone wants to use to figure out what their strengths are, I think they should harness that and figure out how they bring that to life in their daily environment. When it comes to weaknesses, I think that\'s just how you compliment each other, right? If I\'m strong in certain ares, but...I\'m probably not that good in terms of process, and driving process across a Sales team or a sales org, I look to be able to buddy up with somebody that\'s really good at that, right? So that\'s how I think about the two. I\'m working on that right now, and there\'s a few individuals that I work with in my leadership group that are really good at thinking about structuring a Sales process, and thinking about daily inputs, and pipeline, and what that means. I\'m just not good at that right now. So I try to learn as much from that individual, but continue to focus on my strengths, which is building connections, and building meaningful relationships, and being able to be deep and intimate with my team, and in what they care about, and how they want to develop. And that\'s how about that, the two compliment each other. Naber:\xa0 Awesome, man. That\'s great. All right, let\'s make a jump into WeWork. Talk about, when you left LinkedIn, how and why you made that jump, what you\'re responsible for right now, and then I\'ve got a few more questions around some of the things that you, one took from LinkedIn into WeWork, and two how you\'re applying some of the things that I\'m going to ask about at WeWork as well. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, absolutely. So it\'s funny, it was about 14 months ago, two weeks before my kids were born. And a friend of mine from Yahoo!, he messaged me, he was now WeWork, and he said, we\'re growing crazy. We\'re looking for great Sales leaders in Asia. And I said, absolutely not not the right time, about to have twin boys. And I love what I do. I\'m at LinkedIn. I love what I do right now. He was like, I think you should have a chat. So had a chat with them. His name is Nick W. and just absolutely loved the conversation. I said, okay, well let\'s speak to some more people that WeWork, had a few more conversations. And that was the crux at how this began, was that there was just some really talented, really thoughtful, really ambitious people that I kept speaking to. And that was number one reason of why I thought to move forward with this path to WeWork, was the talent. The second was really around the mission of the company. And as you know as well being at LinkedIn, super powerful, true north mission of connecting professionals to create opportunity. And we saw that manifest itself in so many stories, which is incredible. So I always told myself, if I\'m going to to go to another company, it\'s going to be with one of the mission that I truly care about. And what I saw there was that LinkedIn was really good at connecting professionals online for them to make an impact in their career and their lives. And WeWork was really looking to do that offline, in physical space and physical environments. And I was like, that\'s really cool. It\'s almost like, it\'s almost going back in time. That should have happened first. But WeWorks actually bringing more of that personal touch and element back to networks, which LinkedIn did really good at scaling that digitally. And WeWork\'s mission of helping people create a life, not just the living. To be able to work in beautiful spaces, and accomplish great things. And when I when I was at LinkedIn in Hong Kong, we had a beautiful space, right? And we took it for granted. People would come in, and we bring clients, and groups, and students, all kinds of people. We turn them around, and 10 times out of 10 people would say, I would love to work in an environment this. And I started to think, man, everyone should be able to work in a beautiful environment. Everyone should be able to really enjoy the environment that they\'re working in. Not that\'s just aesthetically pleasing, but also has a community that brings it to life. So that that was a really big part of how I thought about WeWork. Lastly is the growth story, right? I think about transformation and the adventure of going to Italy. I just thought about how do I continue to learn and transform myself? And this is an opportunity to go back in time to a company, that still trying to figure out a lot of things, that has a really great growth trajectory. And I wanted to be a part of that, and take a lot of what I\'ve learned, to apply it to this to the story. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. That\'s great dude. so, I have three questions about this, and then we\'ll wrap. First one is, you\'ve been at a few different businesses that are known for having kick ass cultures, really good cultures. And that has gotta be ingrained into the fabric of what people do at all times in order for it to actually sustain and persist over time. What have you noticed as the common themes...and it\'s still the honeymoon period right now for WeWork, but at the same time, when you know what a movie looks and you\'ve seen the movie before, it can be a little bit different, but you know that you it and you recognize the things that you seen in the other movies that you like. Right? So when you think about LinkedIn, think about the things you really to Yahoo!, what you\'re seeing right now at WeWork, what are some commonalities between those businesses, that they have in their cultures, that every business should subscribe to, and try to do really well? Because it makes all the difference. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, absolutely. So I think, the first thing that comes to mind, which I think is probably most powerful is this idea of collaboration, right? This idea, at WeWork we we call it, "We over Me". There was such a team type of mentality, even though you were in individual Sales sometimes, at Yahoo!. And then at LinkedIn we talked so much about building connective tissue across our teams, and building collaborative cultures, and a lot of that manifests in the way we went to market, right? And a lot of the way we conducted our business. And it\'s our first value at WeWork as well, is "We over Me". Which is, there\'s no individual that can come in and try to accomplish great things themselves, right? The minute we can come together, and think about how to tackle big challenges, big problems, difficult clients, complex situations, collectively, that\'s how we\'re going to be successful. And that manifests in our products as well at WeWork, right? These beautiful spaces that we\'re delivering, we try to have this idea of community, where people can at some point come together and collaborate, and innovate, and discuss, and drive their businesses forward. And that\'s been the common thread, I think, across all these companies. There\'s no type of type of me or individual attitude, it\'s we\'re going to win and fail together, and that\'s going to be our mentality. Naber:\xa0 That\'s great man. Thanks. That\'s a good example. And when you\'re...This is specifically a WeWork question. When you think about the power of a workspace, the power of an office space, for those that are either doubters or neutral on the value of that to a team, from an engagement, performance, happiness, etc perspective, can you give us a couple passion points, or reasons why, or maybe points that would turn their mindset around? Or something that would say this is really important to think about, and this is why you should be thinking about it for your teams? Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, absolutely. So I\'ll give you, I\'ll give you two examples for me, personal first hand, around the two different space environments that I was a part of, at LinkedIn in Hong Kong, and now here at WeWork, at Chelsea HQ. Which is kind of a sandbox for a lot of our products. It\'s not what we advise for clients because it\'s absolute chaos...It\'s eclectic for sure. When I think about workspace, I don\'t think it is much as what it looks, and the feel. I mean that\'s really important, and having different types of areas for different groups or different cohorts - whether that\'s focused work, whether that\'s collaborative areas. I think more around the energy and the activation side of it. At LinkedIn in Hong Kong for example, we had about 14,000 square feet and about 50 employees. And it was really hard to drum up the right amount of energy because it was just too much space that we weren\'t utilizing. So put aside the financial aspect of like, I think we have too much space based upon our employee count. It was just really hard to get a lot of energy from that. So a lot of what we think about it WeWork is how do we create those right density levels that you\'re not on top of each other, but you\'re creating the right amount of energy. And we have so much data on so many companies that we\'re working with, especially our Enterprise customers which now makes up more than 40% of our customer base. We\'re able to design really cool spaces that activates, and creates the right amount of energy, at the right density levels for organizations. Corridors, we consciously put them in in a certain type of depth or whatever the metrics you want to use, so that people you have collision zones. And you might be able to say, hey, good to see you, haven\'t seen each other in awhile. And you create these interactions through how we design spaces. At WeWork, in HQ here, we\'ve really pushed the envelope in terms of density levels, and there\'s a lot of individuals working in different types of environments. And what that\'s done is it\'s created an energy level that\'s infectious, right? That there\'s just a lot of excitement, a lot of excitement about what you do. There\'s constant interactions happening every single day because of how the space is designed. So, I think the takeaway for me in that, is really thinking about space in terms of what type of energy are you looking to have? What type of activation do you want to have from your employees? And being able to build beautiful spaces around that. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Those are some good little tips and tactics for how space can create, almost, not accidental, because it\'s purposeful, but a meaningful interactions between individuals between work, as well as while they work. That\'s really interesting. Okay, I\'ve got one more for you, and then we\'ll wrap. So the last one I want to talk about is something that you pulled from, my guess, both your time at Yahoo! and your time at LinkedIn. And I want to know how you\'re applying it, at WeWork. So, you\'ve talked about, and I know people on your team were big on...you\'ve also gone through some training on this, is my guess...is the power of storytelling. And using that as a vehicle to inspire - inspire customers, inspire teams, etc. So how do you think about the power of storytelling? What\'s a framework that you use? And how are you bringing that to life at WeWork, maybe with a couple of examples, that you\'ve applied since you\'ve been there? Or just generally how you\'re applying it. Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So I think storytelling is such a powerful mechanism to inspire, and to motivate, and to bring ideas and experiences to life. I learned a lot about the power of storytelling through when I was running the transformation theme for LinkedIn a couple of years ago. So every year we focused on one culture or value and we tried to drive that home across our global Sales organization. A couple of years ago, it was the idea of transformation. And we thought early on, how do we bring this idea of transformation to life? We\'re gonna bring it to life through storytelling. So we\'re going to create a framework for transformation, and then we\'re going to share that through stories throughout the entire year. The culture of transformation at LinkedIn, we talk about it as transformation of self, company and world. There was a particular story of transformation that was really powerful. This woman in Australia, she really struggled early on in her role. And she also struggled at home. Her son was very sick. And she had to overcome both of those challenges. And she was able to do that through the people that she worked with, and her leader, And through the support of the people that she worked with. And she told this fascinating story that ended up with her son becoming very healthy through support, as well as her becoming very successful in her role. And through through that story, people read and were able to understand how people\'s lives can be transformed both personally and professionally. And one way I\'m bringing that to WeWork, is right now in the moment we feel like there\'s a lot on our shoulders. We\'re at a stage of the company, where there\'s a lot going on... Naber:\xa0 Massive compounding growth, $47 billion valuation, Pre IPO, rapido with employees, tons of stuff on your shoulders, lots of spotlight as well. I totally get that. Makes Sense. Nick DeMarinis: Exactly. So among all of that, it\'s hard to keep your eye on the future, right? And I try to always think about that. I think about the story that we\'re going to go tell a year, two, five years from now. And there\'s an exercise that I to do that I\'m going to be doing with my leadership team coming up, which is, I might be getting the name wrong, but I think it\'s called "doom or boom" storytelling, right? So what we want to do is like, we\'re each going to tell a story around two paths. Let\'s tell a story about, let\'s just say this gets screwed, right? Where this is going to be a doom, what goes wrong? Okay, we\'re, going to hire the wrong people, we\'re going to miss all of our Sales targets, we\'re going to lose our culture. And I think I want to hear those stories of where things go wrong. And then the story of where things go really well, right? If we\'re going to be really successful in the next year or two, what has to go right? Well, we brought great people on board. We were selling some of the biggest contracts ever. Whatever it is. And what that does is it helps us really illustrating and picture what those stories could look like. More importantly, I think it helps us identify the trends. Trends in the bad story that we want to make sure we get ahead of now. So there\'s always a common trends you start to see in these really bad stories. It\'s like, cool, what can we do to resource and get ahead of these right now so this doesn\'t happen. Cool, let\'s do that. And then the story that goes really well, focusing on strengths, right? Let\'s make sure we double down on those efforts. Whatever\'s going really well, how do we invest more time and resources in that? So I think the power of storytelling is really important to bringing experiences to life as well as thinking ahead of what you want your stories to be. Let\'s think about those on two different tracks, and let\'s learn from both of those. Naber:\xa0 Love it, man. That\'s great. All right. You\'ve been super generous with your time. I really appreciate it. And I\'ve got two rapid fire questions for you, and then we\'ll break. Okay. First one, you\'ve been in some really high stress jobs. You\'ve been in some time intensive jobs. what are your best two or three tips on work-life balance? Nick DeMarinis: Yeah, I got two that I feel pretty strong about. One is, I make this place work for me, not work for this place, right? So I don\'t let a company or role dictate how I need to think about my family, my wellness. I make sure that I integrate that in, and I\'m very vocal about that. That leads into the second part of it. Second part is just work life balance is to communicate it. I don\'t think there\'s really such thing as work life balance. I think it\'s harmony. Our lives are just way more connected than we possibly think. But a lot of us are afraid to talk about what we care about and what\'s matters to us outside of work. Whether that\'s my kids and dogs, whether that\'s someone that loves to go to to concerts or they have, they\'re really passionate about wellness. My biggest tip on that is just let\'s talk about it. Let\'s let\'s share with our peers, and our bosses, and those around us, what we do, what we care about and how do we can integrate that. Let\'s set expectations around how we work, and how we communicate, what\'s off limits, what are our pet peeves. And I think that\'s probably the two things that are more most passionate me. I don\'t try to find that balance. I try to find harmony in the two, and I figure out ways to make that work. And the second is, I over communicate. Everyone here knows that I try to get home for bath time by seven, because I really care about that with my kids. But I wake up at six, and I\'m more than happy to take a phone call at six in the morning, right? Everyone\'s different. I want to get to know on my team, what they care about, how they to work. I think too many times we think about work life and we try to figure it out ourselves. I think we just need to get it out there, and let\'s talk about that with our team, let\'s talk about how we solve that. And it can be a really, really healthy conversation. Naber:\xa0 Nice, love it. Last question, it\'s got two parts. Because I want to talk about your twins for a second...and that\'ll be the second part. First one is - and my audience knows this, but I\'m going to explain for the guests, I asked this question on people\'s birthdays every single year - what is the most important learning or lesson you\'ve acquired in the last 12 months, professionally? Nick DeMarinis: Most important learning or lesson that I\'ve acquired in the past 12 months professionally. That\'s a really great, that\'s a really great question. I would say it\'s gotta be around this idea of being vulnerable, and there\'s no such thing as a dumb question, something around that. I don\'t know the best way to frame it. But I think, for me, life and your career, you never have it figured out. There\'s never a role, or a company, or a function, where you\'re like, I\'ve got it figured out. My biggest learning is to have just a really high sense of curiosity. To always be able to ask the questions, figure out how and why things work. Be very vulnerable to say, I don\'t know, I don\'t know the answer, or I don\'t know this yet. Can you help walk me through that? More so in the past four and a half months from WeWork than the previous...at LinkedIn I felt like I had a lot of it figured out. Where here I\'m in this really uncomfortable situation where I\'m trying to still figure a lot of it out. So being very vulnerable, and being able to be like, hey, I don\'t have it figured out. I have a lot of questions. Help me, walk me through this. That\'s the biggest lesson that I\'ve learned in the last few months. Naber:\xa0 Good one. I like it. Part B is, you are a fresh, little over one year dad of twinsies - twin boys, identical twin boys. I read a statistic the other day that between 88 and 90% of the human population reproduces. So the odds of someone listening on this podcast, are that they have kids, will have kids, or at least they know someone very close to them. So, what is the most important learning or your lesson you\'ve acquired in the last 12 months, being the father of one year old twin boys? Nick DeMarinis: Yeah. Good question. There\'s a lot. Can we extend this an hour? Naber:\xa0 Yeah, sure. Go for it. Get out your calendar, get ready audience, here we go. Nick DeMarinis: For me, I think the biggest parallel of being father and a leader is, is around sacrifice, right? I think I\'ve always loved seeing others succeed, and be able to sacrifice my time to help others be successful, or trying my best at that. Becoming a father of the last year, you just realize how much you have to sacrifice to be able to support these tiny humans as they go through these different stages of development. And there\'s so many parallels there. And you do have to sacrifice a lot. Me and my wife, we\'ve really had work together around what the sacrifice looks like, and how do we do the best for our kids. It\'s helped me realize the bigger picture, that the day to day of our lives and of work is trivial compared to the bigger picture of why we are here on this earth. Raising kids, and just getting so excited about each stage of development, and what their life is going to be like years from now. I think that same way around my team here, and what they\'re learning now, and what they\'re going through is really challenging. But they\'re going to get through it, it\'s transformation. And I can\'t wait to see what they grow up to be in their personal professional lives years from now. So I think, there\'s a couple things to unpack there. I think the amount of sacrifice that you have to to help yourself and to help others really starts to become apparent when you\'re a parent. This idea of just really looking at the big picture of development, and the story of of your children growing up, as well as the teams that you\'re working with, and what their careers could look like. It gets you to start thinking way further ahead than just the day-to-day in front of you. Naber:\xa0 Hey everybody, thanks so much for listening.

Naber:\xa0 Nicolas, awesome to have you on the show. How are you? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 I\'m doing fantastic. Thank you for having me. Naber:\xa0 Yes, I\'m so glad to have you. Hearing your French accent makes me think about the French holiday I just had, the French holiday that you just had, in addition to being in Greece and having all the amazing food. I am so excited to have you on. I\'ve learned a lot from you in a short space of time when we\'ve worked together in the past. Gotten to know you a little bit personally. Many of the people I\'ve worked with have gotten to know you personally and professionally, and there\'s just so many good things to say about you, as a person and as a professional operator. So I\'m more than excited for the audience to hear what you have to say. So why don\'t we jump in? What I think we\'ll do is, we\'ll get into some of the professional jumps that you\'ve had through your career, talk about your career, as well as a bunch of the frameworks, the mindset you have, some of the methods that you\'ve gone through and used in your playbook, if you will. But first, I think it\'d be helpful, if it\'s okay with you, is to start to get to know you a little bit personally so that they can build up the same fascination as I have with you as an individual, and maybe we\'ll start back in the day, if you will. Maybe, we\'ll start in your childhood. So why don\'t we start with...I mean, you grew up in France, you were based in Strasbourg, you were born in Strabourg and grew up there, you were based in Frankfurt, then Strasbourg again, San Francisco, you\'ve got so many global experiences. What was it like as a kid growing up as Nicolas Draca? And what are some of the things you\'re interested in? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So I grew up in France, in Strasbourg - border with Germany - East. And what was it to be Nicolas Draca? Well, I would say not much, pretty shy kid. Just following my friends wherever they would go. I was not the leader, that\'s for sure. I was average in every single sport. I was okay with it, no ego there. It\'s just, like, anything I would play, I was just average. I think that summaries what it was when I was young. I think school, I was average. Sport, I was average. I think great friends. I lived in the countryside. So after school, I was more about going outside, playing in the forest, playing with my bike. And that was my life as a young kid. Naber:\xa0 Very cool. And what were some of your hobbies, your interests as you were growing up? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 It was being outside, and I think this is still the case today. We lived in a small village. There were like 200 people, in my class were nine, on my level. Being with friends, outside, playing whatever, playing soccer, running around, jumping on our bike, whatever you can imagine. Naber:\xa0 Very cool. Very cool. And as you\'re going through high school, were there certain subjects or anything you acceled at where you thought at a young age, you were pretty good at it naturally? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. I specialized pretty quickly in math and physics. I have boys. I was a boy. I was just going with the flow. I\'m just no big plan, no ambition, no nothing. To be fair, ,when I talk to friends today, and they look like where I am today, they struggled to connect between what I was when I was young, and what I do today. Like, really? That\'s what you\'ve done and that\'s who you are. So yeah, just I go back to that just an average kid. Naber:\xa0 It\'s funny, I\'m laughing so much, and I have to hold it in because of the microphone, but I\'m laughing. That\'s really interesting...What did your parents do for a living? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 My father was a Sales guy, and my mother was a teacher. And then my father moved from Sales in consulting to building his own company. Actually he created two companies, two startups. Naber:\xa0 Wow. So that was in your genesY Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Part of the education was you started in a job early, starting when you\'re 16 - it\'s like, first job, same for my sister, I have one sister. And you\'re going to have to work. Yeah, that was in our genes, that\'s for sure. Naber:\xa0 Very interesting. And what was the first thing you did to make money? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 The first thing I did to make money was to work in a restaurant as a waiter. And then the second thing, I ended up driving ambulance. Naber:\xa0 Whoa. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. That was my summer job. So this was when I was 18, you\'ll can only drive in France when you\'re 18. That was something really unique, learned a ton from it, specifically on the people side. And I think if I didn\'t have started computer science at that time, maybe I would have moved into being a doctor or something in the medicine field. Naber:\xa0 Wow. What were some of the things that you learned? You\'re probably about to say that. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. Wow. So when you drive when you drive an ambulance, you drive people from home to the hospital, or you drive them back. So quite quickly you understand and you see where they live, and you see all type of people, all social aspects of it. And so that was one part of it, which when you\'re young, I was like 18, 19, that\'s just wow, it was pretty surprise, I\'d say. The other thing is, we will also doing ER type of thing, I don\'t know how we say it in English, but like we would go...there are car accidents, and we would go there and pick up the people. And yeah, we did a couple of ones where...once we went for somebody who committed suicide to pick \'em up. Naber:\xa0 Wow. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 so it\'s a, I mean a, you guys can go a little bit on it to give you an idea, but the, you arrive there and the person tried to, cut is they yeah. And yeah, but, but survived it. And so it was really a weird kind of set up because you arrived, you don\'t know the person, so you\'re completely disconnected. whereas there\'s a lot of drama going on around the seminary. You come here and you just try to do your job and then you have those weird part of the story where actually, which we have to do is to chase a cat with trying to leak the blog. We\'re story, but we ended up running in the k frame to chase that cat was trying to lead all the blog. yeah. Yeah. It\'s just kind of weird setup slash weird experience and we had many of those, which I\'m not sure I want to share. Naber:\xa0 Oh Wow. That\'s an amazing short story. You walked into a storm on a bottle and you have to write into the bottle every single time. Yeah. Yup, Yup, Yep, Yup, Yup. Wow. That is, that\'s probably the most interesting answer I\'ve gotten to that question. That\'s a really good answer. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 It says a, it was a unique experience actually. I a I still remember that, that job and I think I got lucky to get that job for a couple of months, a few years. And yeah. Do you find a lot? I think where I am today. Naber:\xa0 Very cool. Wow. You always learned something really interesting about somebody. You have these types of conversations, so you\'re in Strasburg, driving ambulances, working at restaurants, being, being, being, being a average, probably not average. You\'re probably overselling the average part of it. But, so then you\'re making decisions about where you want to go to school for university. how, what\'s the decision you make at that point? And tell us, walk us through, your decision around school. After, after high school Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 I started, I had the chance of a started coding when I was young, like 11 year old. I\'m 46 today, so 11 mean like in 84. at that time, you do not have access to computer, but we were lucky that intermediate school, we had computer. I think there was somebody who was passionate about it, was able to get a couple of computer for us. And so I\'d have passion for it. Then decided quickly to move into computer science. I\'m a major, and then got my bachelor in computer science. And then, my idea was you\'re going to find this weird, I wanted to work in a golf. I played golf. I loved it. I taught my other job, my third job on the weekend. And super weird. So I interviewed for a golf school, to be in management. And at the same time I interview for interview for a business school, meaning to go through the process to be accepted and went for business school and went from my business school aftermy computer degree, the master in business and then, took my first job. Naber:\xa0 Wow. Not In the Gulf company. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 no, not a in a golf company. I still, I don\'t play actually anymore. but at that age, I don\'t know. And my parents were highly supportive. They\'re hey, you want to go? Even though you graduated for computer science, who went to be in the gold business? Go for it. so I had the oldest support up to me to make some decision, super happy about what happened. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Cool. I wouldn\'t want to, I wouldn\'t want to compete with you on the links. I\'m sure that you\'re much better than you\'re saying you right now. So let that, does that get us to GE Capital? Is that the first role out of school? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. Out of school. My first job was, a Sales guy at GE Capital. And here I was selling infrastructure, so laptop, desktop servers, printers applications, for a large company in the east of France. So that\'s what my first job and that\'s where I met. I started the same day somebody called a Duchenne. Why cool. Founded a pencil, later on with Naber:\xa0 very cool. And so you were up, that\'s really interesting story. I\'m sure we\'ll get to that in a second also. And you were obviously quite technical walking into that role. Was that really helpful walking in as with the quite technical mind to get into an account management slash Sales role at GE Capital and for it solutions? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah, it was, it was a, it wasn\'t nice to have actually two is not that complex. A, it was a new laptop computer, right? Yeah. To have a passion for it. So I had a passion for it, but not treating immediate at that stage. like here was really hardcore Sales. It was my first job, in back in the day you would start, there was no internet then I\'m going to speak like an old guy. So actually you had the yellow pages. That\'s what I remember. And I was pretty shy. Like you have to remember that the, why am I in trail? Good question. and on a on day one, I get the yellow pages, which is not the best way to onboard somebody and say, hey, good luck and go and try to sell. And I had the number of to deliver on. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 the story is as well as the on friends factors actually what is happening in inferences. Sometimes they do a writing test where they analyze how you write. I think it tell them that country, I\'m not sure. Yeah. Long Story Short, I started day one and then my boss come to see me and saying, hey, they just finished on an icing your the way you\'re right and we cannot keep you because more or less a summary, you get a report, three pages on the report. and the reports say you\'re a loser and you will never be able to handle pressure, and grow in your career. So are, you\'re going to have to leave tonight, and you can not stay. And I\'m what? So it came back pretty upset to meet with the VP of Sales of GE. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Excellent. its in Paris and then hey, that, that\'s not how it\'s gonna play out. Right. You were first from a legal standpoint, you\'re not allowed to do that. Number two, it\'s highly, disrespectful to onboard needs to get started to two and then decide after day one based on how I write. I agree with that. My writing is terrible, but then decide who I am as a person. so I kept that, I kept the report, and I showed it to my kids later. I\'m yes, that\'s what your dad was. That\'s where happened. So that was my first job, actually. They one I came back home. Naber:\xa0 Well Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 I\'m I\'m I was already withmy wife. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Oh my gosh. so in a marathon you\'re not supposed to pre sprint from the start, but we are sprinting with good stories so far. This is hilarious and great. It\'s just excellent. So, what is the, what\'s the biggest thing you learned at GE Capital? And then we\'ll talk about your jump to CSC. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So a g tactical here was, so, I learned what it cost to be on the first real job and being a Sales person, what it took and how to be a, leave you smart. And what I mean by that is how can you make your quota the fastest way possible. and here we add professional services on one end, which was like 30% margin. We had a infrastructure which was 5% margin. And of course my quota was based on a much more genuine would bring to the table and decided where as we were in a selling hardware emotion in the company, decided to do all of my business in services, and professional services, sorry. This is my learning is what is the fastestto achieving, to beating quota was the learning of spending a couple of years at GE. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Nice. That\'s great. Yeah. You\'ve quoted a couple of times. whatever you\'re doing, somebody else\'s probably done it better than you. Don\'t reinvent the wheel, learn from others and be lazy, smarter. Yeah. I really liked that quote. And it\'s obviously something you can learn really early in your career. okay. Yeah, Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 I actually have the, it\'s a, it\'s a big, big one is a, it\'s trying to look and does, this is what I did unconsciously though looking around me and there was one Sales rep who was highly successful and one was working really hard but not like I was working like 14 hours a day, but not being as successful. So I loved that the successful one. And I tried to understand the dynamic of the deals then and learn from it, then cloned it. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Excellent. Okay. So you\'re at GE Capital, you\'re learning a lot about what it\'s like to carry a bag, be a Sales person for the first time, you\'re making a jump to CSC. What did you make the jump to CSC, and what were you doing at that job? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yes, so CSC, one of my friends was leading one of the team at CSC, Computer Science Corporation, it was in the outsourcing business and it was focusing on transformation. And transformation at CSC will assign hundred of millions of dollars of deals where they will start outsourcing both infrastructure and people, and moving them into CSC. And our friend was putting a team together to help him through this transformation phase. And so you will work on an account for like 6 to 12 months max. And your job would be as fast as possible to be able either from an infrastructure standpoint, from a people standpoint, from a process standpoint, to migrate to CSC. So here it opened up to all of Europe because all of those contracts where across Europe or across the world and more of an international angle to what I was doing before. Naber:\xa0 Very good. Okay. And so you made that jump, and Program Manager. So day to day, what are you doing? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah, day-to-day the way it would work is we would be in charge of projects, all of those transformation projects. And depending on the project we had lined up, or our goal would be to work with a set of people...I had a couple of project manager working for me, you will have infrastructure people, you will have architects, you will have procurement, and so on. And just being able to orchestrate and to coordinate all of it to deliver on time. So the way it would work is as part of the process before starting on anything, you would send a quote to your customers saying this is a how many hours I\'m going to spend, and this is how much it\'s going to cost. So you just ship within the hours you\'re committed to. Naber:\xa0 Are you creating that estimate or is someone else creating it and you\'re delivering on it? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 No, I have to create that estimate. And it was like massive, like millions of dollars every time. So, it was the first time I worked on really, really large contracts, so pretty exciting. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Excellent. Okay. So you\'re at CSC, this is what you\'re doing day to day, and you are six and a half, seven years into your career at this point, your belt to make your first major entrepreneurial jump for Ipanto. Tell us about why you decided to start Ipanto, and the story for how it started, as well how you\'re ultimately acquired by Infoblox, which sounds like a great story. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So what happened is...one of the projects we were managing - so I was still working with my friend Eric from GE, we went together to CSC - and one of the projects we were working on is IP address management. So what was happening is people were trying to find a way to manage their IP addresses on their network. And they were using spreadsheets, which seems surprising, but that was more or less the go-to. And if you think about it like every single device, like your laptop here, your printer, whatever, has an IP address. And as you can imagine pretty quickly, you can not keep up. If you have 5,000 employee, and I don\'t know 3-4 IP addresses per employee, you cannot manage IP addresses in a spreadsheet. Then we looked at it for a customer and realized, that there was only one company that was doing that as a software, and they were charging per active IP per year, and it was $1.50. And with the explosion of IP addresses, we looked at it and were like, oh man, we have to create a company. So we started looking what other competitors were doing on the side, and at some point decided to create our own company...We had hired...So what we\'re doing is more or less, we stayed at CSC as consultants. So we work for them. So our daytime job was CSC. Our nighttime job was building our company, which many people do. So it was all bootstrapped and it took us like a couple of years to get an MVP and we started closing customers. And we did a decent job I think on the Marketing side, we did a decent job on our footprint where people believed we were a large company. With Skype you could open...we had, not fake, but we had numbers in Australia - a phone number in Australia, we have numbers in the US - phone numbers. So, as we had global reach, we will send quote like across the globe, and we would time our email to look like we were in the region. We also created a set of names, so I had multiple names. I was Shawn, the product manager. I was Nicolas, the CMO. I was also John, from support. And so emails we\'re going out, and we automated all of it, to make you believe that we were a large organization, but to ensure that people could engage with us through support, which we call customer success today. Or through the product team, saying hey, what do you think about the solution? And so on and so on. So, yeah, that\'s what we did. Naber:\xa0 So you\'re effectively like the equivalent of a chatbot with all of your names, and you are your own follow the sun model, as in like you did everything probably 24 hours during the day. How many people did you eventually have a on the team? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 So we went up to 10 employees, mostly engineers. So we build a small engineering team in Strasbourg. And then we had that rule, as a Sales leader you would appreciate it, and this was coming from my father. So my father, had a rule for a Sales rep that if you go to Paris at that time, you need to have three meetings a day. If you travel three meetings a day. We applied the same rule at the European level. So if we had people pinging us from any country, and we were able to secure a free meetings a day, we\'ll go and we\'ll take a flight. So we went to Dubai multiple times. We went to Saudi Arabia. We went to Turkey. Meaning that\'s where inbound was coming from. Was it rational in terms of like weighted pipeline and how much money we would make, it was not, we did not have that experience. What is it efficient in term of meetings? Yes, it was. And then we were having long meetings and we built partnerships across most of the Europe, which was pretty cool at that time, and got us to meet some great prospects. And then at some point, we decided...two things happened. I\'m going to get you to Infoblox. One is...I don\'t know for what reason actually, I can not recall...we decided to raise funding. And the plan was, with my associate, he said, hey, you know what, you\'re going to go to the valley, and you\'re going to meet with VC. And I never met with VC before, nor have I ever put a business plan together the way a VC in the valley would expect it. So, one of the leaders in the space, Infoblox, just raised 20 million at that point. We send an email through some connection, and we end up with like 20 meetings in one week. I\'m like, rule of 3, works. Jump on a plane. And I went there alone, when I think about it, it\'s pretty, I don\'t know if it was stupid, but it was interesting. Went there alone with my deck, seven slides. And my first meeting, I think it was Accel, I end up with like five people in the room, like partners. Tell me about your company and so on. I go through the meeting, I explained what I could explain. Was pretty weak on the finance side of the deck, which was the last part of the deck, focusing more on the customers we had, and the dynamic of the business, and the size of the market. But more or less, I did one meeting after the other like this. We didn\'t raise any funding, to be clear. Somebody told us unless I can call you at 11 first to have lunch together, we\'re not gonna work together...But we learn a ton through the process. We started discovering how people think here. How do they see the world? How do they manage their businesses? And actually, on the last two or three meetings, people just starting giving us advice, which I highly respect the US for...anybody, like trying to grow a company or be an entrepreneur in general. And people are really nice and friendly to give us advice about what we should do next, and how we should think about our business...And in parallel what we did is we ended up working on a deal with a company called PG&E. So coming from France, I have no bloody clue who PG&E was. It\'s not that I haven\'t done my homework, but we had all that inbound and we were just...And so we ended up in final on PG&E against a company called Infoblox. And we didn\'t win, whereas we had the support from the engineering team. And then Infoblox reach out to us getting really upset just starting to see us in deals, incuding that large PG&E deal. And the BD person, as well as the GM for Europe, Karl, ping\'d us and said, I need to meet you. I need to spend time with you. I need to understand who you are. And this is where the initial discussion started. Naber:\xa0 Wow. Really interesting. Someone to reach out to directly from Infoblox and said, we need to meet you. Were you pretty guarded with those conversations? Did you feel like it was a com-partnership, or did you feel like it was more like them kind of feeling you out as competition? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yes. So we already had another competitor in the space who approached us, and our first feedback was we\'re not going to talk to. Like, we don\'t want to talk to you. And Karl, Karl changed our life somehow. We saw him at a show, and he\'s like, I want to see your product, like, show me, show me, show me. And we\'re nah, dude, we don\'t want to, we already had this. It happened two weeks ago. We were again pretty young, and we\'re like, no way, we\'re not showing you your product. That\'s not going to happen. Screw that. And then he pushed again and got the VP of Marketing and the VP of Sales to ping us and they say, hey, you know what we\'re going to do? Actually we\'re going to fly to Santa Clara. And you\'re going to come and present, and we\'re going to sign an NDA, pay for your travel, and everything. And at that point we\'re like, okay, again the rule of a couple of meetings, let\'s go to the valley. And then based on our learnings, meeting with all the VC in the valley, we were really set up for success in the meeting we would have there - understanding how they think, understanding how they approach things, and being able to engage in the right way through all the meetings. So it ended up being a successful week. There was really a good fit between their team and our team. They really love our technology and loved the way we were working. And then we quickly within a few months closed the deal, sold the company, and moved everybody in California, the engineers, and so on. Naber:\xa0 Wow. That\'s great. You\'ve been a part of...you were required Infoblox at Ipanto, you had Talentoday that you\'re an investor in who was acquired by Medix in 2018, you\'ve been a part of multiple IPO businesses. Do you have any advice for people going through that acquisition process, especially as a founder, especially as a Senior leader on the exec team? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 I think when when you go for that process you need to be...so a couple of things. One, we were pretty clear that based on our skillset, and based on our capacity to raise funding, we could not grow the company more. Okay. It didn\'t end up being a large company, it was a small startup, but we were aware and self aware that hey, we reached our limit. And so we decided to go on the path to...It\'s not like a week before Infoblox ping\'d us we were like, we\'re going to sell. Like I think we built and designed the company for six months with a path to sell the company. So that was one. There was no ego involved on this one - that was the second one. And number three goes back to what you want to do as part of that opportunity. Right? You as a leader, do you want to be part of the adventure still? Or, I\'m going to sell and stay six months and go. For us, again, we were clear we wanted to sell. We still believe in our product, and we wanted to push it and get that product / solution successful and growing, becoming the leader on IP address management. That\'s what our dream. And we executed on it. The last piece is of course, culture fit, or the fit with the team that are going to acquire you. Pretty often what you see, you get acquired and then everybody disappears, right? And you\'re not even sure your product is gonna survive that acquisition. And here for us it was really, really important that, we would get on well with the people that are acquiring us, that we were clear that we would be part of the adventure moving forward, and we could still execute on our vision to lead or yeah, to own IP address management, which was what we were doing. And this is what we did. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Excellent. It\'s a really good segue into Infoblox and you building the Demand Marketing function there. So as someone that went through an acquisition, you\'re founder or co-founder of the company going into that new company, tell us about what you were doing at Infoblox. And can you give it to us from the perspective of someone who just got acquired? Because someone that is thinking of their business with an exit strategy, it might be good for them to also hear it from a lens of, we were acquired and this was what it was like in the aftermath or the afterlife in the new company. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So first we were acquired. It took us some time to understand that...it was by a smart team. We did not realize - we just moved to the Bay, we had no sense of the dynamic here. It took me like a couple of years actually. I understood they were smart, but those people, it was their 4th IPO. They we\'re trying to go to their next IPO, they\'ve done three of them. I was like, cool, what is an IPO? Congratulations. But the quality of talent that they assemble and the success they had in the past, I think just facilitated the vision of how we would work together. But again, this we didn\'t know about, right. I learned it later. But quickly, we agreed...We had a bonus structure based on revenue of our company, revenue of our product, sorry. And what happened, and I think you\'re going to love that one. So, Ipanto the IP address management product, was a highly successful lead gen product. Why? Because replace your spreadsheet to manage IP addresses was something everybody would understand and would get excited about, versus the other products that Infoblox that had at the end of the day are not that sexy, and actually you\'re competing with free. So it was kind of a Trojan horse. And the Sales strategy, which I didn\'t know, was to use our product to enter into accounts, to start a discussion. But the goal is to sell the other products. Naber:\xa0 You\'re the land. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah, I\'m the land play, but on the discussion, not even selling it. And I got pretty quickly upset about it because again, we had with my buddy a vision that we wanted to lead IP address management, and they were using our leads just to do that, which is to land a discussion. And the piece you\'re gonna like is what I\'m going to tell you now, is at some point this was also channel business. Okay. And they were not managing all the leads. And I found a channel partner to take over all the leads. So I went to see the Head of Sales, and I\'m like, Hey, your team doesn\'t seem that excited. I have a bonus tied to it. And we went to execute on the vision, it\'s all good - and I was like, Director in that company, Director of Demand Gen, I was a nobody - and I\'m like, I\'m going to move over all the leads to that channel partner, and actually I\'m going to Seattle to train them next week. Okay. And at that point, my boss, the VP, Marketing came andsaid hey, we are we going to have a timeout - like, you have to stop. And I\'m like, why?...We understand you have a bonus tied to everything. We\'re going to pay your bonuses, we\'re good. And we are going to stick back to our strategy. But I think they did appreciate the commitment and the passion around that, saying, hey that\'s cool. Now can you do what you do to the rest of the business, and not focus only on your world? Naber:\xa0 Wow, really interesting. I mean you brought an entrepreneurial, founder mindset and you went in hot with an executive that\'s the Head of Sales. And that is not an easy thing to unlearn that mindset once you\'re running a startup, once you\'re a founder of a business, that is not an easy thing to unlearn when you go into a larger environments. I\'m sure they really appreciated both the structure and method of the problem solving, as well like you said, the dedication to solving the problem, which is great. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. And it\'s not being a jerk as part of the process. What I say sometimes to my team...we were at some point, agreeing in our disagreement on the vision, and it\'s about having a discussion saying, Hey, this is the issue, the way I\'m going to solve is okay, I\'m gonna move on. And I think being able to have that level of discussion in a constructive way, and agreeing in your disagreement, is always a good thing to decide what to do next. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Excellent. And I\'m sure that\'ll play a little part of talking about some different pieces of your playbook a little bit here. So we\'re gonna jump from Infoblox into LinkedIn, Twilio, and HackerRank. Heavy hitting, awesome, really interesting hyper-growth organizations that you\'ve joined at very different stages, and endured for very different stages. And you\'ve just done such amazing things at these businesses. So why don\'t you talk about the jump into Linked, what you were doing at LinkedIn, maybe for a couple minutes. And then I\'ll pull up, I want to talk about a couple of what I know are your superpowers, as you\'re going through both that role...and you can jump into examples before you get to Twilio, before you get to HackerRank. But just jump into how you joined LinkedIn and what you did there. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So when I joined LinkedIn, I focused initially on the Talent Solution business. It was before the IPO, again, I know you\'re pretty familiar with that business. And here if the goal was to build a Demand Gen engine to support that Talent Solution business. And if I recall it correctly, I\'m not 100% sure about the number, I think our prior year the revenue was like 80 million. And I come, I think their Marketing team was like 30 people all together, reporting into Nick, and my team was like two people. And I look after two weeks, and I put a plan together, super proud of how fast I did my plan. You\'ll see what happened next. I go and meet with the CMO of LinkedIn, and I\'m like, Hey, here it is. Here is my vision, this is how we are going to grow from...I\'m going to build an organization to support $500M, from $80M. And he looks at me, and he\'s like, I like your plan. It\'s a good plan. It\'s not ambitious enough. And I say, what? I\'m like, 80 to 500. He\'s like, yeah 10x. Like the rule at LinkedIn was like 10x always. And I\'m like, what about 10x? He\'s like, year, you need to build a plan for to support a $billion because Talent Solutions is going to be our first billion dollar business. And I\'m like, you\'re joking, right? He\'s like, no, no, I\'m not. Can you please come back next week with an update on your plan? And I\'m like, of course. So I go back to my cubicle work on my plan. Then he pings me, Hey, can you come to see me in my office the day after. I come to see him the day after in his office, he\'s like, Hey, I really liked your plan. This was Talent Solutions. It\'s like I just hired a lead on the Marketing side for Marketing Solutions, and I love for you to help her to build a Demand Gen engine again. And I\'m like, what are you talking about? Yesterday you told me to go from 80 to a $billion, now you asked me to to focus on this. I\'m like, I cannot do that, I have two people. He\'s like, nah, figure it out. And this is how is has been since day one. And this is where you learn the scaling muscle, hyper-growth muscle. More or less, I mean you\'ve been through that journey, being on a high speed train and building the tracks at the same time, at scale. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Speed. The ultimate function of speed. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Speed. I think it\'s the ultimate function of, okay, speed and demanding excellence, which is a core value. Because whatever you\'re going to do as an experiment, if it\'s works, you\'re going to have to 10x that experiment. And 10x can mean the same thing you build in the US is going to have to work in Europe, in Australia, in Brazil, or it\'s going to have to scale across the organization, across all business lines. And when you are initially...I remember the first couple of months being exhausted. But not exhausted because I was working, I wasn\'t working 16 hours a day, not in like number of hours. It\'s the intensity of the meeting. Like in half an hour, and again you\'ve been through that, you\'ll have a meeting in half an hour, and you come with a V1 of something, after half an hour you would be at V5. And if if you had to check your phone for two minutes during the meeting, you would be lost. Like if you did not follow the discussion, you\'re like what are you talking about? That\'s level to speed, yeah, you went back to it. Speed, demanding excellence, and all the core values of the company. Yeah, it was incredible. Naber:\xa0 Amazing. Okay. So you\'re at LinkedIn and you\'re undoubtedly iterating on and building new pieces of your playbook. One of the things that you\'ve talked about in a few different forums, you\'ve been interviewed on this, you\'ve been on stage talking about this, is your Four pillars of the Science of Marketing - Talent, Insights, Operations, and Lifecycle. What I\'d love to do is start picking apart each one of those, because we\'re at LinkedIn now and I know you\'ve developed quite a bit of muscle fiber putting together a lot of the playbook there, and then ultimately exercising it more and more, and iterating more and more at Twilio and HackerRank. Can you go through, the basics of those four pillars, and give us a little bit of sense for how your frameworks work within each of them. So maybe we can start with talent, and then move from there. Is that okay? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah, of course. So talent is about, I mean it\'s number one. And it doesn\'t come from me, it comes from LinkedIn as the driving force for success. And it\'s something I learned at LinkedIn. I appreciated at Twilio, and I appreciate it even more at HackerRank. It\'s about how you\'re going to build your team, who you\'re going to hire, and how are they going to be able to scale, right? Not having any compromise on who you\'re going to hire. And the process we had, and I think it was across the company, but you can tell me, was when you hire somebody...So first we want to somebody for their current job or their job description, but we\'re hiring somebody for their capacity to grow, and scale, and be in a job two years from now... But when you are in a high growing startup, you never hire people for what they\'re going to do the next six months. That\'s not gonna work. And the number one thing is, people who will go through the interview process will decide who will test on what, but at the end of the day when we will regroup after talking to a candidate, 100% have to be a yes. I know it was the same on your end, I think. 100% have to be yes. Otherwise, we\'ll pass on the candidate. It doesn\'t mean the candidate was a bad candidate. The guy could be like super smart, super...it\'s just, it did not work. But two things that are really important. Number one is people knew that if the said no, there will be consequences, right? Meaning that person would not get hired, right? So you have to work with people who understand that. Number two is if somebody said no, you can go back, if you have one out of seven people saying no, you had the opportunity to get back to that person and say, Hey, you are the only no, just doing one last check that you are 100% no, because we\'re going to pass on this candidate. And the person has to be, I\'m going to say smart to even maybe come back and say, hey actually let me re check my notes. Let me check that, and maybe I was wrong, which not many people are able to say. Or I was right, and I picked my my view...And I was wrong, I\'m actually a yes, and let\'s move forward. So first is no compromise on hiring talent and spend the time between needed to find the right person. The other one is hiring is a full time job. And initially when you build a team, it\'s not the thing you\'re going to do at seven at night. You just want to block your calendar to just have that muscle, and spend the time partnering with your recruiter, looking yourself in your network, and so on. But it\'s a full time job. And then when you\'ve done all that job of hiring, next step is onboarding and after it\'s nurturing, right? It\'s how you going to help people understand who they are as a professional, and what are they good at, what are they less good at, and it starts there. And what is the path for them to grow? It can be a year plan, a 2 year plan. Whatever it takes to ensure that you assembled the best team possible, a team that is going to collaborate. I think collaboration is at the heart of it. I think specifically in Marketing, I\'m not going to talk about other organizations, but in Marketing you are the center of so many things that if you don\'t have like collaboration / communication skills, it\'s going to be a little bit hard to succeed. So that\'s one. The second one for me is demanding excellence. Demanding excellence across anything you do. And the third one is passion. Passion for your job. I can talk more about it, but I think when people ask me what do you look for in a candidate? I\'m like, okay, you look for the skills and so on. I\'m going to look for culture fit and passion. And both are going to be equally important. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Excellent. When you were going through these interviews...ABP always be pipelining, like you said, just building that muscle all the time. You\'re the CEO of the hiring process, you own the hiring process. As you\'re going through, and you\'re going through the interviews, what was the calibration exercise like after that? What were the nuts and bolts of that method you use to calibrate with the rest of the team after you were done with the interviews? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yes. So they way it was working is, we do this today at HackerRank, we have something called job guidelines. When we agree what are the skill set that are needed for the job. And we defined the skillset and what we expect from them. And the same way I love to had passion for the company, passion for the job, which I have two different, which are different. And then I had culture, values as part of the scorecard. Okay. What we do is everybody has to...so there no like, oh yeah, I didn\'t have time to update, and I\'m just sending you an email and this thing is going to be okay. No, everybody has to [complete] the scorecard. It is super important. At HackerRank, and depending upon your entry level, if it goes Director and above, actually the entire package goes to our CEO, he wants to review it. And it\'s really, really... Like if you don\'t have the package ready, he\'s not going to approve it. Like he\'s not even going to interview with the person. And if he\'s not part of the interview process, he\'s not gonna approve the package. That person would never get an offer and a reference. So it\'s pretty core. So we have alignment and discussion, a pre-interview process. Not for every interview, but when start a job search. And then what we do, which takes time, but it\'s worth it, when you interview a couple of candidates is that meeting debriefing session. I do believe that often the first two or three candidates you\'re going to bring on sight could be for calibration, calibrating the team. What is happening when you are going that path is you have many new hires, and you\'re going to have to understand their interview style, and what they value, and what they don\'t don\'t value. And I think those post interview meetings, meeting with the team of interviewers and just agreeing and - saying, hey, I he was strong of that, and somebody else saying, no, he was like super weak, and ensuring that everybody\'s on the same page on what we expect, and how we value those skills, is really, really important. So calibration on a couple of first candidates is my take. When you have a more junior team or a new team within the organization. Naber:\xa0 Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Your teams at such hyper growth businesses, those teams are always new, always getting used to the process. Also a smaller business, obviously always getting used to the new process. So as you\'re bringing people on board and you\'re onboarding them, do you have any couple of tactics you use to make sure you bring them onboard and starting to onboard them most effectively? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yes. So actually took me time to find the right onboarding process. Of course you want to put that document together. That\'s what you then have to do. And I think that recently, I finally, found a good way to do it. And what is happening now is on my team when you start, you know on day one, it\'s already on your calendar actually when you start, there is day 30 - you have to present to the entire Marketing team. Naber:\xa0 Very, very cool. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 And what do you have to present? So we provide them a template. I\'m a big template guy. And the template is... What is your job - you\'re familiar with that - in less than 15 words? What did you understand is your job? Less than 15 words. To execute your job, I have something called Relationship 15 - who are the 15 people for you to be successful? We can go deep on that. And list those people. You have five people which are for you to be successful, five for your team, and five for you to grow in your career. Then a stop, start, continue. And people are surprised by it. They\'re like, I just started. I\'m like yeah, but I hired you based on your expertise. If you\'re super junior in your job, I\'m sure you have a point of view on what we should Stop doing, Start doing, Continue doing. Naber:\xa0 And fresh eyes. Fresh eyes. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yes. And give your point of view. And it\'s just to empower people to say, tell me what you think. Like actually, I\'d love to know what you think. And the last one is, what are you gonna achieve at the 60, and what do you plan to achieve at day 90? So this is a forcing function for many, many things to happen before the presentation. Because by doing that, by presenting this to the rest of the..So they presented the entire Marketing organization, to my entire team. And the goal is not like to boo them, and say this and that. That\'s no what it is about. It is about the person to be accountable for what they are going to do. Number two is to understand why they were hired for, and just set a high bar. Like not day one, but it\'s kind of like you\'re going to have to do that. And people realize that that presentation better be good. It just sets the bar for how they\'re going have to deliver and ship moving forward. And three is, for people in the team to understand who they are, and what they\'re going to do, what the new hire is going to do. So it solves a lot of things, and have those meetings & milestone day 30...Wherever I go next, I\'ll repeat that because I\'m happy with it myself. Naber:\xa0 It\'s in the infamous Nicolas Draca playbook. So there\'s so much to pick apart there. Two things I want to you to expand on just a little bit. One is, you talk about, what is your job? I think it\'s from Fred Kaufman\'s Conscious Business - 15 words to define it...That you talk about, and when looking at some of your content you\'ve referenced that in the past. You talk also about how that as an exercise can be a good calibration and way of helping manage up within your job? Can you explain that a little bit? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So what is happening, and it happened to me at the Twilio. I worked with somebody called Francois that I know really, really well. And it took us four months to be on the same page on what my job was. And you might find it silly, it\'s not silly. It\'s just that, you come as a new hire and you have a vision for what you want to do. And when it grows that fast, and it grows at that speed, you\'re going to have to be pretty, pretty clear about what you\'re going to do. And I think you have to be more clear about what you\'re not going to do. It\'s as important. And I think the key to it is being on the same page as your boss on what is your job? And we spend four months with Francois discussing it, where even on my one-on-one, I would bring it on a biweekly basis saying, hey, this is what I\'m going to focus on. And I will get that feedback saying yes, but maybe. And I\'m like, wow, we really have to get to the end of it. And the why of the discussion is pretty simple. One is, let\'s assume you do that. You decide by yourself and what your job is without agreement with your manager, meaning without sign-off and really being on the same page. After 12 months, you\'re going to do a 12 months review, and you\'re going to claim victory! You\'re going to think you\'re going to claim victory. You\'re gonna say, Hey, this is what I did. It is amazing. And the person is going to look at you and say, this is not what I expected from you. And you\'re like, what? I\'ve been working my ass off building that team, shipping A, shipping B, shipping C, delivering here, moving that KPI. And if you replay it in your head, I\'m sure it happens to many people in the past, where the person is looking at you saying, yeah, Nah, that\'s okay, congrats. And so you want to avoid that type of gap or misunderstanding on what you need to solve for. It\'s not only about your personal review, and progression in career, and everything, it\'s just about being sure that you tackle and address things that you were supposed to, in alignment with your boss. Because he or she may have other things to solve for, and they have a bigger vision, they have information you don\'t have, that needs to be to be solved when thinking about the overall strategy - which you could miss a piece. I had another boss at LinkedIn, it was the same like Nick, where I\'m kind of intense, and I move fast, and I love to do things, an so on. And I close on the topic in a meeting, and two weeks later he would come back and say, what about that? And in my head I\'m like, I don\'t understand. We already talked about that. I thought we we closed on it. And then you need to - listening is a big, big thing - pause, listen, and say, okay, it looks like I missed it. And the goal for you is not to push it and just repeat what you need two weeks ago, it\'s more to clarify and say, okay, what is the gap? What is the issue? And what do you expect from me? And you will see that, and I\'ve seen it multiple times...Where people, and I do it the same with my team...If I have something bugging me, I\'m like how can you solve that? And they\'re yeah, of course. And then they don\'t do it. And two weeks after I\'m going to come back to it because I had it top of mind for me. I\'m like, what is the progress on that? And they look at me like, what are you talking about? And so I think driving that alignment, managing up...It\'s more about aligning than managing-up I think, and setting up expectation, is key to success in a collaborative relationship. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Excellent. And one more quick side note on that. You had mentioned, so thinking about managing stakeholders, and we\'ll get to that in a second here. But managing close stakeholders in your close sphere - managing up, managing sideways, and managing down. You talk about this also it has an application to managing sideways and managing your stakeholders, correct? Can you explain that a little bit? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah, yeah. thanks for that, I forgot to mention it. Yeah, good catch. Yeah...So by being clear on what is your job... So first you\'re clear with yourself, which is a good starting point and this is where you want to start. You have managing up, and then again when you\'re in a company growing that fast, everybody has priorities, everybody has work to do. And you want, and I ask my teams do that when engaging on projects, when asking for bandwidth, and time from somebody else on your team or not on your team, you want to explain every time the why. Okay, you want to spend time and say, hey, actually I\'d love for you to spend time with me, or allocate x hours of your time to my initiative. And let me explain the why and impact it\'s going to have. It\'s kind of a Sales pitch internal, it is a sales pitch. And to ensure that that person is going to focus more time with you that they would on another project. And I think explaining clearly the why, and what is your job is part of it, people will appreciate it. And if they disagree, or if they don\'t understand, just pause, put yourself in their shoes, try to understand what they have to solve for, what are the issues they have and why they\'re not getting it, and spend the right amount of time on that. When you build a a big Initiative, large initiative, you want to ensure that people are inspired by the project you\'re trying to lead and push. And I think this will help one, you get successful, two, people understand why they should spend time on it, and three, deliver and ship at scale. Naber:\xa0 Excellent. Thank you for that. Really good tips and insight. And then the last one I want to talk about within Second last thing I wanna talk about within talent. You mentioned the Relationship 15. Can you explain a little bit more about that? You kind of grazed over it, but I do think it\'s important. So the five, five, five, can you explain a little bit more about that? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So, what we do here is we try to get a sense and invite people, I invite people on my team or I do this across the company, also sometimes I did it here at HackerRank...Is can you please list...And I invite everybody to do that. It\'s always an interesting exercise...who are the five people for you to be successful personally, that work in our company. Then who are the five people for your team - and the team can be the team you belong to within Marketing... - to be successful? And who are the five people to help you grow in your career. Okay. And all of these people are mutually exclusive. So they are like 15 different people, right? And afterwards you do a 2x2, everybody loves a 2x2. One is connective tissue - low versus high. And the other one is core versus strategic. And you put the 15 names in that 2x2. It\'s up to you to decide on low versus high and connective tissue. Connective tissue doesn\'t mean that you need to talk to them on a daily basis. Okay, let me be clear. But it means that if you contact them, or you send them an email, they would reply to that email and make time available for you. So when you do that, people came to come to a realization most of the time that they have gaps. The first they are sometimes unclear about who should be those people. They realize that they have gaps. They realize that, hey, actually those 10 people within the company, they don\'t know what my job is, and these are the people you should interact with and explain because they are key to your success. They\'d better know what you\'re solving for. And then as people put together a plan to say specifically, there is a gap on the not in your company for you to grow. And they put together a plan saying, Hey, I need to force myself to go to user groups, to conferences, and make friends, or get to start knowing people and learn from them to be able to grow. Again, it goes back from the assumption...Meaning in my day to day life, when when I work on a project, if it\'s a big initiative, one of the first thing I will do is I will ping between five and 10 of my friends saying, Hey, I\'m thinking about that. That\'s how I would like to do it. What\'s your thought? What\'s your 2 cents? And I can tell you like within a day I get everybody\'s feedback. I listen to feedback. That\'s really important. That\'s another part is just not asking for feedback for the sake of it and process it, package it, and get your idea from V1 to V5 or V10, and learn from it. Naber:\xa0 Nice. Excellent. That\'s great. Okay. let\'s stop into, so we talked about talent, talk about hiring, onboarding, talked a little bit about about developing a dart, developing that talent as well. Understanding them as people where they want to go. from a, from a development perspective, let\'s hop into insights. you\'ve talked about, moving from data to intelligence and you also have talked about smart data versus, not just big data. Explain the insights pillar to your, of your science, of Marketing pillars. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So on the Marketing side today we are, we are lucky because we have more and more data. We have data for everything. There is no lag of a, of metrics. on, on one end we\'re lucky on the other end it\'s overwhelming. and why? Because there\'s too much data and now you can spend your days and just looking at spreadsheets to everybody and a, as far as they know, you don\'t need a business by just looking at spreadsheet. All right? 12 hours a day. So here are the eight year is first based on your priorities and everything. I come from the science of Marketing. it\'s to be able to, and dishpan how are you going to measure success early on? and maybe the first time you do it, you don\'t have the right number. But I invite everybody to try it. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 And they\'re, I\'m pick a number. and maybe their first quarter is to test your capacity to deliver up to that number, but what you wanted a success as to being controlled and then descend the dynamic of how you\'re going to get there. And w w when you are able to do that, the first time, then you\'d be able, you\'re going to be able to build on it and become, become better. But I believe for that, for whatever you do in general, there is a measure of success that you can apply. and you should apply that measure of success, learn from it. My framework all the time is I have a high KPI and then I have free metrics reporting that KPI. I know I\'m saying conceptual than meaning is there so many, as I mentioned, you could apply and when you have these under control and when this is working and you are able to predict, okay. Plus minus 10% what you\'re doing, it\'s to move to the next level. And being able to leverage meaning machine learning, data science, depending on the, on the team you have, if you have good Ascentis working for you to be a model is a big drewhich is to predict capacity of people to buy or to predict something unless at the time predict capacity of a customer too to buy your product. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Excellent. And when someone has very little data or limited data, what\'s the mindset that they should have as they\'re getting started doing that? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah, so I think they are. so I don\'t, so first most of the time of people I have the data,and why? Because you have historical data and so the feedback everybody\'s gonna share is oh yeah, but they stopped. I\'m yeah, okay. But it\'s still really, that\'s it. And so every time I build something, I\'m going to go like hardcore Demand gen here. You\'re okay, well many SQL Sales qualified qualifying today, deliver next quarter. And I invite people, I\'m like back and they\'re it\'s sex. I\'m yeah, I got that part. Look back, it doesn\'t matter. And try to make a guess about how many and then try to define a target for yourself and you show you the next quarter and how many you want to deliver and you will, you will learn. So that\'s one. because looking at historical data, you always add something to learn. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 There is no perfect data and nobody, no marketer will tell you like you have the best data in the world. So, you just have to put your ego aside and just process of past data to try to understand what\'s going on. Or you can look at benchmark. of course, they are, there is no lack of website with benchmark data. I think as a core, you should look at historical data. And my guiding principle here is you just want to become better quarter of a quarter, right? If your number was 50, the way you want it to become 60, like something higher and let\'s these 10%, that\'s how I look at it. And you need to take into consideration the cycle that it wouldn\'t take you like three to six months, which is okay to understand it and to be able to grow it. Success all the time is being in control. Agasomething I learned in many companies is you can miss something like the word assist mess and not being in control and not understanding the why. If you\'re in control, it\'s a great starting point for you to become better at what you do. Naber:\xa0 Nice. I love that. That\'s great quote. You can put that on a, put that on a license plate, put that on a, on a tattoo, something like that. So two more pieces I want to talk about with an insights. one is, I mean, I don\'t know if people know this about you. You have six U s patents. I mean that\'s, that\'s ridiculous. So one of those patents that comes from the use of data insights and moving back against an account based Marketing model, yeah, you\'ve gone from a data to intelligence and applied that to how can I impact revenue as much as possible. Can you talk a little bit about, your account based Marketing thought process structure, the mindset? yeah, but let\'s start there. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yes. So on the ABM you want me to talk about the patents, like what we did, how did we get there? Okay. so what we do, I go back to the talent buckets that we ensure that we spend 20% of our time experimenting, always. and why is because we live in a world where things are changing fast. and whatever you did and whatever failed six months ago doesn\'t mean it\'s going to fail today. So we, we build a culture, all empowerment where you can succeed or fail. And actually if you fail, it\'s okay. As long as you know why? that\'s why we go back to, yeah. You need to know why you need to be in control. And so by doing that, there are some experiments that are going to fail and and died and some other that are going to be highly successful. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 And here we were working with a teon the Sales op side, data science side and business insights. Okay. We\'d love to predict propensity of an account to buy. And what we did initially, we started on a a on a Friday putting on a whiteboard. Like how would we score an account? And and today everybody in Sales and Marketing you the framework, your called decision, a demon waterfall. And that demon wonderful framework as a little bit of an issue is there\'s not yet you move from it lead a contact I mentioned to an account I mentioned. So more or less he does not really connect because in a perfect 12 you want to do a funnel, which is a full account funnel from Marketing qualified accounts. That\'s where the new concept of the time up to your SQL and close one business. So looking at this, we\'re okay, we need to identify, defined something called working quantified accounts. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 I think we called it ais. I count into our score. Initially the idea was to say, okay, let\'s look at all the contacts associated to the account, their level of engagement, and do kind of a weighted nps average on how, the account score should be. I\'m geeking out a little bit, but as you can see, it started more with a brainstorming with somebody on my team called fat and saying, Hey, how should we think about that? And then explaining the why as a vision, partnering with Sales operation, partnering with a data fence theme and some of the tewe assembled this team saying, okay, this looks pretty cool. let\'s put some science behind it. what we did is what started an experiment, ended up being a success because it was one of the dimensioned core to how we will plan into account or location or account follow up. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 moving forward, at LinkedIn and with all the support of the company. We went through the patent process and after I think, I\'m sure, you also when on the product side, where people looked at it and maybe integrated it in their algorithm. I\'m not sure about that. I don\'t know what they did with it, but, that it was a great story. There\'s a, an experiment on a Friday afternoon discussion culture of hey, let\'s push it to the next level, see if it works. Partnering with people who could operation and being able to put it together. Naber:\xa0 Yeah, the common, yeah, that\'s what I was thinking. The combination of collaboration, cross stakeholder management, cross stakeholder partnerships and projects that you had to work on in order to get that done. Plus it\'s the vision that you had in order to get that done. It was, it was really impressive. so, one more, one more thing I want to talk about around data. Let\'s pull it up a level and we\'re going to talk about stakeholder relationships for a minute. you talk about, measuring from a Marketing perspective and aligning with stakeholders within the business. most specifically you\'ve talked about aligning with finance and aligning with Sales. Can you talk a little bit about the process you go through taking data, taking information, and at the same time going to align with the way that you believe and they believe Marketing should be measured within the company because it sounds like you\'ve got, an excellent methodology that I believe a lot of people would really benefit from. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So I want him to another panel recently we talk about the same. So what\'s happening? What is, what is the, because there was an issue today, the issue today is sometime the issue is misalignment. Wow. Looks like simple issue, but it\'s a pretty complex one. and what is the issue in my point of view is Sales as a point of view on what an SQL, if you dig ESCO as a measure of success should be Marketing at the point of view and people don\'t align.okay. And so the way I\'ve done it [inaudible] I come with a set of like two or three definitions. Okay. And I go and talk to finance to, to Sales. And I\'m Hey, this is a freeways, we can do it a n. And really my positioning is pick one. I don\'t care. because the deficient or like it\'s more in the details. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 It\'s not really in the definition itself. It\'s like it\'s a detail. And I think an open discussion and explaining against the why saying, Hey, this is option a and this is what\'s going to happen. This is option B, this is option c, what do you feel good about? And often actually those discussion people are oh, thank I appreciate it first to have a discussion. I appreciate the explanation of all of it. And quite often actually people come back saying, okay, you pick, I agree with, I understand where you come from, I understand what you\'re trying to achieve. And let\'s agree on it. And and so quite quick, quite often actually people come back, say you pick, if they decide,I\'m fine with it, but what are we going to do is, we\'d gone and we\'re gonna spend the amount of time needed to get to that agreement. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 it\'s not the loosey Goosey suggest hey, we had a discussion. Oh, I\'m running out, I need you to come to a call, a meeting. I\'m yeah, we\'re going to meet after agalike just to be the, I want to hear you say it. I agree with and you\'re going to say the definition and then we\'ll be done. Right. and then really, and it\'s not that you\'re later. So we get to that and then what are we going to do? on top of it is I think as the, our Sales development, depending on representative team or BDR, depending on the teeverybody has different names, but you want to co own, and this is when I was doing a, I\'ve LinkedIn is what I was doing a Trulia, here\'s what my team is doing. A HackerRank that number was, was that team and be golden. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 The same number. Okay. Yup. And and this is just going to move from definition to execution where, and being able to do it on the operational side. It is, there is no disconnect. People present together. They the same view on the number and phone and stuff. And you would see it goes back to that alignment, that alignment and collaboration again. I know like just the theme I and again agreeing in your disagreement nation on the same page, to be able to push it and to move forward. Like I don\'t think if you work in an organization I was sharing, it\'s where Sales and Marketing or are not like partnering together every single stage, not only at teaching level, you have the CMO and the cro like smiling and saying, of course we know each other up to the board level and down to the lower level in the organization. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 It needs to be across the board. It doesn\'t have to be a exact only because, because this, this is, this would not work. And I had something else I wanted to add and that\'s level. Yeah. Once I have, I have, I have a good anecdote. I have, somebody called Dan. one of the company I worked at, they told LinkedIn and once I was struggling withwell I would not align with my str clinical quintuple and he looked at me and I\'m Hey, I\'m struggling here. It wasn\'t a big deal. Right. But we were just we were doing planning for the year and we\'re just not moving forward in one sentence. The he fixed it is Hey N***a, Naber:\xa0 okay, Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 if you guys are not able to align, [inaudible] means that we may have hired the wrong people. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 and in my head, I froze and I\'m yeah, we, we, we, we, we, we\'d be aligned by end of week. Naber:\xa0 It\'s going to be okay. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Sandy twice. to be frank, it was me and Jeff Naber:\xa0 [inaudible]. Right, right. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 The last name I just get first name. But it was, and we were not struggling in our relationship. Like it wasn\'t like it wasn\'t a great relationship, but it was just as the detail of the planning. It\'s yeah, we do not hire the right people. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 In my mind, it was like 10 years ago, I think. And I\'m yeah, got it. Naber:\xa0 Well those details matter and that Dan is a very smart Dan. so when we\'re taking a look at these different pillars, what I want to do is, let\'s jump into Twilio. You\'re jumped to Twilio. What\'s you\'re responsible for, at Twilio. You making that jump and then jump into HackerRank as well, and talk about how you jumped in and what you\'re doing right now. And then I\'ve got one or two more topics and then we\'ll, and then we\'ll break. Yeah. So Twilio there was a little bit of, another muscle to build here. It was on the growth angle and a business to developer Marketing to developer. agagrateful product, great team internally, very pretty product. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 And here the play was to adapt. And the challenge I was excited about is to be able to learn how to market to a new persona, being developer, knowing that one, so you don\'t like a marketer and they don\'t like Salespeople. so it was, that\'s kind of a challenge when you start. and, and how to be successful at driving engagement and building trust, with that audience to grow the business. Naber:\xa0 Got It. what did you learn about going through that process when you were at Twilio and what were you guys particularly good at? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 So I first starting from the CEO, the relationship was a w meetings. The CEO was a developer first. cool type of c a product to but like hard core developer. And so, the first one was how to keep and maintain a developer law brand. You have to constantly, like in developer, well do you have developer love and developer? so being a developer love brit\'s all about trust, and, and great product of course, and documentation and psalm. But there is a muscle, tied to it. And the other one of the big learning is the concept of a listening. Meaningless. Listening is a, is a big, big thing. And listening and understanding how that persona, communicate and there is a lot of lessening because there is a lot of learning. so I graduated from computer science. I\'m not going to claim to be a developer anymore, but understanding and little bits of persona. But here it was a lot of like nobody really had a playbook about how to like AWS add one. There was the only one but how to successfully build that motion and it was a ton of listening and learning and experiment actually listening learnings and experiment. Naber:\xa0 Oh very cool. road you must have gone on in order to get there. So from a, now the last, the next two pillars reason I want to jump into Twilio\'s cause operations in life cycle. I\'m sure that you had to iterate on your playbook as you\'re thinking about the operations and life cycle, jumping into that development persona or developer persona and persona, you were, you were a Marketing too. Can you talk a little bit about operations in lifecycle pillar and also some of the best practices one should think about as they\'re going through executing those two things? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yes, of course. And you\'re going to see, my answer is going to be pretty fruit. Hopefully it will be on point. so as a core, Marketing is about orchestrating customer life cycle. Okay. What does this mean? It means that you need to be able to execute on the right persona, right time, right offer, right channel. It seems super simple actually. It\'s highly complex, right? And as part of that framework, and if your approach was that frame within that framework, you can not be wrong. And there are two things you want to do. One is customer centricity just puts a customer as a center of it and you want to be relevant. If you\'re not sure how that event in those four dimensions, you\'re just going to be unsuccessful. Sure. Okay. So when you think about operations and orchestration, lifecycle and so on, is when I playing that framework, if you put the customer at the center of it and you\'re relevant and you\'re able to understand right persona. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 So who\'s your buyer? So you have a set of persona and defining them and understanding what they care about. right. channel is what channel do they use? How do they engage with you? Right? Time as ours, they\'re a suspect, meaning they have no clue who you are. Prospects such as they have an idea, but what you offer our costumers, which hopefully they know they\'d be more, right offer is what type of content they need or they care about. Right? Is it a customer story? Is it some data sheets of white papers, some demo, some video and so on and so on. So just spending\'s a time to operate within that framework, agaand putting the customer as a center of it is what\'s going to set you up for success. Naber:\xa0 Cool. And I know this is, that\'s a great answer and I love the framework. If I\'m going from, I know it\'s going to depend on the place where I\'m starting from, but if I\'m going to move to the model you just talked about, around right content, right person, right time, right channel. If I\'m gonna, if I\'m going to go through and execute against that framework, how long should I expect it to take me as a market, new organization? as I go through an iterate on this, how long should I expect to take to me for me to get it right? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So I think as usual is because it is so complex, you just want to start, learn and become better, right? So I think the, the first step, for example, if you go step one is okay, I have three type of buyers, whether they are type A, B, and c, and it\'s trying to be able to bucket them in those and to tag them in your CRM saying, okay, so this is type A\'s, this is type bs, this is type two. It doesn\'t need more complexity than that. Right? and it started there. That\'s step one. And being able to, go in details and say our buyer persona framework available on the web as much as you want and start ensuring that the way you communicate to buyer a, B, or c a is different, in your wording and your messaging and what you deliver to them, right? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 For example, if you have a highly technical buyer, you going to be really careful and really thoughtful when, on your messaging and those type of profile. I appreciate more of a nonhuman type of interaction. Yeah. Okay. So only one to empower your Sales development team to go crazy and say good and last then because what\'s going to happen as in subscribes, whether it be for the roof and they just gonna hate your brright? And if, if, let\'s assume you find a way to engage with them, you want to ensure that the, the, the Sales team is highly technical or has been trained to have at least a first like five minutes of discussion is a buyers technical again to, to out that, that, that lingo and ends that engagement, right? Because the center approach is as just not gonna work. And I think it\'s the same applied to every single persona. So to summarize, I think success will come quickly for your messaging, looking at your engagement rate and if people engaging with if they\'re not engaging with it\'s just means you\'re doing it the wrong way. But keep it simple and start don\'t, don\'t wait. And don\'t overthink it. Focus on your persona and your messaging. And this will solve, I think for many, many things to get started and just improve it. Naber:\xa0 Okay, great. Thank you. Hey, one more topic I want to cover. So let\'s jump into HackerRank. You joining HackerRank, what you\'re doing, and then I\'ve got one more topic and then we\'ll wrap. Okay. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah. So HackerRank so I joined two years ago, two over there to one, build a team again. startup was a series B. It was 120 on police when I started. So it\'s, to put a team together to execute on a, on a Marketing practice and then to focus really on meaning a couple of things. One, the brand and end the value prop. Also positioning messaging, was a big topic. enablement. we have Salespeople across the globe. was it be topic as well? thought leadership. of course, our current, today\'s a leader in skill assessment for developer and felt leadership. Like we, we believe we own the discussion, on that topic where as the expert and being sure that we can execute on thought leadership across multiple dimensions. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Excellent. and thank you for a small overview of HackerRank as well. it\'s such a cool brand and excellent product. when last topic I want to talk about is, is that transition, into, let\'s call it an early stage or mid stage business at the COO level, how does your mind need to develop and how does your thought process need to develop as you\'re getting into that mid stage Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 COO mindset, what should your mindset be as you\'re coming into the organization? What should your first few steps be and what sort of frameworks that you think to apply as you\'re, talking to other c levels and starting to execute with your team? Yeah, so the a, when you start, I think, all the ways is you don\'t know what you don\'t know. Another, a stupid statement, but it\'s, spending another half time. I think it\'s a step one. And I was discussing with friends, in the same jobs as do, as many customer meeting as you can, in there for 30 days. So whatever I talked about prior in the 30 days, I apply it to myself, as well. but, but it\'s it starts with hearing the voice of their customer and it\'s not to go on those customer meetings to please the Sales organizations saying, Hey, I\'m on the Marketing side. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 I did it. Check, let\'s move on. That\'s not what it is about is trying to get a sense of, how are you learn so much, right? What do customers care about? the lingo? Like what word do they use? What it is, their perception of our brand? What is the type of issue they\'re trying to solve? So use case and what does it mean on, on, on their end. so does this is one that I\'d spend time with, different size, SMB and Marketing depending on your business, but try to tackle all the segments. Yup. And from a prospect standpoint and a customer stand point, because of course a discussion are going to be different, you\'re learning are going to be different. Number two is, I do deep dive was all the exact meaning my stakeholders saying, hey, we gonna meet a year from now. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 What is success like you\'re gonna tell me you gotta you good job because of work and what do you expect? And everybody has a different expectation. So you just want to go around and get a sense from everybody about what they expect. And then step three is just putting a plan together. I tend to define priorities pretty quickly saying, hey, so those are my priorities. This based on my playbook of course. But, and of course I\'m at like six months or more, like two years, and get a team and makes the effort saying, okay, I\'m going to take all of your teputs them together in a room for 45 minutes, send the preread and I\'m going to explain to you what I think I should do and what I\'m going to focus on. And so over communicating on that. Okay. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 and go there getting feedback and that just a pan. And what I will do, on my first one oh one wasmy boss in that case, a CEO, I\'ll use my priorities as a framework to lead for as an agenda for, for a, our one on no, and just builds that muscles things. This is what I\'m focusing on this way and it\'s works meaning it, it\'s just because he\'s oh yeah, where are you doing on time? When are you doing on the life cycle? What are you doing in go to market? and it\'s just to connect the dots between is what he has in his head and what he\'s expecting from me. Naber:\xa0 Nice. That\'s great. that\'s actually a really good transition to my last question about it. how do you get people to, how do you get, other stakeholders, whether it\'s Sila, whether it\'s up, sideways, down, maybe even board level, et cetera. what\'s the exercise you go through, some of the tactics you use in order to get people on the same page about what Marketing is, what their job is and how you define it versus how they define it. What are those types of conversations? Are some tactics you use to get on the same page? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Yeah, so we have, so we have like any other, a team like QBO, ours, so if you don\'t have QBR, so even if it\'s, yeah, so I was discussing recently was a smaller company actually not so small and they\'re oh, we don\'t have QBR yours. And I\'m what? so, we, we have, so if you don\'t have cube, yours was your exec teput qprs together. and so this is, this is what I use. for those, for those who don\'t know, quarterly business reviews can explain a little bit, maybe 30 seconds, explain about the quarterly business reviews. So quarterly business reviews is as kind of a, one thing as you\'re going to look back. So you\'re hey, I had five priorities and this is how I deliver against my priority, and what my team has done and look forward saying, hey, is this is what I\'m going to focus on on the next quarter? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 It was a session for the look back. He\'s more hey, this is what happened and the look forward is this is what I plan to do. Is it the line was what you guys spent? Yeah, I\'m super religious about those. and what I mean by that is I\'m not going to do zen at 7:00 AM for a meeting at 8:00 AM. I\'m going to spend time with my team. I\'m going to spend time with myself prepping for that and being, like demeaning acceptance of myself as aquatic Cimzia QBR because it ties back to the quality of the work, that, that we going to do. And I\'m going to spend time if needed. And if there are some complex topic, I\'m going to pre wire it was my stakeholders and if we have a team meeting, at the each end level, I would not be shy of doing even those half an hour meeting of Hey, is, this is what I\'m thinking about? What do you think? I\'m happy to do five, 10 of those meetings if needed, but I want to ensure that there was no gap. And if your communication, what I selfishly, work on and when agreed and when I get a little bit of feedback after moving to after it\'s okay, see you in three months, more or less and w moving fast. I think by, by working on, like if you don\'t know where you\'re going, you don\'t know where you\'re going. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 Agaanother stupid statement, but at for one. And so it means you don\'t have a pass do anything. and so we try to be pretty clear at all level in the Marketing organization about what is success three months from now and that\'s what we should for by doing zap. It helped us understand what we are not going to work on and number two is have an impact. And I think with time, if you have this type a little bit of a vision of what you want to do and issue, you know where you\'re going. except if you are wrong on your destination, that\'s a different story. But if you are right, you will drive impact, which would drive respect and trust, was in your organization. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Okay. Excellent. You\'ve been so great with your time. Amazing. Thank you so much. I\'ve got two rapid fire questions. It won\'t take very long and we\'re gonna wrap. first one I asked to some people\'s birthdays. It\'s not your birthday. We said, well, if it is, there\'ll be really bad of me not to know that. But it\'s, I don\'t think it\'s your birthday. but I\'m going to ask you anyways, I explained all this to my audience are sick of hearing me say that, but I really like to ask to some people\'s birthdays. what is the most important, learning or lesson you\'ve acquired professionally in the last 12 months? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 What is and what have I learned? The, work, it\'s a, enjoy. I\'m still, it\'s both a personal and professional is, enjoying the moment. I\'m not there yet. and what, I mean, why, why you personally, it kind of makes sense. Why would it make sense? Professionally? It\'s because we keep running like crazy doing a loan and a lot of things. and we don\'t spend enough time appreciating either what we\'re doing or what we\'ve done and I\'m still learning process in mind for another 18 months. It will, it will take me another, I\'ve set up a goal on it. I think it\'s will take more time to be at the level that I\'d love to be. I\'d love to understand. Naber:\xa0 Yeah, that\'s such a hard one. if you\'ve got any tactics that you\'ve found are very helpful share, but otherwise, the next 18 months, maybe we should revisit the session and we can talk only about that topic if there\'s a framework, Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 having that peace of mind. I don\'t know. That\'s why I\'m not there, but I\'ll find it. Naber:\xa0 Okay, fair enough. let\'s see. Last, last question is, when you\'re looking to hire, executives within a business, what are, what are a couple, like maybe your, maybe your, well, let me rephrase the question. Let\'s say you\'re at a smaller mid size business uh, Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 you\'re hiring your first a couple of leadership hires. What are some things that your no, you need to hire for in those first couple of leadership hires in order to nail it? Yeah, I think the, so when you, you tend to learn, it\'s a great question. so I think you learn through the process when the person, I\'m going to go, when the person started, like you\'re gonna learn often that if it is your first, executive team hire, you\'re going to learn a year later what you expected. and which is a little bit of an issue. So what you want to do is, I\'m going to talk about the Marketing function, and I think apply to other function. I meet with a ton of CEO and they\'re I\'m going to hire my first marking. how should I look? And I\'m Hey, it\'s easy. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 what is I go back, what is success, a year or two years from now? Like you need to be really, really clear about what, what is success and not success, like super tactical success. Like what are the three things you want that person to solve? Because I think from that, it will drives a skillset to you. You need and you will have a better send and prioritizing, like [inaudible] kings zos. because what ended up happening sometimes is you\'re looking for a Unicorn and Unicorn don\'t exist as far as I know. and so being clear in your head about what you\'re looking for and stack ranking, who will help you define the skills, that you did and if that\'s just from the skills number two is a compromise. A culture. Like if you don\'t hire somebody, like if you have a doubt by the way on culture fit, just go no, like we used to do it anymore because you\'re next candidate. Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 I know executive hires hard and takes time, but I\'ve never seen somebody compromising on culture and hiring somebody and the thing to work it every time it\'s getting worse actually. because yeah, like you have the unconscious voice in your head and number free. That\'s I think something that people are shy about doing that. Ask people to present a plan. Even at executive level, Hey, guess what? Love loves the discussion. come and present a plan to the team. And sometimes I\'ve seen it where people are shy about that. Butyou say executive, I\'m no, screw that. Right. we want to understand how he thinks and I think this tells a lot, about how like their mindset or they think and how their, their view of it a business. nice. And how prescriptive are you with the plan that you asked them to present? Nicolas Draca:\xa0\xa0 You templated about it or did you just kind of let them run with whatever the plan is now it\'sno template. There\'s like winning that level. The guy you should be able to articulate something you don\'t know like from the session. oh, people, lesson manage time. how does each thing, what do they value religious talk about theirselves do they would do like or if you have a plan, I\'m going to go back to Thailand as a guy and they were talking about these telike what, what happened you miss that. Like I add a Sales plan. I\'ve seen a Sales exec presenting and they never talk about the customer. And so every time I weighed like 40 minutes and I\'mwhat about meeting was costumer? Oh yeah, yeah. That\'s why I\'m dude, what are you talking about? so I think it\'s a, when it gets Heidi tactical, but I think it tells you if if you manage it the right way and you know you\'re because sometimes people have a tendency to say, I\'m going to do email. It\'s hey, email. Decide. You just listen and use two hours to go really deep. you will understand that. Naber:\xa0 Hey everybody, thanks so much for listening.

He was there for pre-IPO startup stage to the acquisition by Microsoft. Here we go.! Naber:\xa0 DSG! Awesome to have you on the show, man. Thank you so much for taking the time to come hang out with me for a little while. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Naber, always a pleasure. Looking forward to the conversation. Naber:\xa0 Cheers, buddy. You\'re coming from London today, is that correct? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That is correct, yeah, based out of the WeWork on Chauncery Lane. Naber:\xa0 Chauncery Lane - write it down, everybody. Put it on your Google Map. Naber:\xa0 it\'s hard to know with you. You are, you\'re everywhere. You are all over the place. When I\'m looking at your Instagram or any of your social feeds, you\'re everywhere. So we\'ll talk about that in a little bit here. What I want to do is go into a little bit of your background, probably personally first, and then we\'ll jump into professional, and then we\'ll hop into some of your super powers and some of the things you\'ve observed as well as lived and executed over multiple businesses and multiple roles. I think people really lucky to hear from you today, which is great. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Awesome. Naber:\xa0 Why don\'t we start with you growing up a little bit personally. So I know that you\'ve been mostly London through and through, which is a bit ironic considering how much you are all over the world for snowboarding, traveling with family, traveling with the partner, traveling by yourself, traveling with friends, and with all the global businesses and roles you\'ve had. It\'s pretty amazing that you\'ve been almost always in London. Give us maybe five minutes or so on DSG, Daniel Sanchez-Grant was growing up, and what your childhood was like. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sure. So, I guess come from an entrepreneurial background. My mum was very successful business woman. She setup a company in the recruitment industry, and went to build that during a time where recruitment, and particularly the agency market in the UK was a really successful industry. And so I grew up in an environment where a high work ethic, a successful achieving kind of environment. Two older sisters, who in their own right very successful individuals, doing different careers. And so grew up in-and-around London, actually from a place called Staines. It\'s probably most famous for Ali G, of all things. Naber:\xa0 A-mazing, a-mazing. Nothing could come out of your mouth that would make you more proud than that. He\'s unbelievable, unbelievable. He\'s an amazing set of characters, and he\'s an absolute genius for what he\'s been able to do. And the people he\'s able to get on this show - what\'s the email look like, or the message look like, that comes to get that level of success rate and conversion rate for getting those people in your show? It\'s unbelievable. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. He\'s he\'s definitely become synonymous with the place that I grew up, so, that\'s quite funny. But, so look, spent a bunch of time there. Left school, relatively young, and joined the family business and spent four years in that business. joined with the idea of being there for a couple of weeks to help out during the summer, and fell in love with the whole environment. And four years later was still there and going strong. And so I think that was a huge part of shaping my professional perspective, and work ethic, and just loved being in a entrepreneurial environment and building companies. And so yeah, that was a lot of fun. Naber:\xa0 And what were your set of responsibilities in that business? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think, to be honest, there wasn\'t anything, there wasn\'t...when you\'re building a company of that stage, when I joined it was four people in a branch environment in a place called Teddington. So, you don\'t really have a set of responsibilities, right? whether it\'s fixing the printer, or going and covering a temporary assignment on reception for one of your clients. The role was so varied from that point of view and therefore it just gives you a flavor of all aspects of business - from payroll, to customer service, to candidate management, business development. From that point of view, it was super fun. So in the early favor I was 17, totally clueless, probably more of a hindrance than a help to a lot of the talented people I worked with during my time. But, I got exposure to different ways of working. And that was just a small group, but such a talented, diverse group within that environment. Such different styles amongst the three or four consultants that we started with that, as an early career professional, just really inspiring and energizing exposure at a young age. So, how to run a business, how to service as costumers, how to think about building teams and a great culture. It was a lot of fun. So yeah, that was the early parts of my four years there. And I look back with nothing but fond memories of that experience. And I think also, it being a family thing, I think it brings a different level of purpose to the feeling that you get from building stuff and accomplishing things on a day-to-day basis. I think that\'s hard to replicate in other types of environments. Naber:\xa0 Yup. And that was LPR, correct? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, it was a Litchfield\'s Personnel and Recruitment, it was called. It started in Teddington, and then grew to be multiple branches, and 20 to 30 full time staff at one point, and hundreds of people working on a temporary basis. So yeah, that was a fun ride. Naber:\xa0 And you went through the roles and ranks to General Manager that business, is that correct? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. My mum, at the time, got to the point where she\'d stepped back from the business. It was doing really well and had gone into an early retirement, and me and a bunch of people were running and different branches, different customers at that time. And so yeah, it was exciting...Got to a point where I was fairly integral into the running of that company, and obviously at 20, 21 years old, that\'s a lot of really good experiences quite early into how to drive a company, how to make sure that people are happy, and all of that good stuff. Naber:\xa0 I want to go off the script from some of these tech businesses that you\'ve worked for, to talk about this just for a minute. So as a young professional...there\'s a lot of young managers in tech companies and a lot of young leaders in tech companies because, oftentimes, they\'ll promote internally, or for a lot of reasons. Sometimes that\'s just what they\'ve always done. Sometimes it\'s because of speed. Sometimes it\'s because they have brilliant people, and they\'re just the best people for that role. But there\'s a lot of young leaders and young managers. For someone that is a young manager, a young leader, that is either managing or leading people that are older than them, or more experienced than them - that sounds something you had to do when you\'re relatively young. Is there any sort of mindset, or way that you think about, or set of advice that you\'ve given to other people that are in the same scenario so that they can alleviate confidence concerns or not overthink it? Any advice or mindset that you can deliver to folks that are in that same scenario? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, so I think the first thing is that it\'s totally okay not to have all the answers, right? If I think about all of the teams that I have and have managed, the best teams, I\'m surrounded by people even today who are much better than me at a whole bunch of things, and I love that. And so I think, just firstly, acknowledging that you\'re always going to be running teams where there\'s people who have a different point of view, more experience, a better skillset. And I think it\'s really about embracing that and not being afraid of it. And so, I guess that first thing is like, that\'s okay, and think about what it is that you do really well and play to those strengths. And then think about what, how do you harness the skills of others around you to make sure that you\'re benefiting from that collective experience. So yeah, I\'d say that would be one of the core things for me. And also just embracing the fact that you\'re always, if you\'re going to build great teams, you\'re going to be surrounded by people that all the time. And that\'s something to be excited about, not afraid of. Naber:\xa0 Yeah, good point. I mean, you\'re just constantly working with inspiring people that you\'d love to learn from - on the left of you and on the right of you - that\'s a really good thing to keep in mind. Especially the fastest growing businesses in the world, the people working at those businesses the people listening on this podcast, people that aspire to go to those businesses. It\'s just going to continue to happen. It\'s not slowing down, no matter how old or experienced you get. You\'re exactly right. That makes sense. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Totally. And I also think just because someone\'s on your team, be vulnerable, right? If there\'s something that they do really, really well, it doesn\'t mean you can\'t go and talk to them about how they do it and what they\'ve done to improve that skill. And showing that interest, and recognizing what someone is really strong at, then using that as a conversation to help me improve on this thing, I think can be a really great experience when you\'re managing people, and definitely brings those two individuals having that type of engagement much closer together. Naber:\xa0 Yeah, totally. I\'ve got a bunch of things I wanted to get to, so we can get into CEB, but one more question on that. Is there any way that you found that you\'ve been able to facilitate one person learning really well from another, either as they come onboard into the organization, or so that your team is learning from each other, or teams that you\'re managing are learning from other teams you\'re not managing. Is there any way you found to be able to facilitate that, or processes you\'ve been able to put in place in order to make sure happens? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, sure. So I guess, if you think about InVision at the moment, we\'re growing really fast, right? So in the last two years in our international business, we\'ve added 60 people across a whole range of different roles and levels as we\'ve grown. That\'s a really exciting environment to be in when you\'re bringing on great people. And then you try to think about how, particularly in a fully distributed, remote environment - how do you ensure every individual that starts that they\'re setup for success. And so, we\'ve learned a whole bunch of things over the last two years, definitely made some mistakes on that journey, but one of the things that we\'ve really focused on is that onboarding experience. What are the steps in a remote environment that are required for someone to get up to speed in their role as quickly as possible? What are the tools they need? What are the skills and knowledge that we need to be able to provide them with? How do we, in this distributed, unique environment, how do, we get that to them as quickly as possible. And so, we spent a whole bunch of time talking to people that had gone through the process, and we built a fairly comprehensive 30-60-90 day checklist - where we detail out in week one, here\'s all the people that you need to speak to. Here are your buddies across different functions. Here are the tools that you need to embrace. And really tried to create a framework, so that in that first 90 days there\'s real transparency around the people that you need to have relationships with, the tools, and then the processes. And we found with a tool like that, where the manager and whomever it is that is joining are working through it in a fairly systematic way, we can just ensure that people have connections in to the things that can help them be successful in their role. Naber:\xa0 And obviously we\'re tweaking and changing this all the time because the business is just so rapidly changing. But that\'s probably been one way - create transparency around the leading indicators that are going to make someone successful, and then the relationships that people need within that. So that would be one example. Then I\'d say one other example - how do you drive collaboration amongst a remote team? Just because we\'re remote doesn\'t mean that we don\'t care about things culture, and learning, and self improvement, and development. So we\'re really heavily invested in ways in which we can continuously bring the teams together, not just remotely, but in person, and what do those engagements look, and how do we orientate those agendas around specific things going on in the business that are going to enable these people to be more successful. So it\'s an ongoing process, but fascinating to do it in an organization that one, is so rapidly growing, but two, doing it, in a fully distributed and remote all over the world. Naber:\xa0 Yeah, it\'s unbelievable. I mean, you guys are the largest distributed remote workforce on the planet - at least for fast growing tech businesses, if not for almost everybody. It\'s pretty unbelievable what you guys have been able to build. I love the gold that just came out of your mouth for the prescriptive-ness or the prescript-ivity, if you will. I don\'t even know if that\'s a word, but I made it up. But the prescriptiveness, that you get down to the details on the first 30 days, first week, you know, who to talk to, conversations to be having, relationships to be having, tools, process, etc. I think that\'s great for a lot of people to hear, especially those listening on these conversations, because, I think too many people overlook the onboarding experience as an opportunity to not just check boxes and get them access to tools, and email, and hardware, and maybe a buddy here, or a conversation, or a mentor there. It just got to be extremely prescriptive, especially in remote or decentralize environments, like tech businesses are always in. And I think that gold just came out of your mouth is really valuable for all these tech businesses that are out there. It\'s great. Thanks so much DSG. Let\'s move on to CEB. So you went from, you went from LPR to CEB. Tell us about that jump and tell us about what you\'re up to there. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, sure. So, CEB was actually SHL at the time, which were a talent management, technology services provider. They specialized in psychometric assessments. So, ability tests, metric tests, and they were actually one of my customers at LPR at the time. And so we were recruiting for salespeople, who, interestingly had a psychology background. This was an organization that was a leading...a market leader in occupational psychology, and how to really get the best of your talent across the entire lifecycle of an employee. I was really fascinated by them at the time because I\'d spent four years in this recruitment market place trying to find companies, just great people at great companies. And what SHL really specialized in is how do you bring science to that process, and give companies the tools that enable you to identify behavioral traits, and preferences, and strengths and weaknesses. And as I got to know them as a customer, I was at this interesting crossroads in my career where I\'ve been working with the family business for four years. I was 17 when I started, four years later, do I want to be running this forever? Or are other things that I need to go and do to test myself, expand my skills. As you can imagine, my mom is still one of my closest friends and mentors, but tough conversations have with someone who I can imagine on a selfish level, it\'s like, "I don\'t want you to go". But then obviously as her son was super supportive in me progressing and exploring my career. And so joined SHL in an inside sales role and progressed fairly quickly into Enterprise, field-based sales for them working with large, FTSE 100 companies and helping them with things leadership development, and employee development, talent management, recruitment and how they used assessments and services as part of that mix. Really great experience, and one thing I really took from there is value-based selling. How to really orientate your conversation around the customer and the challenges that they face, and how to build more solution orientated-type agreements. So yeah, it was an awesome experience with some really good people that I\'m still in touch with today. And yeah, it was a super tough decision to leave that to be honest. Naber:\xa0 Yeah, I bet. SHL is an awesome business, and becoming part of CEB made them even stronger as well. You have so many good experiences it sounds within that particular role, when you move to LinkedIn, tell us about that jump. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, it was interesting. So I was, let\'s see, at Wembley Football Stadium for an event that I think an applicant tracking system provider was running. I was there in an SHL capacity with clients. Great day. I was actually sent there as a development opportunity, and I just remember the overall content of the speakers was great. But at the end of the day, a chap called Ariel Eckstein did a keynote at the time - I think it was 2010 - on this platform called LinkedIn. Naber:\xa0 That\'s so early, so early. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, it was,. It was new at the time, and I think social media, still back then, was a that little bit misunderstood, particularly in businesses. Everyone was like, how do we understand social media? And so, Ariel did this talk and what they were doing, and I think they\'ve hit 50 million Members maybe at that point in time. And just this rocket ship growth, and how they were thinking about the role of something like LinkedIn in the talent marketplaces. It orientates it\'s professionals and networking. And I just left, totally inspired. It was a 40-minute talk. I was like, this is incredible. And just started hitting up everyone on LinkedIn I could find that worked at LinkedIn, and met a guy called Pat Traynor. And yeah, the rest is history to be honest. So I wasn\'t, it was one of these things where I wasn\'t looking to leave SHL, but the LinkedIn message was so compelling that I wanted to find out more. And again, when the offer came, it was a tough decision to make because I had so many good relationships at that company, and everyone was like, yeah, social media and LinkedIn, it\'s a fad. We\'re not sure. And it sends shivers down my spine to think that I may not have taken that role when I did, given the the experience I had there over six years and how many great people that I met. And so yeah, just one of these things I want to take a punt on. And yeah, thankfully it turned out in a really good way. Naber:\xa0 So you moved into, that\'s a great story, you moved into the Senior Enterprise Relationship Manager role looking after a bunch of customers around Europe, Middle East and Africa. Is that correct? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, back then the London hub was the EMEA presence, and I moved into a Relationship Manager role, and it was a new role. LinkedIn had just started to specialize away from these hybrid-type, customer-sales professionals to a more new business, relationship management, customer success type motion. And I went in at a relationship management level, and we were still trying to figure out the playbook for it and what that looked like. And it was fun, but it was chaos at the time, right. Hundreds of customers, no real process, but just a great environment to be in as we figured that stuff out, and new products coming to market, and working through some of those challenges. Yeah, it was fun. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. So I\'m going to look at LinkedIn as a whole experience before you jump into the Manager, Global Accounts & Head of Relationship Management scope that you had. Because there\'s a link between, no pun intended, but there\'s a link between the businesses that you\'ve been across at LPR, CEB, LinkedIn, Rungway and InVision. The businesses you\'ve been across to been at extraordinarily different phases of the development & growth of that particular business. I want to separate two things right now and ask you about them, because I think these are two of your superpowers, and you\'ve had a ton of exposure that other people can learn from. I want to separate two things - building great cultures, and building & retaining world-class talent and great teams. Naber:\xa0 So let\'s talk about building great cultures. How do you think about building...because when you moved to LinkedIn, that exposure you had to those cultures, same thing at InVision - I don\'t know about Rungway culture,, but I do know about CEB\'s culture - you\'ve had exposure now to so many great high performing cultures of some of the fastest growing businesses in the world. How do you think about building culture? Maybe a set of principles, or a framework that you use, or at least what\'s your mindset and then I can dive into that a little bit. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sure. I guess, if I think about LinkedIn, Rungway, and InVision - the common theme across all of them is just the purpose in those businesses, right? LinkedIn - connecting professionals to opportunity. I think 600 million people on that platform. The mission that they\'re sort of living every day, it\'s great. Rungway\'s mission - really powerful around, leveling the playing field for people in enterprises and giving people a voice on sensitive topics and access to mentorship, irrespective of what you look or sound, in quite hierarchical cultures. And then InVision - just this really powerful platform that\'s disrupting the way companies think about digital experiences, right? Every company in the world today is arguably a digital product company. Whether you\'re in pharmaceutical or automotive, or finance. The user experience now via screens is a huge differentiator for businesses and how they think about reorientating what they\'re doing, given the competitive landscape. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 All of these companies had great missions, but I think about the culture in these different phases and really tying that to what you\'re trying to understand or achieve as a business. So if you think about InVision at the moment, we\'ve got this really exciting products used by 5 million designers around the world, from some of the biggest companies - 100% of the fortune 100 - but we\'re still building in international, right? That\'s a lot of great things. But there\'s also challenging things that come with growing a team at breakneck speed, and adding people and changing process constantly. And so, I think when you think about culture, you\'ve got to pull in the context of where you\'re at as a company. And really think about defining that with clear vocabulary, so that people can understand what it is the culture represents and the types of behaviors that are going to help you succeed as a business. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 At InVision we\'ve gone through a company-wide exercise of codifying the values and making sure that that\'s integrated into how we define what it means to be at InVision and the types of things that are gonna help you be great. And we\'ve gone as far as building that into how we do employee engagement, and how we coach people and how we celebrate people. And so I would say like, creating a vocabulary around the culture and the values is huge. Engage your teams, talk to your business stakeholders, find out what it is you\'re trying to achieve as a company, and then use that context to define a set of language that people can really internalize and understand. And then think of ways in which you can bring that into everything you do. This can\'t happen in a vacuum. Too many companies stick values up on the wall, and they\'re great, but no one remembers what they are. And so I think these businesses, like LinkedIn, like Rungway, like InVision, in my experience, have all done a really good job of understanding the power of culture and creating an environment where people can understand it, and thrive in it, and contribute to it. I think that\'s an important part. Obviously lots of learnings through those, like InVision, we\'ve grown so quickly, we haven\'t gotten it all right over the last couple of years. But as you go through these mistakes, you learn, and you try and improve. And we\'ve just got some great people here trying to figure this stuff out. Naber:\xa0 That\'s great. So when you\'re thinking about...you mentioned defining, put together a set of language that\'s common across the organization and applying that to everything that you do. That sounds, both intuitive and maybe not intuitive at the same time, but those are the steps in the elements that you think are very important within building that culture. Do you have any foundational things that managers and leaders need to do in order to proliferate that language and proliferate the documentation, or the definitions you\'ve put together for what the culture is, and how to bring that to the people within their teams? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 100%. Yes. I think the documentation is really clear, like clear definitions and as many examples that you can bring to what it means, that that are real life examples of people who are living certain behaviors all the time, right? And so how then you bring that into all aspects of when you\'re recruiting people. Are you identifying those types of behavioral policies in the people that you\'re interviewing, and how are you doing that, and how can you make sure that that\'s consistent right through your hiring. Because again, InVision\'s a great business and we\'re growing quickly, but it\'s not great for everyone, right? As sales professionals, we\'re at a stage where we\'re growing a pace where things break all the time, and you\'ve got to embrace and love fixing that, and building process, and establishing the fundamentals of the company, not just the selling part. And so how we make sure that as part of our values and how we interview, we identify people who perhaps have got brilliant talent and skill on the sales process, but perhaps aren\'t quite ready for the stage that we\'re at as a company where there\'s a build component too. That\'s really important. We need to set clear expectations with people coming into this company that there\'s so much that\'s good, but there\'s also some challenging stuff. And if you\'re not the type of person that wants to thrive in an environment where you\'re having to build things as you go, and develop process, and help contribute to the sort of foundational things that are going to help InVision grow in international - it\'s not going to be a great fit, and you\'re not going to enjoy our culture. But people that look at it and say like, that\'s exactly where I want to be and I want to have an impact beyond simply the sale, that can obviously be quite exciting for some types of people. So yeah, document it, define it, integrate it into the types of people that you\'re looking to recruit, and then also set a standard for what great looks in your company too. How are people developing themselves against those examples? How do we celebrate them in one-to-ones...it\'s got to be throughout everything, right? And if there are people living certain characteristics everyday, as a leadership team and as peers, we\'ve got to create environments for them to celebrate and recognize each other for those because it\'s those types of things, I think, that just add to the quality of what we\'re doing culturally, everyday. Naber:\xa0 So you\'ve inched into, thank you for doing my job for me, inched into the land of the other two things. Remember I said I want to separate two things, one culture building. And that was an excellent answer with a bunch of specifics around steps and different pieces that people can use within the organization to then build up a great culture. Let\'s move over to team building. You mentioned, all the way down to interviewing, evaluating talent based on the different language and specific pieces of your culture you want to bring into the organization as well as develop. So when you\'re thinking about building great teams, what fundamental common things have you seen or executed - because I know you\'ve executed these at both LinkedIn and InVision - what common things have you seen between LinkedIn and InVision that they do extremely well with building great teams and building high performing teams? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 So I\'d say, both organizations do a really strong job of standing, what it is that they\'re offering, right? What\'s the value proposition to an employee joining LinkedIn? And in the same vein, what is it at InVision? Obviously their two distinctly different organizations, and those things will look different, but you\'ve got to understand what is it that you\'re offering. All of the great things, but also then you\'ve got to be super clear on all of the challenges too, and make sure that as you\'re taking someone through a hiring process, if they arrive on day one, what they get in the hiring process is exactly what they feel and expected and in that one experience. So I think both companies do a really good job of understanding that a little bit in the context of where they are. And again, we\'ve made mistakes, over the last couple of years, built the team really quick. There\'s definitely things that we\'ve learned over that process, but we\'ve got to make sure that when we\'re looking for people, the types of people that we hire are going to thrive and love what it is that we have to offer, and that people that understand it and choose to opt out, that\'s completely cool as well. And so I think definitely, some pieces there. And then I think InVision, and to a certain extent, I think LinkedIn did this well, how do you bring your teams into that process too, and give people a feel beyond, say a hiring manager, of the different types of individuals? InVision\'s got some really strong individuals in our teams and they play a big part in our hiring process. if I think about the last few hires that I\'ve made, part of the feedback that we got from them, is they loved the sessions they got with people on my team. And that was a real opportunity for them to dig in on what it\'s really like. I think bringing your employees into that experience and giving candidates that perspective through someone on the team\'s experiences is another powerful tool for telling that story. Naber:\xa0 Yeah. Let\'s actually pause on that for a minute in drill into a little bit more. How does that work? How are you bringing the team in, what\'s the process, or how are you bringing your teammates into that mutual two-way evaluation process as they\'re evaluating the candidate and the candidate evaluating what it\'s actually to be in that role as well as the culture of the business. How are you actually doing that in the candidate experience? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, definitely. So I guess, we have set criteria through the process that we\'re interviewing people against. So let\'s say a candidate gets to a stage where I\'ve had a couple of conversations and they\'re doing really strong, but there\'s an area that I\'d love us to continue to dig in on. I\'d provide that framework to someone on my team - give them all of the notes, the context - and they would then be equipped to go and have that conversation. But there would also be a flavor of like, this is a two way process, and I\'m always pushing on candidates to own this experience a little bit too. Like, we can do what we can to share our perspectives, but they should be interviewing us as well. And I want candidates coming in eyes wide open to all of the great things and all of the challenges that we face. And I think setting those expectations and creating a framework for people to have them is a great way just to be transparent, and give the team access to the types of people I\'m speaking to. And there\'s nothing better than an individual in the team coming back and saying - this person was absolute an rockstar, and having that cultural validation from other people too. Naber:\xa0 I love how you bring your team into it so explicitly. You\'ve mentioned multiple times something around the candidate choosing just as much as the company\'s choosing. And I\'ve seen a couple of the things that you\'ve written about, and you\'re talking about that two way experience and the choices on both sides - the candidates have the power, the company has the power. Reminding themselves that mutual evaluation process is extremely important. You write about that, I think in one of your LinkedIn articles as well. When you\'re going through that process, what explicit questions or types of examples are you using or asking for to help the candidate evaluate whether or not they are right for the stage of business? Like you said, InVision\'s of kickass set of products, company, great people, great culture, really fast growing, raised a bunch of cash, high valuation. On paper, it\'s a badass opportunity. At the same time, it\'s just not right for people, you said at the, at different phases of a business because some people just aren\'t ready for that, or they wouldn\'t thrive in that environment. How are you asking questions or what types of questions or examples you trying to get to make sure the candidate can make that evaluation themselves? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Great question. I guess just speaking openly about some of the specific challenges, right? If I think about our sales process here, the designer is so important in our company. The role of design in businesses, we want to elevate that voice, and we see the role of design and having more and more strategic influence in an organization, in terms of when an organization gets it right it\'s driving true business outcomes. And so the designer is everything for us. But that\'s just one stakeholder and several that we have to work through. And our process, beyond simply a champion in design, also we\'ll have a security component, and a data privacy component, and the legal components, the sales process can be long and complex. And then there are some of the cultural norms. In Germany for example, cloud is still in new and challenging technology for a lot of big businesses. And so some of our sales cycles in those markets take a lot longer, and therefore the resilience to work through that time, but also the discipline to manage the process and the stakeholders step by step and do all of those leading indicators up until the point that we\'re able to work on a partnership with the customer and sign that off - those are certain qualities that not every cell\'s environment will have. And I think the more that you can be specific about those types of things and look for evidence and examples of someone being able to work through that in what they\'ve done historically, but also thrive and enjoy that type of thing versus other sales cycles that might have fewer stakeholders and the less complicated paper process. And so I think the more that you can be specific on examples in your process and bring that to life for an individual...I\'m always looking for people to opt in, sell them a little bit against it where the fight is, like, this sounds exactly what I\'m looking for rather than overselling too much, and finding that some of this stuff becomes a shock to people. Naber:\xa0 Great tactic. I love that. When you were at Rungway and and when you were at LPR, when you don\'t have a brand behind you, and you\'re still a small business or even if you\'re really high growth business that\'s really great at what they do in tech, you are still an unknown quantity or an unknown entity to so many people, that you don\'t have the brand out there that says, come to us. We\'re going to attract people right away. So I think it\'s extremely important to remember when you don\'t have a brand that you still need...because your conversion rates at the back end and the middle end of the funnel for companies that have great employment value propositions and great employment brands like InVision or LinkedIn, those conversion rates are so much higher than a startup or or a midsize tech business. So I think that small and midsize tech businesses find it extremely hard to play the devil\'s advocate you just mentioned within the candidate interviewing and recruitment process to make sure that they\'re telling them transparently - these are the things that aren\'t rosy all the time, or these are the things that are really challenging that you may find difficult. I think it\'s even more important in those small midsize businesses when you don\'t have that brand equity, when it\'s really scary to do it, because you want to attract the best people and you\'re scared of someone looking in and seeing all those blemishes, if you will. I think it\'s even more important to do that. So I think that using that at InVision, using that at LinkedIn as a way to get candidates to, self identify the right opportunity, is is amazing that you guys do it, number one. Number two, I love the examples you used. Especially in different environments, different stages of disruption in the adoption for cloud based technology, as an example. And Germany versus the UK, as an example. I think those are great, nice examples. Solid. Thanks man. Naber:\xa0 Last couple things here, then we\'ll hop into some rapid fire questions. There\'s two more things that I want to specifically discuss. One is around building and reengineering a sales process so that it matches a customer facing, customer focus versus an internal focus. I think that you\'ve gone through, in all likelihood in two different businesses both at LinkedIn and then maybe even more explicitly at InVision, where you\'ve gone through a process of reevaluating and reengineering some of that sales process. What would you say to people that are trying to build a customer focused sales process and experience you\'ve had engineering one towards that versus, focusing on yourself and your own internal process? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think, if I take the InVision experience...InVision, has this really powerful brand in design, we love the designe. We spend a huge amount of time going beyond our product to thinking about how do we drive value in the community and the elevate this new growing community in businesses where designers now are differentiators for them. And so, if I think about that community piece, and we do things design leadership forum, which is a community for design leaders where we\'ve got a thousand people around the world that we bring together for these intimate dinners. And it\'s about networking and it\'s completely tool agnostic, but it\'s like how do we create a platform for people that are going through rapid change in their organization where there\'s not a playbook for the type of growth that they\'re experiencing, the number of products they\'re having to design for, the number of stakeholders that are having to collaborate with. And so I guess the first piece is, how as a company do you recognize that you\'ve got to drive value into the community that you serve beyond the products. To help just elevate the overall category and create best practice sharing and knowledge. So there\'s a piece around just making sure that you\'re heavily invested in that. And it\'s really inspiring to work at InVision because the content that we produce and the investment that we make into helping these individuals, and develop these new playbooks, and scale their design teams, and share that best practice - that helps. And I think from a sales process point of view, because the product is so strong and that we started as this self service business where, 5 million people sign up to InVision and now I use it to collaborate design ideas and stake holders, a lot of the conversations sometimes in the earlier phase would start at that product and feature level. And so one thing that we did to help in that early phase of the process was we\'ve developed something called, we call it a value pyramid. Essentially it\'s just a research framework that starts at the company\'s most strategic goal, breaks down what their strategic objectives are and challenges, and then ways in which we can create value for that. It\'s an executive summary slide, and it\'s really just a framework for researching what\'s this company talking about online that relates to digital and trends impacting their company, and how can we start every single conversation with a customer around those types of topics as part of the agenda, so that we\'re not being pulled straight into the products and features piece, but more into how what we do impacts real strategic business outcomes. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 And so that\'s one thing that\'s really helped us elevate our conversations beyond the products, which is important and we want to do, but connects us more to what a company is actually facing in their organization. And how does design play a role in fixing some of those things? That would be one example. Another is how do you then design processes outside of the design persona for us also to create value, right? We have more engineers on the InVision platform now than designers because so much of what\'s getting created in companies is this design idea that needs to be socialized across so many different business functions. Engineering being one, business stakeholders, legal, compliance, marketing. How do you get as many people involved around the design idea as early in the process so the end outcome is that much better. So for us, it\'s how do we go to different types of personas and have that value based conversation as well, outside of design, so that we can speak to the value of this operating system for all of that digital product, design, etc. And so lots of work around that. And the final thing, we\'ve developed a customer business review framework, which is really a template for ensuring that in our existing customers we\'re sitting down at least once a quarter and having a conversation about what\'s new in their organization, what challenges they\'re facing as a function, and how we can bring value through the different things that we do. And so, I think these types of tools just give our customer teams, more ammunition to spend more time on the customer than they do on features and our products, etc. Naber:\xa0 Hey, one quick question to dive into a bit of detail on your review documents that you have with the customer. You\'ve done so many of these with executives both at LinkedIn and at InVision, as an individual you have done so many, I know your team has too. Can you talk a little bit about what that document looks like? Either the length of it or the summary of what\'s in it, just so people get a sense for what you\'re including in that presentation or that document. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sure. Yeah. I guess, before even getting to the documents, so much of it is about what it is you\'re trying to achieve as the outcome of the meeting and who needs to be there. So before you even get to the document component, what stakeholders do I need to have in this conversation to ensure that we truly move the conversation forward and are as connected as possible to the challenges of this business faces. So the preparation that goes into defining the stakeholders, selling the value of why bringing those different types of people together in a meeting. You win and lose in the prep and all of that piece. So just make sure that this isn\'t a tick box exercise, but a truly strategic tool to figure out who needs to be there, why do they need to be there, and how do I communicate the value of these different functional leaders coming together to have a conversation around their company? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 And if you can get that piece right, selling the value and getting the right stakeholders, prepping to ensure that the outcome that you\'re trying to design for is the one that you\'ve reach - that\'s a huge part of it. The framework itself, I think orientate it around a clear agenda that\'s aligned to the outcome. Make sure that the lion share of the meeting is spent on the stakeholders and the individual challenges that they face, and how those are barriers to the outcomes that they\'re trying to achieve as a company. If you can leave every single customer business review having understood the three core challenges that a company spicing and why, and what are those barriers to them being successful - To be honest, that\'s a huge part of it. The rest feels downhill. Obviously the more insight you can bring to those conversations, insights driven from what the industry are doing, perhaps benchmark companies that they look to and see as really inspiring, whether that\'s in their industry peer group or outside of it, ensuring that you gathered that insight as part of your prep and that you lead with that - particularly when you\'ve get executives who are a key part of making sure all those types of engagements successful. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Great Segue too. So the last thing I want to talk about is selling to power and selling to executives. You just gave me a great segue. One of your superpowers that I think a lot of people admire is your ability to have really smooth, easy, fluid conversations that are very substantive, while at the same time, hugely impactful. Ha, I\'m giving you the feedback that other people have both told me and that I\'ve observed myself. But the point is, those characteristics as well as your structure and your science behind it make you very good at selling to executives and selling to power. Do you have a framework that you use or a set of principles that you use when you talk to executives in executive meetings? You\'ve just done that so much at CEB, at Rungway, at InVision, at LinkedIn, you\'ve done extremely well. What sort of framework or set of principles or using while you\'re setting up the agenda and having that conversation? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah, I would say the first thing that always goes through my mind is to try and look at the meeting from their perspective to try and put myself in as much as what I think is going on in their company. Again, from the research I\'ve done from the conversations I\'ve had. A recent example of someone on my team, they\'re working with a large financial services organization, and over the last six months I would say the conversations they\'ve had across that organization with all types of stakeholders across the business, and the time they spent just listening and gathering insight and understanding - nothing to do with communicating what InVision does, but really what this business is trying to achieve and the barriers that are stopping them, maybe reaching those things in the context of an annual report or anything else that you can find out about what they\'re doing strategically - all of that enabled us to, when we sat down with the CMO, in 30 minutes communicate more insight to that individual than perhaps he had been exposed to in a little while. And so I guess for me, you\'ve got to do the groundwork. There\'s no point turning up to these executive meetings with some sort of discovery conversation framework. You get short amount of time, they want to be educated, you\'ve got to have some type of insight. And you\'ve gotta be super clear on the outcome that you want from that individual. And so for us in that specific example, we wanted his sponsorship on something and we were super clear about that and had earned the right to ask for it because we had turned up with a very clear vocabulary, framework, ask and the insight based on a ton of ground work we\'ve done in that business. And so, for me it\'s just do the research, do the prep, look at it from that perspective. Know that they\'ve got a short amount of time where they could be talking to any type of vendor, and therefore if they can\'t leave that room feeling they\'ve learned something or got something clear that they can action, I would say go back to the drawing board. Naber:\xa0 Nice. That\'s great. One quick follow-up to that. You mentioned prep and doing the pre work multiple times in this conversation. How important is it to have, or do you need to have specific examples within their company on what\'s going on, or a strategic insights from their business - from an annual report, or inside conversations you\'ve had, or things you can find online? Or do you feel you can go in with some sort of, either your competitor does this this, or other types of organizations you have said x, y and z? How important is it to have something company-specific versus more general but that applies to their industry or their competitors? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yes. It\'s a great question Naber:\xa0 One quick insert in here. The reason I ask that is because that is a product of a lot of time that someone spends doing the pre-work, whether it\'s hours, or whether it\'s an hour. And I know that they evaluate the time that they\'re going to spend as to whether or not they do it or not. And that\'s why I\'m asking that question, because I know that comes up on a daily basis people sitting down doing that pre-work. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yeah. Çompletely. I would say firstly, it\'s about the stage in the process & the ask. In the example that I gave to you, the ask was quite clear about how we can help them with a recommendation about their organization. Right? So it wasn\'t necessarily the start of the conversation where we we\'re looking to build a relationship. We had done a lot of stakeholder engagement across lots of functions at a quite senior level, C- minus one or two in some cases. And in this example it was like, here\'s our recommendation, here\'s how it\'s been validated across all of these people with all of this business case. Will you support it? So that, I would say in that stage is a different type of executive engagement, where you need to have done the ground work. In an earlier stage where perhaps the executive engagement is more at the beginning of a process, where you\'re looking to start top down and go straight in at that level. I think any type of insight that is anchored in what you know about the company, what you know about the industry, what you know about their benchmark peers - is really strong. If you\'re at the beginning of something and your ask is maybe introductions to more people on their team, or them to work with you on a specific problem that you solve really well as a company. I think that\'s a different type of ask, but equally requires the same amount of prep, right? And I go back to what\'s the size of prize and what is it you\'re trying to achieve in the context of the goals that you have? And if this is something that you genuinely believe with this person is going to move your business forward. There\'s no amount of timeframe on the prep that, in my mind, is not worth doing. If you truly want to meet the outcome and you\'ve decided that that\'s a key priority for you. Naber:\xa0 Great answer. DSG, you\'ve been excellent with your time. Let me run through some rapid fire questions and then we\'ll wrap up, that okay? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Go for it. Yeah. Naber:\xa0 Your favorite place to snowboard in the world? What is it? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Tahoe, dude. Easy. Naber:\xa0 Tahoe, nice! That was so fast! Why Tahoe? Naber:\xa0 I\'ve just got so many great memories there. I learned to board in Tahoe. It became for me and just the group of group of friends, somewhere that we would try and go at least once a year as part of kickoffs that we did and stuff that. And so I\'ve just got so many great memories of learning to board there, great days on the slopes, hanging out with friends. Yeah, it\'s absolutely awesome. Naber:\xa0 Oh, love it. Okay - second question. Best food city in the world? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Ooh. I\'ll say London. Naber:\xa0 That is such a cheating answer. That\'s so cheeky that you would say that. So I just saw that you were in Italy not too long ago and I thought to myself, you\'ve been a lot of places with a lot of good food, especially in the last few years. So London is, London is still your answer. DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Amalfi coast was incredible. Obviously loved the food and Italy, but London\'s just so international, so diverse, so many great restaurants. Yeah it\'s it\'s a pleasure for me. Best city in the world. Love living here. Naber:\xa0 Love it. Love it. Okay, your best one or two interview tips for someone that is going into an interview for a role soon? I know you\'ve written about this, and you\'ve done a shed load of interviews. You\'ve also advised people and companies on this type of stuff. Any interview, one or two interview tips that you would deliver? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I would say, research the person that you\'re interviewing with. Look at the company, there\'s so much available online now to individuals, there\'s no excuse for it, right? So Glassdoor reviews, LinkedIn, people that work there, people with similar job titles, who invest in the company, what sort of portfolio do they have? Who\'s on the board? To be honest, there\'s so much available to everyone now, and so I would say all aspects of those things would be, would be really important. Naber:\xa0 Awesome. Do the prep. And then last question is around overcoming age in senior roles. You\'ve had a lot of large responsibility at a young age, even in your teens and early twenties. Any advice for making that an asset versus a liability? A lot of people are...I know I asked a question similar to this...but any either general advice or advice to those that are younger with a lot of responsibility? DSG:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I would just say be yourself. Acknowledged gaps. From my point of view, again, there\'s still so much that I have to learn and improve on, and I think just be comfortable with that, right? Whether you are managing people that have more experience than you or not, whether you work in environment where your peer group, find common ground with people and just embrace who you are and take a level of enjoyment in what others brings to the conversation too. So I think as long as you\'re not trying to be something that you\'re not, then you\'ll be absolutely fine in my opinion. Naber:\xa0 Hey everybody, thanks so much for listening.

In this episode of The Vertical Mindset Podcast, Sasja and Eitan discuss the concept of The Super-Mind and creating your culture of excellence. | Today there are many ways to describe an organizations culture with words like innovative, combative, fun, positive or negative, agile - but what does this really mean, and how does it support or set-back progress? If you were to ask any CEO, or organizational leader, whether or not they believe that having a culture of excellence is important they will inevitably say yes. Yet, many leaders find it difficult to articulate\xa0why\xa0their organizations culture is important to the success of their business over time. The impact of culture can be seen in the day to day interactions between colleagues, it is visible to your customers, and it will impact your bottom line. | \xa0 Mindset focus is key for maintaining your vertical life. There are a handful of things that you need to be attentive to if you are going to maintain your vertical mindset and life over the course of your lifetime. The first is that of mental focus. You have to establish patterns of mental remembrance or discipline that help you refocus your mind on the vertical things you’re living for. Eitan shares a few of the ways you can begin those good habits on this episode, so be sure you take the time to listen. Emotional health: Key to focusing on what is most important in your life. We all have great ambitions and things we know need to be an important part of the lives we live. But we don’t often realize that if we allow our emotional health to decline we’ll be shooting ourselves in the foot when it comes to those higher goals. On this episode, Eitan shares the kinds of things you need to pay attention to in order to maintain emotional health. If you can put these into regular practice you’ll find yourself to be more resilient and strong when it comes to staying focused on your vertical life goals.\xa0 If your body isn’t strong, your vertical focus will suffer. Have you ever been at a place in life when you were so physically exhausted that you couldn’t think straight? It’s in those moments that everything looks hopeless and our emotions prompt us to give up. But there isn’t any truth in those feelings - they came from the fact that our body was out of steam. On this episode, Eitan covers why physical energy and health is so vital for staying on track toward your larger, life goals. You’ll learn some practical ways you can keep yourself healthy so you will be able to endure the slog required to successfully live a vertical life. If you can’t stay on track in life, you likely don’t have a structure to help you do it.\xa0 Staying on track with your vertical mindset doesn’t happen purely through willpower and good intentions. It happens as willpower is coupled with structures you put in place that prompt you to stay on track. Eitan knows that can sound a bit ambiguous until you get into so he dives into examples of some practical structures he uses, on this episode. You’ll find the description of what he does to keep himself on track very instructive when it comes to determining and devising your own structures. Be sure you listen. Outline of This Episode  [0:10] Introduction to this episode on sustaining the vertical life and mindset. [0:45] How to keep your mind focused on your bigger “vertical life” issues. [2:27] Emotional energy is key. [3:02] The physical component of sustaining your vertical approach to life. [5:06] Spiritual focus on your highest values help you stay aligned with a vertical way of living. [6:05] What happens when you get knocked off track in these areas? [7:30] How to set up a structure that helps you stay focused. [9:51] Refocusing and recalibrating is like building a muscle through repetition. [11:47] The deficit you put on family if you don’t manage your energy throughout the day.  Resources Mentioned  The Productive App  | We hear it a lot these days, people talking about being real or living an authentic life. But what does it really mean? Some people advocate total honesty in everything, expressing exactly how you feel about every situation. Is that being authentic? On this episode, Eitan Sharir shares what he understands it means to live authentically. It’s not about performance and it’s certainly not about being the center of attention - and it's not always about total honesty, either. Find out what a truly authentic life looks like and how you can live in a more authentic way, on this episode. What does it mean to truly be authentic? When Eitan was asked what it means to be authentic he said two simple words: Being myself. An authentic person is one who is self-aware, they know who they are and what they believe. They also know how to live consistently with those beliefs and that identity without being pushed around by the opinions and perspectives others might express. An authentic life is one of conscious, confident choice about how you will show up in the world. Find out how you can live a more authentic life by listening. When you are busy surviving, you don’t have the capacity to live authentically. Many people in our day are busy surviving. They haven’t taken the time to establish a vertical mindset that enables them to live for more than their own interests. Consequently, they rush from situation to situation, reacting as they go. That is the direct opposite of living an authentic life. Authentic living requires self-awareness and the ability to choose your own role and behavior in the world. It’s not a life of reaction, it’s a life of intentional investment. Find out more on this episode. Is it authentic to share everything happening in your life? Some people feel that if they don’t honestly share everything they feel and think about a given subject, they are being inauthentic. But is that true? Eitan Sharir says, “Not necessarily.” What determines whether a person is living authentically through honest sharing depends on their reasons for sharing and the mindset behind their sharing. Are they trying to benefit others? Are they attempting to make the situation better? Or are they simply venting, unburdening themselves at the expense of others? Eitan has wisdom to share on this episode about how you can become more self-aware so that your honesty is truly authentic, so be sure you listen. Does the mindset of “fake it ‘till you make it” have a place in living an authentic life? People often say, “fake it ‘till you make it,” and the words themselves sound incredibly inauthentic. But what’s meant by the phrase is that if you don’t feel confident or capable in a situation, you should keep practicing, learning as you go until you reach competence. There’s nothing inauthentic about that, it’s the process by which we grow and gain confidence in our abilities. But if it turns into lying about your ability for the sake of saving face or covering up your\xa0need to grow, you’re headed in the wrong direction.\xa0 Outline of This Episode  [0:10] What does it mean to be authentic - to live an authentic life? [6:00] How can you deal with difficult or confidential information and still be authentic? [9:08] Is it necessarily authentic to share everything going on in your life? [10:48] Does “fake it ‘till you make it” have a place in living an authentic life?  | You may not be familiar with the term co-creation or the concept of co-creating with others. But it’s something you’ve at least seen done and hopefully have taken part in yourself. Co-creating is the process of two or more individuals coming together in a cooperative, collaborative relationship for the purpose of creating something that has not existed before and that could not be created without the input of all the people involved. There are tremendous benefits to co-creative relationships, so listen to this episode to hear Eitan’s explanation of the co-creation process. The more horizontal people are, the less team oriented and collaborative they are. In the past episodes of this series, Eitan has made a distinction between having a horizontal mindset and a vertical mindset. Each is an approach to life that determines the way individuals choose to live and relate to others. Co-creation happens best when the parties involved have all made a conscious choice to live according to a vertical mindset - a mindset that intentionally seeks to live for something bigger and more significant than themselves. It’s this mindset that allows the collaboration needed to fuel the co-creation process. On this episode, Eitan discusses how to foster your own vertical mindset for the sake of co-creating. Generous collaboration is at the heart of co-creating.\xa0 A person who has a vertical mindset is outward focused, eager to benefit others with their life and interaction. That kind of generous attitude enables them to be open to the possibility and benefits of true collaboration. Co-creating reaches its zenith when that's the case. On this episode, you’ll discover what co-creating is, how the process works, and why it’s a tremendous way for teams and families to work together to accomplish amazing things they couldn’t have done without collaborating.\xa0 Is co-creation something that can happen in families?\xa0 The primary discussion in the first part of this conversation centers around how workplace teams can practice co-creation for incredible results. But are there other contexts in which co-creating is possible, such as the family? Eitan responds to that question with enthusiasm and describes many ways in which co-creation is beneficial to all kinds of relationships, including those that happen inside the home. Be sure you take the time to listen. Effective co-creation depends on understanding each other and a focus on common goals. Everyone has their own set of self-centered goals that they take with them as they enter relationships. It’s a natural part of being human. But when a person makes the shift into a vertical way of thinking and living, they begin to seek to understand others. It’s this desire for understanding that enables them to see that others are not necessarily in competition with them, they just hold a different viewpoint. Understanding and appreciating the views of others is what\xa0 enables collaboration and effective teamwork toward common goals. Eitan describes how this sort of mindset fosters effectiveness in co-creation, on this episode. Outline of This Episode  [0:10] What does it mean to co-create with other human beings? [4:27] How does co-creating actually work and come to life in the workplace? [9:51] Can co-creating happen at home with our families? [12:26] Is co-creation in families structured the same as it is in the workplace? [14:51] How can you co-create with those who don’t understand the need for a vertical mindset approach to life?  | What is the absolute best investment you could make? Eitan Sharir says it’s not a financial one - it’s the investment you make in yourself. And he’s not talking about more education or more letters behind your name. He is talking about the inner you, the centered, stable self inside that needs to have emotional maturity and strength in order to wisely handle the stress and demands of the world. On this episode, you’re going to hear Eitan share his own story - how he discovered his own need to invest in himself. You'll also learn what he’s done to make that investment consistently throughout his adult life. He says it’s the best investment he’s ever made and believes it will be for you, too. The best investment doesn’t have to do with money. It has to do with yourself. When you think of investments you are thinking in terms of putting something to work in order to receive a greater gain in return. We seem to easily think in those terms when it comes to financial investments or education. But when it comes to developing ourselves, we don’t see the correlation as easily. But the best investment you can make is in your own inner health. You need the stability to handle the pressures of life calmly and with wisdom - and that takes investing in yourself, systematically, over time. Eitan shares the benefits of making that commitment, on this episode - so be sure you listen.\xa0 How can people who are educated and successful resort to behaving like a 3-year-old? You’ve seen it happen. The person in charge of a meeting at work or with many degrees and accomplishments flies into a tirade when things don’t go their way. How is it possible that someone so recognized and accomplished could behave in such a way? It’s because our culture has spent so much time focusing on intellectual and skill development and so little time on inner emotional development. The two need to be integrated in order for a truly healthy human being to emerge. On this episode, Eitan shares what it means to make investments in yourself, what it looks like practically, and why you need to do it. You’ll be intrigued by what he has to share. Investing in yourself requires daily commitment. You might listen to this episode and agree that the best investment you can make is in yourself. You might be motivated to get started right away. But make sure you understand this - investing in yourself is a long game. You can’t be hit and miss about it and expect to see much in the way of positive results. It takes daily work, daily practice to see the benefits. Just like any discipline, this one requires your time, attention, and mastery - over time. Find out the practical things you can do daily to invest in yourself, on this episode. What happens in your life when you actually make the investment in yourself? You truly won’t believe the difference daily investments in yourself make to your life. You’ll find yourself able to detach from the circumstances of life in order to assess them wisely, without reaction, without a feeling of threat or insecurity. You’ll be able to see that you are entirely separate from the circumstances you face and can then make better decisions and treat people with more kindness and gentleness. Those are just some of the benefits that come from making the best investment you can make - an investment in yourself. Find out more on this episode. Outline of This Episode  [0:25] Why don’t people change when they really want to change? [3:50] In order to be fully functional we need to be balanced in mental and emotional development. [5:42] The results of NOT developing yourself. [7:31] What does it look like to make the best investment in yourself? [12:33] Daily practices that enable you to make your best investment in yourself. [14:37] The biggest difference these practices have made in Eitan’s life. [16:14] How can you see your need for investing in yourself?  | If you take the time to look around you, you’ll see almost everyone trying to pull off the balancing act between home life and work. You hear it expressed as a desire to achieve work-life balance, but Eitan Sharir believes that the “work-life” approach to balance implies that work is not really “life,” when in fact, it is just as much an important part of life as being at home with family members. For him, it’s an issue of greater purpose, and on this short episode of The Vertical Mindset Eitan shares how he guides people to understand the power of life purpose, being a chooser, and the impact those two things make on their own balancing act. Balance is not in what you do, it’s in what you focus on. When you try to balance out your life, the primary issues that come up are those of distraction. You are home with your family but still feel the tug of work-related items or deadlines. Eitan says that the key issue when seeking to perform a balancing act effectively is that you know your life purpose and are committed to living according to it. It’s that knowledge that enables you to make the right choices and to apply the depth of your desire to whatever situation you are in. You learn that balance is not about what you do, it’s about where you place your focus at any given time. Learn how to be 100% at work when you are working and 100% at home when you are at home, in this episode. A key component in work-life balance is to remember that you are a chooser. Do you feel that you are in control of what happens in your life, or do you feel that things happen to you? It’s an important distinction - one you need to fully grasp and apply to your own life. When you understand the power you have to be a chooser, then you are able to push aside the demands and outside pressures you may feel at any given time and apply the power of choice to the situation. Nothing outside you need place a demand on you - you are able to choose what is best for you at any moment. So when you are at home, you can choose to BE at home, with your family, engaging in what is important there. Find out how Eitan Sharir applies vertical living to the balancing act of life, on this episode. If your family is most important to you, why do you live as if they aren’t?\xa0 We all live with a certain level of contradiction in our lives. We say one thing yet live our lives in ways that appear and in fact, are contrary to that thing. For example, almost every executive Eitan speaks with says that their family is most important to them. Yet, they allow work and work-related issues to intrude on family time regularly. The power to change comes in realizing that you have the power to choose, that you are in all actuality free from the pull of outer demands. You simply have to choose to live that way. It may sound a bit simplistic here, but if you’ll take the time to listen to Eitan’s explanation, you’ll be helped greatly. When you are clear on our bigger purpose it’s easier to say “No!” to the right things. Our brains simply cannot handle the weight of continually mounting responsibilities. We have a limitation on our capacity as human beings. That’s why we have to learn to say, “No” to some things in order to take on others. But how do you make wise decisions when it comes to knowing what you should say “no” to? Eitan Sharir says that your decision to say, “no” flows out of your larger life purpose. When you become crystal clear on why you are living your life, the decisions about what you will take responsibility for and what you will not becomes equally clear. Do what you can to set aside time to hear his explanation on this episode. You’ll be glad you did. Outline of This Episode  [1:03] The reason people feel a need for work-life balance, and how Eitan looks at the problem. [4:23] Handling situations practically: How do you manage being fully present in each context? [9:33] Why we don’t keep adding tasks to our load without removing others. [11:36] What are the things Eitan sees people most commonly decide to stop doing? [14:22] How can you know when you are doing things from a right motive or from a sense of obligation? [17:49] Learning to notice when you are living in a state of division rather than fully in balance.

Of the consequences of decisions. Of the accuracy of the information on which you based the decisions. And the talent of the staff on whom you depend to carry out those decisions. And yet, Ruth Browne is not afraid. She makes decisions quickly. And laughs easily.

It’s extremely common in business settings and for many people, it brings up painful memories of tedious annual performance reviews which never resulted in any progress. But done right, feedback is at the core of every successful team.So, what do you need to do to set the tone for an effective system? What is positive and negative feedback? How do you give constructive criticism? Do you care about the evolution and development of your team? We’ve talked in the past about the importance of self-awareness and on your path to develop the right environment for feedback, that self-awareness is be an essential tool.On this episode, Mathew and I examine the foundation you need to build to successfully provide and receive feedback. We also discuss Mathew’s experiences with feedback during his stint in corporate America, the shortcomings of the standard annual review process, why self-awareness is critical for leaders, what to ask yourself before giving feedback, and so much more!Be sure to join us next week for the second half of the discussion on feedback.

Today we’re diving deeper to the next level of the halftime of life and if you’re approaching the halftime, we want to help you to develop the tools you’ll need to have a meaningful conversation with yourself about where you are today and where you want to be in the second half.Life is perplexing and societal pressure leaves a lot of us with our heads down, chasing the dream of career success, marked by power and money. But I'm here to tell you: it will not be enough. Whether you’re in your 20s, 30s, 40s or 50s, there are certain questions you should ask yourself to cultivate the right mindset to live a full and significant life. These questions, combined with the principles shared by Bob Buford in Finishing Well, make up a framework that will help you navigate the halftime and avoid the territory of the midlife crisis.On this episode, Matthew and I discuss the 20 questions you should ask yourself today, how self-reflection about the halftime can help you to become a better leader, the effects of a midlife crisis on leadership, why significance is more important than success, how you can benefit from the self-reflection of halftime even if you’re not yet at that age, and so much more!How do you feel about halftime? Has this discussion made you think differently about your life as you approach or come through halftime? Have you had a new revelation as you hit the third or fourth quarter? Do you think we missed anything? We want to hear about the impact these conversations are having on you.

That natural break point in your life is known as the halftime of life. It’s that time where you look back at the first half of your life, check the scoreboard and adjust the game plan for the second half.Today’s conversation is part one of a two-part series and we’re exploring the halftime model as a concept. What is halftime and how does it work? When is the halftime of life? What questions will you ask yourself? In becoming the consummate leader by attraction, understanding the halftime model will help you improve the way you lead and will give you a framework for approaching your goals, aspirations, and ambitions.On this episode, Mathew and I talk about how the halftime model was developed, where it fits in the timeline of life, the type of self-reflection that happens at halftime, why you should become your own cheerleader, the different approach to halftime for second and third generation leaders in family businesses, and so much more!What do you think are you in the halftime of your life? If you’ve already passed the halftime, what advice would you want to pass on to the next person who hasn't quite approached it? We’d love to hear your experiences.Be sure to join us next week when we’ll be doing part two on the halftime model where we’ll dive into what halftime means specifically for leaders at the midpoint in life and how to finish well.Key Topics:•Mathew shares a little about his story and where he is in relation to the halftime of life (2:44)•Why it doesn’t matter whether your career has taken a direct or an evolving path to halftime (5:00)•The development of the halftime model (6:04)•The connection between Bob Buford, the creator of the halftime model, and Peter Drucker (7:02)•The halftime metaphor (8:00)•Where halftime fits in the timeline of life (10:47)•The main developments of the first quarter of life (11:12)•How most people realize they’ve reached halftime (14:16)•The type of self-reflection that happens at halftime (14:58)•Evaluating meaning and purpose after years of pursuing society’s standards for success (15:16)•Why you have to become your own cheerleader (18:40)•How halftime affects second and third generation leaders of closely held legacy businesses (20:13)•The impact of increased longevity and changing workplace dynamics on people’s expectations for their life and work (22:58)•And much more!Mentioned in this Episode:•Bob Buford, author of Halftime: Moving from Success to Significance•Young Presidents’ Organization•The Halftime Institute•Peter Drucker•DISC Behavioral AssessmentSee the show notes and a transcript at https://sheerclarity.com/podcasts/the-halftime-model-part-1-what-is-it | How you show up in the world and your strength as a leader has a deep connection to the strength of your worldview. On your path to sheer clarity, with self-reflection and by asking the right questions, you’ll develop your personal theory of the world which helps to guide you on the journey to becoming the consummate leader by attraction.Many people get caught up being busy making a name for themselves, building their career and paying their bills and overlook the value of being introspective. But having a strong conviction in your worldview is the bedrock for creating long-term success. So, what is a worldview and what questions should you be asking yourself to get clarity around it? And how does your worldview factor into the type of leader you are?On this episode, Mathew and I explore why you need to get clear on your worldview, how to approach questions of mortality and the meaning of life from a non-religious perspective, the essential questions for you to ponder so you can determine what your worldview is, why belief in a higher power can be empowering, and so much more!Have you started on the path to clarifying your worldview? If we’ve raised questions for you, reach out to us and tell us about your experiences. We’d love to hear from you.Be sure to join us for next week’s episode where we’re looking at another important exercise for leaders at the midpoint in their life known as the Halftime Model.Key Topics:• What is a worldview?

At first glance, it seems like a paradox, but we came away from that discussion realizing that it was possible through self-awareness. This week, we’re diving in even deeper to help you develop this virtue in yourself as you continue on the path to sheer clarity.As we continue our discussion about humility, we want to understand not only whether it is something that can be learned, but also, if it is, the best way to do so. How does someone ruled by ego move to the opposite end of the spectrum, where they become the consummate leader by attraction by embracing their humility? Stick with me here: I strongly believe that transition doesn’t start without a belief in a higher power.On this episode, Mathew and I explore what we mean by a “higher power” and the key areas you need to master to develop your humility as a leader. We talk about why pride and ego can’t live alongside humility, why you need to negate the negatives of your personality, how to handle a boss who lacks humility, how to leap from the limelight, and so much more!Do you think humility can be learned? We’d love to hear your experiences with humility and leaders who you’ve seen in your career transition into being humble leaders by attraction. What were these leaders like before transitioning, and what behaviors did they exhibit afterward? We’re excited to hear your thoughts.Key Topics:•Mathew’s biggest takeaway about having humility while being a big personality (2:29)•Why I believe humility doesn’t work without a higher power (4:19)•My definition of a higher power (4:52)•Why taking a step back from your problems can help you to embrace humility (8:00)•How painful life experiences can teach us humility (8:48)•Viewing humility as a voluntary surrender of ego (10:16)•Learning humility by negating the negatives of our personalities (11:37)•Why you need to offset your ego with empathy (13:41)•The first steps you can take to learn humility (15:00)•How I get through to clients with a lack of self-awareness (16:39)•Can you help someone oblivious to their lack of humility?

Worthington Jr.’s Book | Humility: The Quiet VirtueSee the show notes and a transcript at https://sheerclarity.com/podcasts/developing-your-humility-as-a-leader | Humility is fundamentally an incredibly powerful leadership attribute. Despite that, from Jack Welch to Elon Musk, many celebrated leaders in recent history are not known for displaying humility. Beyond that, our selfie culture seems to promote values that are quite the opposite.So, why should we as leaders be interested in the virtue of humility? Coming from our last episode about how you will measure your life, I want you to join me on another level of self-reflection and talk about the importance of humility for leaders.A leader by attraction has a brand that’s associated with positivity and using their power for the good of others. It’s making the conscious choice to put others ahead of yourself. And it all starts with understanding what humility is and how it is applied in the real world in leadership settings. To help you on the path to sheer clarity, today we’re unpacking humility and the misconceptions that often surround it.On this episode, Mathew and I talk about the connection between a company’s enduring value and its leaders, what humility in leadership looks like, why humility is so hard to define, breaking the misconception that humility is a weakness, how to assess your humility, and so much more!Stay tuned for next week’s episode where we’ll look at how you can develop your humility as a leader. Until then, share your experiences with us about humility and the leaders you’ve had in your career or your own experiences with incorporating humility into your leadership style. We’d love to hear from you.Key Topics:•The link between a certain type of leadership and the creation of enduring value (1:54)•The paradoxical qualities of a Level 5 Leader (3:06)•How a humble leader approaches their team (3:59)•Why humility is difficult to define (4:34)•Mathew’s experience with a leader with a great sense of humility (6:55)•The type of leaders our “selfie culture” focuses on (8:46)•Well-known leaders who represented the antithesis of humility (9:28)•Why you need courage to be a humble leader (11:21)•My definition of humility (12:19)•The noble choice of humility (12:57)•How to assess your humility (14:53)•Building a brand with positivity and humility (16:50)•Why your brand story is so important (18:09)•The role of humility in creating this podcast (20:01)•And much more!Mentioned in this Episode:•Jim Collins’ Book | Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don't•Level 5 Leadership•John Dickson’s Book | Humilitas: A Lost Key to Life, Love, and Leadership•Stephen M.R.

I’ve found myself coming back to this article by Harvard Professor Clayton Christensen time and time again because it perfectly captures a message that I try to point out to all my clients: While we can be focused on all the things that the world wants us to focus on, that’s not what you're going to be remembered for.Our society and culture are focused on money and power. From a young age, our educational system teaches us that achievements, awards, and an outstanding resume should be our number one priority, while little or no emphasis is placed on developing character. But while those things are important and oftentimes necessary, we almost universally agree that they are not the most important.In becoming the consummate leader by attraction, you have to turn your attention to your character. So, how will you measure your life? How does this question impact your leadership? How does it tie in with finding your purpose? Are you proud of what you will be remembered for?On this episode, Mathew and I look at the impact of society’s prioritization of power and money over relationships, the aspects of your life you should be focused on, what it takes to create a lasting legacy, why it’s easier to talk about our accomplishments than our character, how your decisions reflect your values, and so much more!We’d also love to hear from you. Share with us how you were measuring your life prior to listening to this episode, and whether you’ve now made some adjustments after reading the articles, books or simply from hearing this discussion between Mathew and me.Key Topics:•Why I wanted to dedicate an episode to the topic “How Will You Measure Your Life?” (1:09)•Mathew’s perspective on measuring the impact of your life (3:05)•Why Clayton Christensen’s article resonated so much with me (3:51)•The two types of virtues (5:13)•The problem with the cultural focus on achievements and accolades (5:55)•The important insight Clayton Christensen gained from Intel’s Andy Grove (7:02)•Why leaders should aim to help people find their own solutions (9:10)•The three questions you need should ask yourself (10:23)•Why power and money shouldn’t be your sole focus (11:00)•The reason many people prefer to talk about what they’ve done instead of who they are (12:14)•Why you should talk about the importance of your values, especially in an interview setting (13:51)•Mathew shares how his values, priorities, and vision for himself have shifted over the years (15:33)•Coming to terms with having to sacrifice some of your passions and dreams for yourself (16:30)•Recognizing how your values are reflected in the decisions you make (19:17)•Why relationships should be your number one investment (23:02)•Why you should focus on your family (25:14)•And much more!Mentioned in this Episode:•Clayton M.

Despite the fact that creativity and innovation are intrinsically linked to exploring the unknown, embracing your own uncertainty can be terrifying. As we close the door on our series on appropriate vulnerability, we’re taking a deep dive into a very specific aspect of vulnerability: imposter syndrome.Imposter syndrome affects people at every level and your experience with it might range from manageable fears that are quickly dealt with, to frequent anxiety and the feeling of waiting for the other shoe to drop. If you’ve been applying the self-reflection we spoke about in past episodes, odds are that you’ll encounter imposter syndrome on your journey to becoming the consummate leader by attraction.As a leader, how do you deal with imposter syndrome? How can it get in the way? How do you manage it appropriately? And it’s not just about you. Once you become more aware, you'll be in a better position to help your team restore their confidence, unblock them, and enable new levels of productivity and efficiency.On this episode, Mathew and I reflect on how we became aware of imposter syndrome and the fact that it is truly a universal issue. We explore the different ways it shows up in leaders, why being a second-generation leader often requires extra preparation, how to identify imposter syndrome, the importance of self-reflection and being conscious of your own insecurities and anxiety, my top two techniques you can use to manage imposter syndrome, and so much more!Key Topics:•Mathew’s experience with imposter syndrome (2:11)•The origins of the term “imposter syndrome” (3:01)•Defining imposter syndrome (3:25)•How imposter syndrome usually shows up in leaders (4:17)•The connection between self-doubt and imposter syndrome (5:00)•The range of experiences on the imposter syndrome spectrum (6:16)•Why imposter syndrome sometimes feels like waiting for the other shoe to drop (7:41)•Differentiating between everyday worrying and imposter syndrome (8:07)•Why you need to be conscious that imposter syndrome is a possibility for you (9:39)•Why executives of closely-held businesses are more susceptible to being disconnected from their own uncertainties and anxiety (11:13)•The current leadership’s responsibilities to the next generation (13:33)•The key to developing second-generation leaders for a successful multi-generational business (13:55)•The challenges I experienced as the non-family member President of a family business which was under-prepared for growth (15:53)•How Mathew became aware that he was affected by imposter syndrome (17:53)•Why figuring out where your imposter syndrome stems from is the first step to managing it (19:30)•How your family history ties into your view of success and self-worth (20:05)•The impact of my family’s insecurities on my achievements and my anxieties (20:40)•How to do a 30-minute purge as the second step in managing your imposter syndrome (22:43)•Why you’ll keep getting stuck if you’re comparing yourself to others (23:58)•Using appropriate vulnerability to combat imposter syndrome (24:35)•Seeing uncertainty as an opportunity, rather than weakness (25:55)•And much more!Mentioned in this Episode:•Dr. Pauline Rose Clance & Dr. Suzanne Imes’ Article | The Imposter Phenomenon in High Achieving Women: Dynamics and Therapeutic Intervention•The Work of Byron KatieSee the show notes and a transcript athttps://sheerclarity.com/podcasts/battling-imposter-syndrome | In the past couple episodes, we’ve talked about what appropriate vulnerability is, why you need it, how to be vulnerable and how to approach vulnerability as a leader. Now we’re looking at the final element: how to encourage appropriate vulnerability in others.What does that environment look like? How do you pull it off? What are the benefits to you as a leader? Years of research has shown that the biggest factor that impacts employee engagement is their relationship with their boss. It’s up to you to set the tone in your workplace and show your humanity to your team. Your approach to vulnerability and your willingness to share appropriately with those around you can make or break strong connections. And those connections are crucial to achieving your business goals and becoming a successful leader by attraction.On today’s episode, we’re exploring how to encourage people in the workplace to be vulnerable with you and key techniques you can use to encourage that vulnerability. Mathew and I share vulnerable moments we had in the past week, how collaborating and vulnerability are intrinsically linked, why you have to walk the talk, the types of questions you should be asking in your business meetings, and so much more!You’re also going to want to look out for next week’s episode where we’ll be doing a wrap up of the three aspects of the sheer clarity model, trust, honesty, and appropriate vulnerability, and how they fit together to help you on your path to achieving sheer clarity.Key Topics:•How this show is a vulnerability exercise for Mathew and me (2:07)•Why co-hosting Sheer Clarity creates additional vulnerability for Mathew (3:17)•My two main motivations for creating Sheer Clarity (4:16)•How The Halftime Model plays out in our motivations and perspective (5:25)•Why collaborating with others requires vulnerability (6:48)•Modeling appropriate vulnerability to improve connection within your team (8:34)•The huge impact that a leader’s approach has on employees’ feelings toward their work (9:48)•The number one factor that affects employee engagement (9:48)•Why I like to ask vulnerability-style questions in traditional, goal-oriented business meetings (11:59)•How employee concerns can provide important insights (13:14)•Why you should be making time for stories in your update meetings (13:47)•Mathew shares a happy moment and a sad moment from his week (15:56)•I share a moment that made me smile and a moment that made me sad (17:57)•The power of vulnerability in bringing together a team (20:21)•And much more!Mentioned in this Episode:•Gallup | Employee Engagement•Peter DruckerSee the show notes and a transcript at https://sheerclarity.com/podcasts/appropriate-vulnerability-part-3-encoura | Vulnerability isn't about winning or losing. It’s about having the courage to show up and be seen.As business leaders, we set audacious, future-oriented goals that inherently have an element of risk. The bigger the goals, the bigger the risk. In those moments where the outcome is uncertain, vulnerability is a key part of the equation. And being vulnerable enough to understand where you need help and when to ask for that help is a huge part of becoming a successful leader by attraction.So as a leader, what do you do if you’re not sure about your vulnerabilities or how to approach them? Is it too late to change if you haven’t embraced vulnerability with your team in the past? More than that, does it really make a difference to your team and your business when you create that environment of vulnerability?Today we’re talking about how to approach vulnerability as a leader and how to put yourself in a vulnerable position that’s appropriate. Mathew and I dive into how vulnerability can be your greatest strength, what appropriate vulnerability looks like for a business leader, how to change if you’ve been a closed-off leader in the past, how to start identifying your vulnerabilities, and so much more!You’re also going to want to look out for next week’s episode where we’ll be finishing up appropriate vulnerability by looking at how to encourage it in others.Key Topics:•Mathew’s insights from our previous episode about appropriate vulnerability (2:31)•How vulnerability can be one of your greatest strengths (4:13)•The powerful advantages of leading with appropriate vulnerability (5:10)•Why it’s impossible to build deep relationships without vulnerability (6:54)•How to make a change from being a closed-off leader (8:35)•Why our vulnerabilities are often the last parts of ourselves that we figure out (10:19)•The lasting impact of childhood experiences (10:55)•Getting in touch with your own vulnerabilities (12:03)•Using my two worksheets to help you to start getting in touch with your vulnerability (12:22)•Breaking the belief that being vulnerable means you’re not worthy (13:48)•How closing yourself off from vulnerability stifles your business’ potential (14:34)•Why highly effective leaders must do deep self-examination (15:34)•The positive steps you can take once you’ve identified your triggers (15:50)•How getting a grip on your inner critics will help you with your vulnerability (18:50)•And much more!Mentioned in this Episode:•Brené Brown•Brené Brown’s Book | Rising Strong: The Reckoning.

Some of the greatest innovations throughout the course of humanity happen because of generational differences. From a generation who said we will no longer judge a man or a woman by the color of their skin, but the character of their heart; to a generation determined to tear down a wall dividing Germany during the Cold War. Each generation longs to make their mark upon history. Yet, as each generation comes of age – so to speak, there are struggles we all share – no matter how different we all seem.One of these similarities are aging parents. Every single generation reaches a point where taking care of mom and dad become a top priority. How will we ensure their physical health, mental health, and even spiritual health? On this episode, we’re sitting down with the Executive Director of Fox Run Retirement Community Mike McCormick, and having a conversation about how we start that conversation with our parents now, so we can create an effective plan when that times comes.

As a patient, one may assume a hospital's main priority focuses on solely increasing revenue, where as a healthcare professional may completely disagree, citing their personal driving factor of genuinely assisting an individual in need.

Paul has a background in the airline industry, and he worked at Sabre Holdings. They sent him back to business school and through what he calls a meaningful collision, he discovered a need and an opportunity which led to Opargo. We talk about how data can be used to make significant and surprising changes. Paul also shares how data can’t be used unless it is tracked. He also gives actionable tips and a three-step process to look at your business and your data to really understand where opportunities are and where to go. These tips can be used in small and large businesses. This show will give you a better understanding of the possibilities of improving your operations with the use of data.\xa0 Show Notes:  [06:03] Paul worked at United Airlines and Sabre Holdings on the corporate side. [06:29] Paul went back to business school, and while he was there, he met a doctor who had the problem of working more and making less money. [06:48] He started looking into if there was an opportunity to apply yield management and the data aspects of the airline industry to the healthcare industry to help physicians become more efficient and help patients get better care. [07:02] They use predictive analytics to understand which patients are coming in and who needs care the most. [07:25] Yield management is the idea of a limited amount of supply and a limited amount of demand and applying these together to be as efficient as possible. [07:48] Grocers came up with the original idea of yield management. [13:16] Data can be used for all sorts of purposes, even why you are having trouble finding tech talent, and where to place your office. [15:17] Paul shares a story about helping a specialist get patients. They pulled the historical data. They also looked at referral patterns. He was getting his brother-in-laws patients in as fast as possible. The story is that it's important to have a Happy Thanksgiving.\xa0 [19:03] They look at how busy providers are. Some are too busy, but there may be some that are under utilized. They look at methodologies to help utilization be evened out. This helps get patients in faster. [22:41] Meaningful collisions are opportunities to learn and grow. [23:26] You want to be purposeful and intentional with each encounter. [24:58] Paul shares how Opargo was started by a meaningful collision.\xa0 [26:51] Listen to understand instead of listening to respond. [28:06] Being intentional in a conversation can be a great help when looking to hire for talent. [30:42] To affect change through data you have to track it. What drives your customer behavior and how can you take action with that type of buyer? You need to take the information and drive changes in your business.\xa0 [33:39] Pick one place where you can have an impact and build from there.\xa0 [34:20] Base decisions on data not emotion.

She is an author, motivational speaker, and organizational psychology expert. Her advice has helped some of the largest corporations in the world, but also applies to small teams. She is the author of  You First: Inspire Your Team to Grow Up, Get Along, and Get Stuff Done and  The Good Fight: Use Productive Conflict to Get Your Team and Organization Back on Track.\xa0 In this conversation, we learn why conflict can actually be good and desirable as long as it is handled in a healthy way. Dr. Davey also shares two magic phrases that diffuse tears and anger. We also learn a three step validation process that can turn potential conflict into an opportunity for communication. She also shares her concept of conflict debt and how to deal with things so that conflict doesn’t build into a negative part of the team dynamic.\xa0 Show Notes:  [06:28] Dr. Davey has always been fascinated with factories. As she got older, she realized that teams are the modern factories in business.\xa0 [07:05] She also discovered the field of organizational psychology and studied how teams and team dynamics affect innovation.\xa0 [07:25] She has spent the last 25 years helping teams deal with the messy people stuff, so they can get back to business.\xa0 [07:43] Dr. Davey got an email from Google this week while working in Silicon Valley, since she was in the neighborhood she stopped by and had a great conversation.\xa0 [09:05] Her and her husband work with executive teams helping them with business strategy and how teams operate together to be better aligned.\xa0 [10:19] Dr. Davey shares how conflict debt is a lot like credit card debt.\xa0 [12:07] The interest on conflict debt can get so debilitating that businesses can't be the business they were meant to be.\xa0 [13:14] Connectivity can be causing some of these issues. Now there is no escape. [15:01] Dr. Davey shares a story about how conflict adverse leaders can fail to do their job.\xa0 [17:16] As a manager, the first responsibility is to let people know that conflict is normal. Conflict is the purpose of the teamwork.\xa0 [18:57] Everyone running a small business should have a conversation with the team saying that if the sales person isn't annoying you the sales person isn't working enough.\xa0 [20:00] The number one thing you can do in your business is to help people understand where they're supposed to be putting tension on things. [21:20] The most important moment is the first moment that you mess up. What you do when things go wrong determines who can be trusted.\xa0 [22:34] Validate the thing someone says. Ask a question to understand where they are coming from. Say their truth.\xa0 [24:59] When humans are validated they are then willing to pivot. [26:47] Have a conversation about conflict and tension and clear the air using validation techniques.\xa0 [28:49] Solving a mistake made for a customer is an opportunity to build a much stronger relationship with that customer.\xa0 [31:35] Conflict resolution only takes a couple of minutes to set things right up front.\xa0 [35:15] What we can change is us. Teams are a dynamic. You changing your role will change the team.\xa0 [37:33] We stay out of things for many reasons.\xa0 [39:35] When people don't feel heard or understood, they come across as the wicked team member.\xa0 [41:02] If you still have human employees, you still have emotions. You want healthy non-drama interpretation.\xa0 [42:45] If someone starts to cry, you say this is important. What do I need to know? The same thing works when someone starts screaming.\xa0 [45:28] The only people at work that get upset are the people who are engaged. [46:35] Dr. Davey shares a story about a woman leading an all male team who used emotion to do its job.\xa0  Links and Resources:  Liane Davey Liane Davey on Facebook Liane Davey on Twitter Liane Davey on LinkedIn  You First: Inspire Your Team to Grow Up, Get Along, and Get Stuff Done  The Good Fight: Use Productive Conflict to Get Your Team and Organization Back on Track  Subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever else you like to listen.

[11:22] Amie always felt like Osterville needed a neighborhood bakery, she also knew she wanted to retire there one day.\xa0 [12:20] Working in a bakery is physically and mentally demanding. It's a different kind of work, but you get used to it. [13:11] She also had a lot of administrative work to do. Running a business, it's hard to be in the kitchen all the time. She is more of a creative director.\xa0 [14:15] Amie is fortunate enough to have an amazing team. She still works 12-15 hour days with the launch of a new location.\xa0 [15:26] She wears multiple hats but wouldn't have it any other way. [16:16] It's important for business owners to give over power and get help like hiring a manager. [17:01] It's important, if you want your business to succeed, that you do delegate and you do trust. [18:13] It's important to always have cash flow and really listen to your team. The team is in the trenches. [20:42] It's also important to educate your team and let them know why things are done a certain way. Communication is everything. [23:29] Amie is always planning ahead. She is always looking forward. She is also obsessed with food and building a brand. She has to decide what she is going to work on now and focus.\xa0 [25:15] She hired an agency to create her brand and launch. She then found a space and opened.

[27:06] She has a lot of great expansion ideas and projects. AMIE is a play on the French word for friend, and Amie has a lot of brand expansion ideas from mixes to baked products and educational products.\xa0 [27:53] It's hard to do everything at once, so Amie's plan is to carve out a plan and then get the right people in place to execute.\xa0 [28:01] She likes to hire people who are experts in what they do.\xa0 [28:42] Andre and Amie have been friends for years.\xa0 [29:09] Osterville is a beautiful community. A garage that Amie had her eye on finally became available. She hired a builder and built the facility that she needed. She hired experts to help her become successful.\xa0 [32:32] When someone has a dream and wants to do something that they are passionate about, they just need to try. It will be a lot of hard work and preparation. If your willing to do the work, put in the time, plan ahead, and have the resources you need, you will succeed.\xa0  Links and Resources:  AMIE Bakery AMIE Bakery on Facebook AMIE Bakery on Twitter AMIE Bakery on Instagram  A Sweet Look at AMIE Bakery  Subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever else you like to listen.

Just in case you don’t know Ryan, he is the Inc. 500 CEO of The ASK Method® Company, and the #1 national best-selling author of Ask, which was named by Inc. as the #1 Marketing Book of the Year. His work has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Forbes, and Entrepreneur and over 250,000 entrepreneurs subscribe to his email newsletter offering business advice.\xa0 Ryan started from humble beginnings but went on to attend an Ivy League college, have a successful corporate career in China, and give it all up to start over to build his own business. In this episode, he shares his struggles and successes and the winning framework he discovered for business success. We talk about his book Ask and his new book Choose. He shares the five marketing must haves for a viable business today, and so much more.\xa0 Show Notes:  [07:41] Ryan came from a blue-collar background. He was the first in his family to go to college. He went to an Ivy League school and studied neuroscience, East Asian studies, and Chinese. [08:02] After graduating, he worked on Wall Street. [08:36] Ryan then decided to live and work in China. He and his wife spent five years in China. He was opening up sales offices for AIG. [09:02] Ryan felt unfulfilled. He had a great salary and a great corporate career. Then he woke up one day wondering is this it. [10:02] Ryan wanted independence and freedom. It was his goal to make $10,000 a month, so he could quit his job. He then discovered, his company might go under. This was the sign he had been looking for to finally make the leap. [11:58] If you've ever felt like you have more to give, the time to make a footprint and leave a mark is now. [12:17] Ryan quit his job and moved into student housing with his wife.\xa0 [13:05] They had a lot of conversations about what type of business for Ryan to start. His wife showed him an idea from Etsy.\xa0 [14:49] His wife pointed out how lucrative teaching can be. They started teaching people how to make Scrabble tile jewelry.\xa0 [16:25] Ryan learned the lesson that they had stumbled upon a fad market.\xa0 [17:07] They went back to the US and his wife got a job. [17:28] Ryan started researching evergreen hobbies. The one he stumbled upon was gardening and orchid care. [18:59] They moved to Austin, where they live now and grew their business. [19:16] They have done this in 23 markets and are now in their third year of being on the Inc. list of fastest growing companies.\xa0 [19:43] They went into several niche markets refining the method that he teaches. Some examples are memory improvement, water filtration, teaching how to play tennis, golf, and guitar and dog training markets.\xa0 [20:28] Every niche followed the same path where they would identify a market opportunity, ask a series of questions to understand the unmet need, and build a funnel to generate sales.\xa0 [21:01] A few years ago, they shifted their focus to teaching this methodology. They wrote the book called Ask. It became a runaway success. Ask is about figuring out what people want to buy.\xa0 [21:35] Their new book Choose. is about how to choose the right market to go into in the first place.\xa0 [21:54] Choose is about who you want to sell to. Many people make the mistake of focusing on what. You need to identify who is your who. [25:38] When you get refined clarity about who you are serving, it makes all of the other decisions easy. [29:04] We've been teaching this methodology for years, they are proven processes.\xa0 [30:31] If you start your business in the wrong market, you will never get to where you want to go.\xa0 [32:00] The five market must haves include being in an evergreen market, being in an enthusiast market, an urgent problem, future problems, and be in a market filled with PWMs or players with money.\xa0 [34:29] Use Google Trends to see if your Market is Evergreen. [36:25] You want to be in an enthusiast market not a problem solution market. [38:52] You need to find a burning urgent problem that people need to solve now.\xa0 [40:41] You are now set up to be a trusted adviser in that space and solve future problems.\xa0 [42:38] PWMs or players with money are able to buy what you are selling. You can't sell to broke people.\xa0 [43:59] The dog market is filled with PWMs where people spend a disproportionate amount of their income.\xa0 [46:32] The fear of giving up good to go after great holds so many people back. The Choose Method is designed to mitigate risk through a repeatable process.\xa0  \xa0Links and Resources:  Ryan Levesque Get Choose Free Plus the Audio Version and 25 Markets to Go Into  Ryan Levesque on Facebook  Ryan Levesque on LinkedIn Bucket.io Jim Collins Google Trends  Subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever else you like to listen.

Kevin is the founder of The Shoeshine Guild where he and his team offer an unparalleled shoeshine experience for special event attractions and in-store experiences. They have locations in New York, San Francisco, and Osaka, Japan. He was also featured in the documentary The Art of the Shine.\xa0 Kevin is an entrepreneur, artist, entertainer, and sobriety advocate. On last week's episode, he shared his childhood and upbringing with us in his own colorful way. He also talked about his 30 years of sobriety that began when he had a white light experience at a facilitated event. This week we continue our conversation as Kevin shares more about that white light experience.\xa0 Show Notes:  [02:07] Kevin wasn't happy with himself. He went to the event that his sisters had talked him into going to. He walked into a dark room and they started doing creative visualization. [02:28] As Kevin was walking through his emotional junkyard, he had a white light experience. His eyes were closed and he saw a light. He also heard a voice say Kevin you have a problem with drugs and alcohol. He then started having the thought that he didn't want to drink anymore. He wanted to be sober. [03:31] This was August 16th, 1988. He started telling everyone that he is sober. It was like a switch, he had no desire to drink.\xa0 [05:14] He had so much energy, he didn't know what to do. He was overwhelmed with a wave of hatred towards past grievances. All of his feelings bubbled to the surface.\xa0 [06:51] He started going to meetings, praying, working out, and looking for any help he could get.\xa0 [07:53] He smoked two to three packs a day. He also worked as a bar back. He was searching for something and running out of things to do.\xa0 [09:39] Six years later, he became suicidal. Until he met a new woman. She taught him to take a written inventory, and he discovered that the 12 steps really did work.\xa0 [16:06] Kevin became an overzealous AA advocate and really tried to convince everybody he knew to get involved. [17:30] After getting out of the army, Kevin said that he would never shine another pair of shoes, but this woman who he met was actually a shoeshiner. He tried shoe-shining, and he loved it. [18:32] He started managing a shoeshine stand in San Francisco. He hired all of his friends, and they became the sober shoeshine crew. [19:54] He ended up wanting to buy the shop. He put together a business plan and his professional customers helped him.\xa0 [22:24] They built beautiful chairs, and he had one stand. He ended up buying another stand and then another. They started swing dancing and shining. They did eight seasons with the Giants, and then took over the Moscone Convention Center. They grew and did conventions all over the country.

This is a company that he founded in 1996 by shining shoes at conventions and special events. He took on a partner and recruited friends to work with him. This company offers a retro experience along with a great shoe shine. The shiners are in huge demand and are also expert swing dancers in this retro industry. Kevin has a common bond with his founding crew, because they were all recovering alcoholics.\xa0 In this entertaining and moving episode, Kevin talks about his upbringing in New York in the 1970s, and belonging to different gangs on the East and West coast. He talks about his Irish upbringing, moving to San Francisco when he was a teenager, joining the Army at 17, and how he began drinking and then was struck by sobriety.

This part is Kevin’s story up until he decided to get sober.\xa0 Show Notes:  [07:36] Kevin is Andre's next door neighbor.\xa0 [08:20] Kevin got sober in 1998.\xa0 [11:30] He is up for a small business award at the Irish Echo.\xa0 [12:03] When he was 16, his family moved to San Francisco. Young Kevin didn't like it there. He was in a gang in New York and then joined a gang in San Francisco.\xa0 [15:21] The first time Kevin got drunk was in California in 1977.\xa0 [17:44] He went to the Fame school in Harlem. He didn't like it. Kevin wanted to be a comic book artist. He then started hanging out with the kids and drinking all day. He was 13. [22:37] His gang member friends were mostly children of Black Panthers.\xa0 [23:46] One of Kevin's friends encouraged him to join the Army. He went to Germany and began to see the world. He was 17. He also just began drinking. He jumped out of helicopters and was a machine gunner.\xa0 [27:28] After 32 months, his tour was done. [28:45] Kevin shares how he got stabbed and made the mistake of messing with a catheter in the hospital.\xa0 [29:36] He was 20 when he returned to the States. After a Tijuana trip gone bad, it may have been time to talk about getting sober.\xa0 [32:21] Kevin knew something was wrong and tried a process suggested by his sister where he had a white light spiritual experience. This is when he heard a voice say he had a problem with drugs and alcohol.\xa0 [33:48] This is when he decided that he wanted to be sober.\xa0 [34:37] It was like a switch. He was struck sober and hasn't had a drink in 30 years.\xa0  Links and Resources:  Sleep No More VR & U with Amber Osborne The Shoeshine Guild The Irish Echo  Subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever else you like to listen.

Jay is the creative director and founder at Angry Bovine. Jay is a traditionally trained graphic designer with a diverse client and employment background. He is passionate about delivering creative works that build brands and clearly communicate client objectives.\xa0 In this episode, we spend a lot of time talking about the importance of having a brand no matter what size your business is. Jay feels that a brand is a promise and the logos and design are what portray that promise. Jay shares his story of how he started working as a designer and how and why he started his design company Angry Bovine. He also talks about the design process that he and Tracy used when coming up with branding materials for the LOCALiQ events.\xa0 Show Notes:  [06:32] Jay is a traditionally trained graphic designer. He learned communication and layout in the International Swiss style.\xa0 [07:46] Right out of design school, Jay started working at an Internet startup. Communicating through pictures was an interesting challenge.\xa0 [09:22] Jay was a junior designer with a wide skill set. He was also one of the only designers, so he took every opportunity that was offered to him.\xa0 [10:16] Jay worked through both dot com booms.\xa0 [10:35] Working at an agency is what inspired him to start his own business.\xa0 [11:47] In 2008, Jay moved to Boulder, CO. He had independent clients come to him, which made it very convenient for him to start his own design business.\xa0 [13:07] It's really cool to look back and ask why that worked.\xa0 [14:39] Jay likes to work directly with decision makers and not dilute the process.\xa0 [17:20] A lot of Jays design relationships are ongoing. [17:37] Angry Bovine was critical with the launch of LocaliQ and then they got pulled into The Growth Lab.\xa0 [18:13] The one thing Jay can't teach clients is curiosity and enthusiasm.\xa0 [18:29] The Growth Lab does live events all over the county. They wanted a lively brand and turned to Jay. Jay and his team created logos and banners for the live events.\xa0 [20:40] Tracy said it was like Jay understood what was in her heart. [21:18] He has been a creative director and designer on both sides of the fence. You learn more about your clients on the walk to the conference room.\xa0 [22:53] Jay wanted to know what it was like taking the show on the road. What she wanted to carry is part of the design process. He is interested in the execution and the aesthetic.\xa0 [25:44] Big businesses still use people like Jay, just in a different role. Small businesses should never underestimate the investment in brand.\xa0 [26:36] You want to be the easiest to understand and the most engaging when compared to your competitors. Brand matters and creates a rule book to live by. Your brand is who you are and what you stand for as a brand.\xa0 [29:22] Your written brand isn't chiseled in stone. Your brand can evolve with your business. [31:49] Use your brand document to determine what you should do as a service and for your mission. [32:05] A brand is a promise. Logos and things are what draw you into that promise. [33:11] Building a community is a really strong business tool.\xa0 [35:47] Entrepreneurs are creatives who make stuff happen. They are the experts of their brand. [37:35] There are so many great resources out there. Take a leap of faith and find someone to help with your branding within your budget.\xa0 [39:55] Propose a price. Don't be afraid to find someone to help you build your brand.\xa0 [41:19] You own your authenticity.

Jeannie is the founder of NextTribe a magazine for women who are 45 + that offers information, inspiration and a healthy dose of irreverence. Jeannie began her career as a journalist in New York and wrote for several well known publications. She then got married, moved to Texas, and started a lavender farm.\xa0 Eventually, Jeannie and her husband took their two sons and moved to Mexico before traveling the world and homeschooling her sons. Jeannie wrote about these experiences and realized that her cumulative life experience qualified her to do many things including run her own business. Jeannie is a champion for women and women in business in the 45 + age group. The mantra of her magazine is age boldly. We have an inspiring conversation that many women and people over 40 can relate too.\xa0 Show Notes:  [11:54] Jeannie is joining us today from Texas.\xa0 [12:32] She has a background in journalism and after college, worked in New York at several popular magazines including Allure, Time, Life, and more.\xa0 [13:37] After her kids went to college, she wanted to find something out there for her, so she founded her own business and website.\xa0 [15:02] Jeannie's first taste of being an entrepreneur was being a lavender farmer in Blanco, Texas. This was a big change from New York.\xa0 [16:07] Her husband was inspired by the lavender farms in Provence.\xa0 [17:02] They ended up with 96 different lavender related products and made it into a real business.\xa0 [17:48] Her first book was about a New York journalist becoming a lavender farmer. [18:20] The family then sold the lavender business and moved to Mexico. After 4 years in Mexico, they traveled the world and homeschooled their children. [19:00] She also wrote a book about that experience. [20:12] Jeannie has had so many careers that have benefited all of her business experience.\xa0 [21:04] NextTribe also curates trips for women which Jeannie is an expert at planning. They have retreats in Mexico at areas that she knows well.\xa0 [24:14] Jeannie spoke at SXSW on a panel for women entrepreneurs who are 45 + years old.\xa0 [28:32] A lot of women with incredible experience can't get an interview because of ageism. This is one reason why women keep starting businesses.\xa0 [30:06] Her panel was well received, because so many women want to start businesses and make it work.\xa0 [32:28] Some issues that hold women back are fear and self excluding. [35:23] When in your 50s with nothing to prove is a great time to start a business.\xa0 [36:36] NextTribe is equal parts information with a healthy dose of irreverence. It was important to have the best writers providing content. Jeannie had a long list of contacts that she could rely on.\xa0 [39:54] Good writing is able to identify thoughts and feelings that readers have but can't articulate. [45:19] Advertisers are becoming more aware and looking at Jeannie's age group as viable for advertisers. [48:05] Now more women are doing their own thing and setting the parameters that they want.\xa0 [51:48] If women can have more control it would be a great change in the corporate culture.\xa0 [53:10] Look through your contacts and appreciate your network and don't self exclude to start your business and make the most of your life experience and push into those areas.\xa0  Links and Resources:  Jeannie Ralston NextTribe Jeannie Ralston on LinkedIn  The Unlikely Lavender Queen: A Memoir of Unexpected Blossoming  The Mother of All Field Trips: Homeschooling Two Kids in 14 Countries SXSW Tammy Shaklee Lyndie Benson Ricki Fairley NextTribe OUTLOUD  Subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever else you like to listen.

Jenny Thompson is the CEO and Founder of SafetyPIN Technologies, as well as the author of  The 3-Day Business Cleanse: How to Get the Sh*t Out of Your Business and Get Things Moving Again. In today’s episode, Jenny shares her business background. She talks about being promoted to manager and the mistakes she made as a young new manager. She realized she needed to improve her leadership skills and in the process became a better leader and a better business person. We have a no-holds barred conversation about what it takes to run a business and manage people. Jenny shares when cuts need to be made with products and people. She even shares a straight forward firing script. We also talk about the four quadrants that are included in the 3-Day Business Cleanse. This a fun and lively conversation. Jenny even has a hilarious story about how she was inspired to create a new start-up called SafetyPIN.\xa0 Show Notes:  [04:27] Jenny decided to dictate her book, because it was the same process that she is given in presentations. She shared the presentation with her dogs, and they were riveted. [06:10] The process of dictating it made it a better book. [07:58] Jenny worked for a health publisher, and there was a sink or swim mentality. She went from 1 employee to 45 employees. She shares (in her book) how this was a learning experience. She realized that she was a horrible boss and lost sight of the hierarchy when being promoted.\xa0 [13:43] Jenny knew it was time to brush up on her leadership skills and read The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. [14:17] As a boss, you're going to have to be willing to be the most hated person in the building. Jenny took responsibility for her previous actions and started working on her leadership skills.\xa0 [16:55] She started bringing people who she clicked with into the company.\xa0 [18:23] She decided to do an audit of all of the products that her business was promoting. If a product didn't contribute $50,000 net, they got rid of it.\xa0 [19:49] Eliminating distractions is such an important part of focus and resources.\xa0 [21:41] The Three Day Cleanse is about unpacking. How you define what you do is important because it defines your KPIs. The first day they define what the business does, and they look at the products, then they redefine the SWOT analysis.\xa0 [24:29] Marketing is like sex. What you do is fine, but what everyone else does is either extreme or prudish.\xa0 [25:16] What are you better at than anybody? Every company has something that the employees are embarrassed by. Customers should be able to take time with the product. Stop doing the thing employees are embarrassed by.\xa0 [30:28] Sales goals can limit success. Goals define failure. Jenny looks at dreams as opposed to goals. They break down dreams that are real and attainable.\xa0 [34:37] Distractions need to be identified and gotten rid of.\xa0 [36:37] Starting at no and letting people defend products is a much better starting point.\xa0 [38:01] Day two is where they create the product grid and assess everything. Resources aren't only money. In fact, money is the least important resource. [38:41] A low opportunity and a high resource product gets a skull and crossbones and that project is killed. [41:02] Significant opportunity without significant resources is the thing that we focus on. [42:32] When doing a 3-day cleanse, hire a facilitator that's not afraid of the CEO. [44:19] On day 3, they do a creative brainstorming to position the five most important things that they are going to work on. [45:29] Have someone you know and trust facilitate for a small business.\xa0 [46:52] It's important to be able to fire people who aren't performing. This can be an issue especially for small businesses. [47:52] Reticence to fire people is a weakness in leadership. If you would be relieved that the person is resigning, then firing them is probably a good idea. Give someone you want to stay a raise.\xa0 [49:14] Jenny shares her firing script.\xa0 [54:24] Jenny has her own startup called SafetyPIN which is a universal trust badge representing online screening.\xa0\xa0  Links and Resources:  jENERATE Marketing jENERATE Marketing on Facebook @jeneratemktg on Twitter  The 3-Day Business Cleanse: How to Get the Sh*t Out of Your Business and Get Things Moving Again  The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership: Follow Them and People Will Follow You SafetyPIN  Subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever else you like to listen.

Tara and a violinist friend of hers created Sweet Harmony where they play music at weddings. [08:05] Tara has been playing piano since she was a child.\xa0 [09:36] After 10 years of classical lessons, Tara began learning jazz piano. Jazz opened a new world of improvisational playing for her. [11:30] Tara started learning Chinese in High School and lived in China after college. She was totally immersed in the language. She taught jazz piano. It was a very rich experience. [14:00] When Tara returned to the states, she started building her career as a music teacher. [17:44] The business Sweet Harmony has been growing thanks to Tara's business plan of removing the obstacles and letting growth happen organically.\xa0 [18:30] Tara shares examples of where fear can take over, and she would end up being the obstacle. She realized that she needed to research and expand to meet customer requests.\xa0 [20:37] Prayer has helped Tara with running her business. [21:08] Her business is 10 years old. It didn't take long to add more musicians to the network. They now have a network of several hundred.\xa0 [23:31] Sweet Harmony will be there for you up to the day of the wedding.\xa0 [25:00] Tara shares top skills she has honed as a business owner like not letting emotions run the day and considering everything before making decisions. [26:56] Because of Sweet Harmony's fast growth, Tara has to remain nimble and be willing to readjust when needed.\xa0 [27:23] Sweet Harmony has experienced exponential growth including 100% growth in the beginning years.\xa0 [29:05] Social media is becoming more important.\xa0 [30:56] When it comes to running a business, you have to find time and make sacrifices, but the rewards are great. [32:55] It helps to think like a big brand and remove friction. [34:22] Some people are very particular about their music choices. Sweet Harmony does charge when they have to learn new music.\xa0 [36:09] Having favorite songs played live is very special.\xa0 [37:01] They offer small ensembles and play a variety of music. [38:26] They have an app coming out in a year. They want to offer quick, easy, and quality. [40:29] Technology has created an open playing field for businesses of all sizes. [44:59] Tara went to play for a marriage proposal and she was so into her solo that she missed her cue when a plane flew over to pop the question.\xa0  Links and Resources:  Sweet Harmony Tara Buzash @TaraBuzash on Twitter  Tara Buzash on Facebook Think Like an App with Neal Polachek Oscar Peterson Chick Corea Jason Moran Jessica Williams Hank Jones  John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman New York Standard Lionel Hampton  Subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever else you like to listen.

Skip says that daily discipline can make all the difference. Have a picture of what success looks like for you, and make small steps, every day, towards that goal. That kind of laser-like focus on your dream is what it takes. | In discussing the\xa05th\xa0of 9 traits of servant leaders, Skip and his panel remark on how we live in an “encouragement desert.” Even if we were to give 6-9 times more encouragement, research tells us that it still wouldn’t be enough to fill the need we have to hear that we are worthy and valuable. How can you, as a leader, develop the habits – and a culture – of encouragement? Listen and find out. | Today’s “Wednesday Wisdom” comes from legendary basketball coach, John Wooden: “Reputation is what you are perceived to be, character is what you really are.” Skip talks about how, while many of us think that our character is something fixed and permanent, it really isn’t! You can work your reputation, and you can also take control of your character. They’re both important! Find out how, and start today. | In this, the 4th of 9 panel discussions about the traits of servant leaders, Skip and his panel talk about how important it is for leaders to recognize “the whole person.” Because even at work (perhaps especially at work), we’re not just workers. As Skip points out, we are more than “human capital” or other degrading terms like “head-count” or “warm bodies.” Servant leaders recognize that the best leaders respect, trust and care for the whole person. Listen for some good tips on how to do just that, while still respecting some important boundaries.\xa0 | Today’s “Wednesday Wisdom” comes from Eleanor Roosevelt: “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” Belief is foundational to everything we do. It’s the power that connects our dreams, which may feel unreal, to a future in which we do what it takes to make them happen. | Tim Sanders is a tech pioneer, NYT best-selling author and the former Chief Solutions Officer of Yahoo! In this interview with Skip, he shares the three keys to creating a sales leadership mindset. First, be intensely curious. Second, commit to delivering value with every interaction. Third, answer every question with a “Yes!” Tim also talks about the value of diversity of thought, and why “four is the magic number” when you’re looking for diverse perspectives. | In this, the 3rd\xa0of 9 panel discussions about the traits of servant leaders, Skip and his three guests talk about how true leaders don’t just lead—they build up other leaders. Why spend time training others to lead? Because the only other option is to be, as Skip puts it, a “superhuman leader” yourself. That’s bad for several reasons. First, it puts all the pressure on you, leaving no room for error. Second, it provides no growth for new leaders. And lastly, it means that your organization won’t benefit from other leadership styles. The panel goes on to provide some great, actionable tips on how to help “lead leaders” within your team.\xa0 | Amy Blankson is bestselling author of “The Future of Happiness.” A graduate of Harvard and Yale, she focuses on how to achieve happiness in a digital era.\xa0 She is a co-founder of the Digital Wellness Collective and most recently has shared her thought leadership as a speaker at TEDx and as a regular contributor for Forbes on Women, Technology, and Leadership, and as a featured professor in Oprah’s Happiness course. She and Skip discuss how leaders can use technology to help improve happiness outcomes for their teams, and for themselves. | In this, the 2nd\xa0of 9 discussions about the traits of servant leaders, Skip and his panel talk about the importance of building a culture of trust. The conversation touches on the components of trust and how you can quickly identify which cultures are based on trust… and which are based on fear. Why worry about trust? Because, as panelist Drew Bordas puts it, “Trust gives you a shortcut to efficiency.” | A servant leader is not one who does all the work or who is mild and easily swayed. Servant leaders provide strong guidance and direction by understanding what motivates customers, employees and shareholders. In the first of nine parts on this topic, Skip and his panel discuss how valuing diverse opinions is absolutely mandatory for a successful leader.', 'chan_desc': 'Your journey to becoming a great leader will never really be complete.

Workplaces can also fall victim to groupthink by over-collaborating.\xa0Stephen Miles\xa0explains how leaders can elevate growth by fostering “idea conflict” – pushing hard on the idea, not the person – and creating a space where different voices can challenge one another to advance their thinking. | Private equity firms want the best management teams in place when they purchase companies. If your company is being evaluated by a PE firm, what do you need to be prepared for when it comes to your job? Where can you bring value to the company under its new ownership? Courtney Hamilton and Billy Stern discuss talent assessment in a private equity takeover and how employees can position themselves as the right talent to drive investor goals and growth. | Meetings are the most expensive use of company resources, yet they are still too long, poorly organized, and a waste of everyone’s time. But they don’t have to be.\xa0Stephen Miles describes what’s necessary to make meetings productive, efficient, and on-topic. | Working for a tough boss doesn’t mean that you are powerless in your job, says Taylor Griffin. There are strategies for adapting to a range of challenging leadership styles – from finding information elsewhere in the organization when a boss is uncommunicative to diffusing heated conversations with a boss prone to anger. Griffin explains ways to be effective in your role even in difficult situations and how working for a demanding boss can be one of the most valuable experiences of your career. | When new owners take over your organization, how do you protect your job? As five consecutive years of acquisition top $3 trillion and robust private equity markets continue to chase company investments, the reality of M&A today makes changes in management inevitable. Courtney Hamilton explains the best ways to prepare yourself for company takeovers and how to arm yourself with vital information about the company and its new leadership. | For some companies, success can be dangerous: a “stasis mindset” can take root, with a complacent “we know best” attitude capable of bringing down even the highest-performing companies. Stephen Miles explains that the best leaders actively fight off this mentality by embracing a “growth mindset” – they seek out new challenges and learn new ways of thinking by looking beyond what they already know. He discusses how both individuals and organizations cultivate this critical leadership mindset. | Boom or bust, the smartest CEOs put plans in place well before the next downturn arrives, says Stephen Miles. Without scenario planning and taking steps toward “recession inoculation” during periods of growth, leaders can be caught by surprise when the economy turns, forcing them to make decisions with less time and thought. Miles discusses how CEOs are planning with their top teams and speaking with their boards and investors about how to weather the next recession. | What are the secrets of the top performers in business?

Spauilding. His ideas are also distinctive as they reflect some form of ‘African management’ principles, the most salient being the emphasis on cooperation, echoing the African idea on cooperation (Ubuntu) and doing business also for the good of communities. The latter was important as African-Americans were/are a particularly vulnerable and discriminated minority. Spaulding also evoked a religious or spiritual dimension in his work, and some of his practices mirrored those exercised in African-American churches. Thus, one can attribute to him the practice of workplace spirituality before this concept was adopted in contemporary works. Spaulding’s work also displayed social entrepreneurship, which echoes the work of contemporary researchers like Dr. Nevena Radoynovska on how entrepreneurship can play a vital role in vulnerable populations.Joining us for this episode are two scholars of African-American Management History — Leon Prieto of Clayton State University and Simone Phipps of Middle Georgia State University. | In this episode, we acknowledge the extraordinary contributions of Charles Clinton Spaulding, an important management thought leader who, like many African-Americans prior to the U.S. civil rights movement, has been sadly overlooked in the management canon. From 1923 until 1952, Spaulding served as the President of the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, the largest company in the U.S. owned exclusively by African-Americans, with over $40 million in assets at the time of his death.Joining us for this episode are two scholars of African-American Management History — Leon Prieto of Clayton State University and Simone Phipps of Middle Georgia State University. Together, they authored a 2016 paper that the Academy of Management called groundbreaking, “Rediscovering Charles Clinton Spaulding’s ‘The Administration of Big Business’: Insight into early 20th Century African-American Management Thought,” and have authored several other papers bringing important attention to Spaulding and other African-American management leaders whose works deserve much wider attention! | Join us, and Prof. Stephen Cummings, for Part 2 of this discussion on Lewin\'s classic article. Many working in the change management arena–scholars and practitioners alike–have likely heard of Kurt Lewin’s three main phases of organizational change: (1) unfreezing, (2) moving, and (3) freezing (also commonly referred to as re-freezing). And indeed, Kurt Lewin presented those phases in his 1947 article “Frontiers in group dynamics: Concept, method and reality in social science; social equilibria and social change.” But as explained by our special guest Stephen Cummings from the University of Wellington, New Zealand, this three-phased approach was not actually an important finding or outcome of the article. Without offering any empirical support or developing much detail into the phases, Lewin was simply offering ideas for further exploration. Yet these phases have been adapted into numerous change management models available in business literature. | In this episode, we are joined by Prof. Stephen Cummings (New History of Management) to address one of the foundational works in social psychology and organizational development - “Frontiers in group dynamics: Concept, method and reality in social science; social equilibria and social change”. This was the first of two articles that Kurt Lewin published in the newly established journal Human Relations with the Tavistock Institute. In the article, Lewin makes a strong case for treating the social sciences on the same level with the natural sciences–previously, social science was considered neither rigorous nor valid. Using metaphors from physics, Lewin explains social phenomena in tangible, physical terms through constructs such as “force fields.” In doing so, he explained how individuals within a social space interact in ways that could be measured similarly to physical or chemical phenomenon. And he did so using the results of studies on rather ordinary, mundane phenonena such as training on stitching machines and the crossed interactions between a husband and wife. | In Part 2 of the episode we look at how much has changed in organizations from 1980s to the present day. To what extent do Hofstede’s six factors still hold up? How salient is his model of socializing cultures between societies (“nations”) and organizations? To what extent is the construct of organizational culture being misused, such as suggested in our Episode 49 where we explored Gideon Kunda’s study of “tech culture?” Are there dangers to conflating organizational culture with climate? | Fresh off a study that identified key factors for comparing national cultures, organizational psychologist Geert Hofstede and his team set off to determine whether similar constructs could be deduced for organizational cultures. The success of this research is detailed in Hofstede\'s classic 1990 paper, "Measuring Organizational Cultures: A Qualitative and Quantitative Study Across Twenty Cases," published in Administrative Science Quarterly. Through surveys and interviews among members of twenty units within ten large organizations, Hofstede\'s team proposed six distinct determinants of organizational culture that could be compared and contrasted across all organizations.Please also join us in welcoming 2 new podcast hosts - Jarryd and Frithjof! | Tune in for Part 2 of our discussion of Charlie Chaplin\'s classic film - Modern Times. What does the film have to say about such contemporary topics as gig economy, gender in the workplace and emotional labour? Join us to find out! | Routinely ranked as one of the greatest movies of all time, Charlie Chaplin’s 1936 film “Modern Times” balances great physical comedy with powerful social commentary. Playing his famed “Tramp” role for the final time, Chaplin portrayed a hapless Worker on an assembly line who is tormented both by supervisors and the work itself. After being subjected to a humiliating experiment intended to improve the line’s efficiency, the Worker runs through a series of rotating jobs, stints in jail, and other misadventures as he tries to find his purpose in life.He eventually finds his purpose through a growing relationship with the Gamine (Paulette Goddard), a tragic young woman orphaned after a worker’s strike turns violent and kills her father. She escapes becoming a ward of the state but resorts to stealing to survive until caught by the police. After the Worker sacrifices himself to save them, the two would become inseparable. Seeing a happy couple in a well-to-do, they imagine themselves being happy and carefree living together in a rundown falling-apart shack. But in the end, she cannot hide from her past as an escaped orphan. Destitute and alone, the two find themselves on a barren road — she appears to have given up on life, but the Worker convinces her to continue on and try again. They leave, walking down the road to who knows where?As we viewed the film, our initial thoughts were about how Taylorism is portrayed and critiqued through the scenes at the factory and the social turmoil going on outside. But the film actually touches on many of the themes of this podcast. Referenced throughout the episode were Taylor (Episode 1), Maslow (Episode 3), Max Weber’s Bureaucracy (Episode 6), The Hawthorne Studies (Episode 9), Banana Time (Episode 13), Suchman’s Human-Computer Interactions (Episode 22), the Gig Economy (Episodes 36 & 40), Socialization a la Van Maanen (Episode 38), the Garbage Can Model of Decisionmaking (Episode 39), and Kunda’s Study of Tech Culture (Episode 49).Listen as we discuss this fantastic and powerful film whose insights on work and society are still relevant today! | Please join us as we conclude discussing Rosemary Stewart\'s classic work on management in practice.

Usually we record from different countries on Skype, but it’s quite fun and very appropriate to do things differently today.\xa0\xa0 This podcast is brought to you by Virtual Not Distant, a London-based consultancy helping organisations transition to successful office-optional working. What’s going on? Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker recently unveiled an $18 billion transportation investment bill that includes a tax credit that will give companies more flexibility in offering work from home perks to their employees -  more on LinkedIn here. Employers are not supporting tech learning, at least not as much as their employees would like. This UK research in  People Management was disappointing to read. The reasons why are not clear, but the expressed frustration certainly is. Leaving people to figure things out for themselves is NOT the way to implement effective digital transformation!  WeWork have cancelled - sorry, postponed - their forthcoming IPO Pilar and Maya don’t really get it, the corporate co-working movement and replicating the office you’ve left behind, but clearly some people love it… Not enough to fundamentally shift the problems of office space costs, but maybe it’s good to remind us of the many different options in terms of co-working alone.  Work From Home Week - listen to Rebecca Corliss, VP of Marketing at Owl Labs, recapping on this interesting initiative they promoted in July, encouraging corporate partners to experiment systematically with home working.\xa0 It’s great to learn more about their ‘Meeting Owl’ product as well, a 365 degree conferencing camera that puts the remote participants in the centre of the hybrid meeting, instead of stuck up on the wall somewhere. Work From Home Week was a great experiment which taught participants a great deal, and the blog post shares these fascinating insights.\xa0 “#WFHW” will be repeated, but you don’t have to wait : Why not have your own ‘work from home week’ within your organisation? BBC Bitesize have been writing about ‘workplace perks’, and we all went ‘ahhh’ about the concept of ‘Fur-ternity’ leave - offering new pet-parents the option of working from home for a week while settling a new non-human family member. Anything that brings on experimenting with remote working is fine by us, as is any embrace of the diversity and individuality of human motivation. Pilar has been a panelist this week for a  Minds at Work event, which was run as a hybrid event in London plus a parallel remote one, while the two cohorts were kept completely separate.\xa0 The remote side used Remo, a new tool for remote events, which worked very well - offering lots of flexibility for participants to ‘choose a table’ and talk to each other, then listen to broadcasts in bigger sessions. Event sessions included finding your community at work, and how that differs in the remote space (do people still meet their best friends or their life partners at work?), as well as the ways we communicate and changing degrees of formality and the evolution of the business conversation generally.\xa0 So many shifts, and the question of how to make remote work better are often questions about how to make work better generally… this event and others are really helping to broaden the conversation, and if you get the chance to participate in one in future, why not check it out? You can do so from anywhere in the world, for example somewhere like Maya’s home office - which she has recently reclaimed from a shared space, banishing her other half to his own home office in another room! She has added a comfortable arm chair for reading and research, and also a standing desk zone (though the way this is being used as a bookshelf reveals that not a lot of standing up takes place every day) - at least the theory is there, and it’s good not to sit too much!\xa0 Also to change your focal point, by looking at something further away than the screen in front of your nose. A work in progress, Maya is doing her best to organise the space - small as it is - by function, to create different zones for different activities, which is a powerful way to overcome any feeling of being “stuck in one place” all day, as well as switching up the energy: Pilar does a similar thing moving around her apartment, and both enjoy getting out of the home office and interacting with other people in the neighbourhood too. And how about if more employers encouraged people to do things in their community, safeguarded the time needed to take a class or do some exercise? Surely everyone’s health AND productivity would improve.\xa0 But you can always find ways to connect when remote working, such as apps like FocusMate - which pairs you with an accountability partner to work alongside\xa0 remotely via webcam. Anything which helps you get things done is worth a try, though some people might find it distracting or want to talk to the other person and get to know them - which is the opposite of the whole idea. We would love to hear your thoughts about working from home - which is just one aspect of remote working and wholly optional one. Let us know what you thought of this episode, what you think of working from home, and what you’d like us to explore and discuss next. Send us your comments, or catch up on Twitter to join the conversation.  | In this episode, we hear from how different people are going about growing their companies. They have different customers, different recruitment processes and different ideas about the size and make up of their workforce. However, they have one thing in common: their employees are distributed over different geographical locations.

Our guests explain why they started to employ people at Zapier and Simple Tiger. 29.40mins. Pilar explains the nature of employment at Virtual not Distant; Wade explains how they recruit at Zapier; Jeremiah talks about his own process when looking for other people to hire; while third guest Tim Burgess takes on a different strategy when looking for employees for Shield GEO.\u2028 \u2028 43.40mins. So far, hiring for remote seems very similar to hiring for colocated. However, there is one thing that makes a huge difference when you’re growing a remote company: Timezone differences. Tim and Wade discuss their thoughts and experiences around hiring globally and asynchronous (and text-based) communication specifically. 54.00mins. Hiring globally means that you can grow and grow and grow and grow… but that’s not on everyone’s mind. | Today we have such a detailed episode for you, that we’ve had to split it into two, for practical distribution reasons. This is part two of two These shownotes for both episodes are available at\xa0  http://virtualnotdistant.com/podcasts/collaboration-dangers) -because it really is just one big conversation. Collaboration platforms - the dangers Too much information, vs “fear of missing out”? How do we stay on top of all the messages in our platforms, making sure we don’t get overloaded, while not missing anything vital? What if you get back from a holiday or an illness and there are 400 alerts…? Your team agreement needs to specify what to check, as opposed to what you can let go, or the best way to catch up on the conversation after a break. And your team agreement needs regular review to ensure relevance and that it’s continuing to serve you well.\xa0 Your team changes, and so does the tool (for example you might want to consider the appropriateness of animated emoji use, non-trivial for any users with dyslexia, or whether our emoji-sets are too culturally exclusive anyway). \xa0 Too much text Some of us type better than others do, and might also need to get comfortable with a speed vs accuracy tradeoff.\xa0 Remember you can dictate, you can record audio, you can record video.\xa0 You can use photos, of drawings or even handwriting. Draw your own emojis!\xa0 While we can’t customise the platforms themselves, and how they look and feel, but our culture and team personality can really emerge quite creatively. But, if it’s an important communication which might need to be referred back to or found in search, then text - which can be dictated text - is the only thing really searchable/indexable, for now (soon the AIs will be able to search our audio for keywords easily). So do consider that when choosing how best to post. Episode 153 should we be talking or typing goes into more detail on this. \xa0 Always on We need to choose a collaboration platform with good mobile tools, but we do need to remember to ensure those boundaries between work and non-work.\xa0 When your collaboration tool is there on the homescreen of your personal mobile phone, you’re never away from it. Richard Mackinnon discussed on a recent Work Life Psych podcast ‘my phone, where’s my phone!’, how truly addicted to our devices we are.\xa0\xa0 And sometimes we are left anxiously waiting for responses, in the same way as we crave our Facebook likes - is this person confused, annoyed, or just responding asynchronously when it suits them best?\xa0 The reward-centres of the brain that overthink these things have made the social networks billions, but do we want this effect in our work communications? Managing hostility This article from Workable about  hostile work environment signs and fixes led us to think about how signs of bullying, harassment or oppression become visible (or not) in the online workspace, and an interesting  Twitter thread emerged as a result.\xa0\xa0 Conflict at work might be less obvious to others, but conversely it is easier to provide evidence of when communications are digitised. There are lots of issues here about whether this is done ‘officially’ or not - this article from People Management,  Do you know what your employees are saying in private messages? discusses this in depth from a policy point of view, but everyone should remember that nothing in the digital space is truly secret. It’s important that everyone knows how to discuss difficulties and with whom, and that people get to know their online colleagues as whole people and develop their own support networks.\xa0 And while there are apps which can help highlight inappropriate communications, (such as the one described here in Venture Beat  Valued raises $1.7 million for Slack chatbot to combat workplace harassment), there are dangers in abdicating any of these responsibilities for team wellbeing and safety, to a tool or app. So many issues to think about, when it comes to our collaboration platforms, whether we call them chats or digital hubs or our online offices… we need to use them well, use them right, because these ARE our workplaces now. We conclude this episode with a lovely anecdote about two very creative people communcating asynchronously, in an unusual setting… but you’ll have to listen to find this little gem, which reminds us just how many different ways there are to communicate. Don’t forget to keep communicating with us! About your collaboration platforms, or any other aspect of remote work.\xa0 You can message us directly, you can tweet Maya or Pilar or the Virtual Not Distant account at any time, to keep this conversation going - asynchronously of course. \xa0 | Today we have such a detailed episode for you, that we’ve had to split it into two, for practical distribution reasons. This is part one of two  These shownotes for both episodes are available at\xa0  http://virtualnotdistant.com/podcasts/collaboration-dangers) -because it really is just one big conversation What’s going on  Buffer are looking at the introversion question too - and how to make this work when virtual teams meet up in ‘real’ life  Ten reflections on Buffer\'s 10th team retreat. I am sure it helps if your CEO is introverted! But there are lots of good ideas in here for every team.  Santander brews up the first uk work cafe for small businesses - is it a cafe, is it a bank, is it a co-working? An incubator? We’re not sure, but we like the idea and look forward to seeing how it develops, the more flexibility the better chance of everyone finding their perfect work space locally, and these days banks need to do more to connect with their communities. Formatting in Trello - yes you can italicise... but not in the mobile app. Oh well! We all learn something new every day, and this was news to us. New MSTeams accessibility features, explained at Use Immersive Reader in Microsoft Teams \xa0 Shared by our friend from previous podcasts Chris Slemp (ep. 202 and others). Text is NOT the optimal communications mode for everyone, and it’s good to see platforms addressing this. We’re looking for more evidence-based research to support our work with remote teams - Pilar had a  shout-out on LinkedIn here with some fascinating replies. Can you add anything? Speaking of networking, Pilar is starting a face-to-face meetup group in West London, for people in the remote leadership space. No powerpoint or pitching, just coffee and in-depth conversation. Let us know if you’re interested and date (likely October) will be confirmed. And another upcoming event which might interest London area listeners, from Minds@Work LAB on the 17th September 2019, all about  Mentally Healthy Remote Working - so do check that out, Finally, don’t forget to let us know about any events you know about or are planning, that we can share with our community  \xa0 Collaboration platforms - how we’re using them now A truly 21st Century work-life phenomenon, it’s time to talk about the tools we use every day. It’s time to talk about ‘chat’ - whether you use Slack, MSTeams, Twist, or other more project-management based tools which also include the ongoing conversation that ties the whole work process together. Slack was one of the first truly built for business, rather than repurposing consumer tools like MSN messenger and Skype (which was a consumer tool at first, and now Skype for Business is being subsumed into MSTeams).\xa0\xa0 We enjoyed this paper about  How scientists use Slack, which demonstrated the versatility of it and how different types of workers can shape it to their own needs, from conversation to creation. Collaborating on a research paper with international colleagues is a great example of time-agnostic asynchronous remote work. They also use the reminders tool - and we didn’t know you could set reminders for other people. Very interesting! And there’s a subtle difference when an app asks or reminds people about something, rather than a colleague… Interesting too how tools like Slack are being used at an organisational level, with hundreds or sometimes thousands of users - requiring very different moderation and interaction approaches, and potential new challenges, and leading Slack to introduce new admin tools for professional users. We’d rather see team agreements and consensus, than controls - but perhaps with scale it’s becoming inevitable. So these tools are becoming multipurpose communications hubs, not always real-time chat - channels can become discussion forums, co-creation spaces, announcement channels and so on. And as we’re always saying, asynchronous conversation rocks! Our friends at Buffer experimented with turning Slack off altogether - Slack-off Fridays: What Happened When One Team Experienced a Day Without Slack - there are many other ways to do visible teamwork effectively. \xa0The use of the word chat (or instant messaging, from which these tools evolved) frustratingly suggests an instantaneous response. So we need a new collective noun. What shall we call them? Does “collaboration platforms” work? “Digital hubs”? Where we live and do our work online needs a better name, so please let us know what you think! Don\'t forget to continue to download and enjoy part two of this conversation next... | \xa0 >Today’s episode is a solo show, as Pilar was part of two conversations she wanted to share with you straight away. And she also took the opportunity to ask the community managers at Minds@Work to tell you about their next event.  The episode was prompted by a message that Pilar received from a friend of hers. His team is currently colocated, but some of the team members would like to go remote; plus he’s realising that the business might benefit from recruiting in other geographical areas. He’s wondering whether he should turn into a hybrid team, or a fully distributed one.  The benefits of being a hybrid team, within an organisation: \xa0   \xa0You have a presence in headquarters as a team.   Those staying in HQ can still have spontaneous interactions, which could be a point of connection for some team members. You might have a team member who acts as a connector, between remote and colocated; some people are really good at keeping everyone together, regardless.   A lot of communication is electronic anyway, so it might be easy to follow visible teamwork practices.   ">The Drawbacks:   Different visibility in the organisation between team members can cause friction, as some people might be missing out on networking and promotion opportunities, and other stuff going on in the organisation.   \xa0   Clusters might form (remote vs colocated) in an unhealthy way.   Feelings of inequality and isolation. People in the office could also feel isolated; if some members can go remote because they have a comfortable place at home, while others don’t, and so have no choice but to stay in HQ. And remote team members can easily feel like they’re being forgotten about.   Benefit of being fully distributed: Everyone’s in the same boat, which has lots of benefits. Downsides: \xa0   It could be expensive if the team has different overheads than the organisation: a coworking budget, new equipment, expenses which are difficult to explain in some organisations   More change to manage. A hybrid team can be more organic, but a fully remote team will need a lot of adapting to.   Team could lose visibility in the organisation, but you can develop a strategy to avoid this.   13.50 How should you have difficult conversations in a virtual team?\xa0 After a few Twitter interactions, here are those things you should consider when having a difficult conversation:  Do you and your team member feel comfortable with video, how do you best connect with the other person?   What role will emotions play? For example, is it important to see the other person’s emotions/reactions; or is the expectation that we don’t want others to see how we react?   What is the norm in your team? If you always use video, probably video is best. If audio is the norm, the audio might be best. Or you might want to suggest something different to elevate the importance of the conversation… (but which can make the other person more nervous…)   What are individual’s preference? You need to know yourself and your team members   Think about all this BEFORE you have to have a conversation. Be prepared. (Even share this episode with your team to kick off the conversation!) If you’ve never worked remotely or managed people virtually, go carefully through the advice you read or are given, there is no one way of doing this.\xa0  24.15 Hear about An Event about Mental Health in Remote Working April Doty and Sarah Bingham tell us about the Minds@Work event Minds@Work LAB on Mentally Healthy Remote Working will take place in London on 17 September 2019 6.30pm BST, and online. (It looks like Pilar will be joining a virtual panel there.)

If you would like to be involved in the podcast, fill in this form. | We have two interesting guests for you to meet today, and our first conversation is an excellent example of some of the things you might not obviously know about people when you work with them remotely, as we delve into some of the non-work things which make our associates into whole people. But we do talk about creativity, 21st century careers, and content marketing too and the way everything is evolving. We’re making lots of changes to our content at Virtual Not Distant - have you checked out the website lately?\xa0 Plenty of new things to see, we would love to hear what you think about all of it, and changes in the podcast too... including our new section: 03.49 What’s going on! This will be a regular round-up of news, events and issues in the remote space. Right now:  Pilar is discovering the joys of unplugging, and going properly ‘out of office’ - which you still need to do in remote. Just because you can stay in touch constantly, it doesn’t mean you have to, and stepping out of the conversation for a while brings many benefits. This  article from the BBC in July made the headlines for not having an office… and it turned out to be our friends from Automattic (see  episode 136). They’ve been around since 2005, but for the Beeb ‘Wake Up to Money’ programme this was big news! Good to see the mainstream catching up... A great  conversation on LinkedIn recently (in Italian, sorry!) spoke up for the potential of collaborative creativity in remote, delving into the difference between individual and group creativity in an interesting way - and they really understand the name of our organisation, which was highly gratifying. More on  sychronous/asynchronous collaboration, something we talk about a lot - here’s a thoughtful piece on creative ideation in remote, and another great take on this from  Buffer - lots to think about, but the main thing is that it’s possible Don’t forget to sign up for our newsletter - for a regularly monthly shot of inspiration and ideas And do send us YOUR ideas, about what’s going on in remote work!  \xa0 16.56 21st Century Work Life - with Luis Magalhaes It doesn’t get much more ‘21st Century’ than Luis Magalhaes’ CV, where his portfolio of roles includes marketing, podcasting, dentistry and gaming… His main activity for the past couple of years though is being Director of Marketing and Editor In Chief at DistantJob. The company promotes remote work as a solution for companies who want to scale and grow, and they specialise in recruitment from a global marketplace. For businesses it means hiring the best person wherever they are located, and DistantJob deals with all the contractual and logistics complications which may arise from hiring outside of their own location and jurisdiction. Content marketing helps DistantJob target their sweet spot of medium-sized businesses - ready to hire, but not to open international branches - and they test and iterate and keep doing more of the things that work. They develop their content strategy collectively and transparently as a team, and constantly review their own practice and thinking, based on the people they talk to. Everything they learn, and reflects their values and culture in hiring - hiring for themselves and their clients. DistantJob create 3 pieces of quality original content each week, two articles and a podcast, and it works. Inbound marketing is the ‘karma based economy’: provide valuable information, and people will come to you when they need what you’ve got to offer.\xa0 Luis rarely practices dentistry these days, but always loved the intersection of science, medicine and diagnostics - and his evident passion for helping people clearly has parallels here. He also enjoys the synergy of using his hands and brain together, to make things better. Helping people find the best job of their lives has more in common than we might have thought, with fixing their toothache. Luis also loves videogames, and attributes much to that passion, from writing and creativity, to co-ordination, even the spatial awareness needed for dentistry. He podcasts and writes about gaming from time to time, to try and offset the bad rap they get in popular discourse. He writes fantasy fiction too (and is a best seller in Portuguese, while also releasing his new novel The Silvery Moon this summer in English).\xa0 Amazing insights were generated in this conversation with Luis, and reflected and expanded upon by Pilar, about the impact of language and bilingualism on creativity. We should bear in mind the impact of this in our global teams, and remember that real time video might not always be ‘the best’ - remember Allon Shevat’s comments in  our last episode. Check out Luis’\xa0podcast at Distant Job (on which both  Pilar and Maya have guested), and check out their blog too. Luis tweets as well. And talking of content and creation, here’s further insight about SEO and how content gets found in the first place... \xa0 59.01 Jeremiah Smith founder and CEO of SimpleTiger A specialist in SEO for software-as-a-service companies, Jeremiah has seen 2 decades of trends in search engine optimisation, which is now being transformed by more intelligence: AI is superceding traditional algorithms, and handling content very differently. This trend will deepen, and search will get ever more prescriptive, as we provide constant feedback on its success.\xa0 And Jeremiah reminds us that search does not just mean Google - Amazon is one of the world’s biggest search engines, for example, just specialised in products. Creating authentic and high quality content which creates a good user experience throughout the customer journey, should continue to be rewarded by search traffic - whether you’re an SME startup or a Fortune 500 company. Keep up with Jeremiah on Twitter for further thoughts. --- What do you think about quality content and conversation in remote work? Do you have a view you’d like to share, on this or any aspect of 21st century work life? We now have a  podcast guest application form, and really welcome your ideas and contributions for the show   | Maya and Pilar have always enjoyed discussing a range of conversations and ideas about remote work and collaboration, but it’s great that we’re increasingly noticing more fragmentation and variation in the public discourse around this subject.\xa0 The opening up of niche communities and content in the remote world is encouraging us to transition this podcast towards a tighter focus on remote / virtual /distributed teamwork as the conversation proliferates, and gives us more to dig down into and discover with each episode. We love to hear what you think, via our contact form, and also on Twitter (@Virtualteamw0rk) At Virtual Not Distant we are all about a deep understanding of the world of remote and how to make it work well. Experimentation is good, but oversimplification is not - and can lead to quickly concluding that ‘remote didn’t work for us’, a lose-lose outcome. So many variables, not least between companies which start as distributed teams versus those who transition to a more office-optional situation further down the line, and also the increasing number of employees who are now working remotely - whether at home or in a co-working - alongside the typical/traditional freelancers and entrepreneurs. This one is interesting because small and new organisations encourage and recruit for flexibility and less predictability, the wearing of multiple ‘hats’ at work… whereas traditional employees might be less autonomous and need more support. Though not everybody agrees with us!\xa0 Maybe for a chaotic startup, a fixed office space can create the only stability to focus on. And we can personalise that space and make it our ‘home’, which is very important for some people. (have a look at the first chapter of “Thinking Remote” for more reflections on the digital vs physical workspace). And developers, why not think about giving us more customisation options in our platforms and hubs, so we can make our digital offices feel like our very own? Another issue is the relationship between remote work and flexible work, and whether remote work means complete flexibility to work and deliver at the best time and place to suit each person… or do we expect people to be working fixed hours, contactable at specific times? In what other ways can we make the work itself more autonomous, while still being accountable and connected, and how much of this is about managerial expectations as opposed to deliverables and outcomes? 21.30 "Advice" on remote culture... An article we encountered on social media recently made Pilar’s heart sink… We don’t often rip apart articles on this podcast (not since  episode 126!), but every now and then you do feel you have to respond. It’s called “How to build a strong company culture with a remote team” - but there was really nothing in the article about culture.\xa0 In fact just as in an event Pilar recently attended, there was an equating of culture with banter and chat, and no correlation of the idea of culture with values or guiding decision-making, perception… Which is a reminder that culture is not something people (outside of our geeky change-management space perhaps) really talk or think about. Culture is not easy to change, it’s often deeply ingrained and internalised, and it’s much easier to focus on behaviour and changing that instead. But there was a lot to take on in this article. It really felt like the writer had little direct experience of remote teamwork and felt insecure about being able to manage work at a distance. And apparently remote teams need to ‘let their hair down’. Oh dear. Enough said. A sub-heading in the list (of course, it was a listicle) referenced online “meetings” - complete with the quotation marks, making Maya cringe. Their advice was to use ‘videoconferencing’ - a thing we were talking about a decade ago, so go and get your suit and tie on first. Perhaps this does remind us all that we are still struggling with consistent vocabulary as it evolves in the remote space. What do you call it when you just want to hop on a quick video call with someone in your team? We’d love to know. Another tip from the Telegraph article suggested you “set rules about the tech you use” - OK, so far as it goes. But nothing about how you use the tech was mentioned, and the very term “rules” suggests a different approach to a team agreement, the idea of building a consensus around how we want to communicate and why. A further confusion between social media and team communications was a bit strange too, and while boundaries are more blurred now between internal and external communications, the distinctions between the two are still critical. Finally though, one assertion in the article had Pilar and May both raging at their screens. Apparently, “introverts struggle more with remote working”.\xa0 Introverts “find it harder to initiate conversation” - well, that was bound to press the buttons of two introverted writers/consultants/podcasters who also happen to be professional communicators and remote work advocates. And it betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of what the introversion/extroversion spectrum actually is.\xa0\xa0 People who score highly on introversion scales re-energise in private, as opposed to gaining energy from the company of others - while introverts thrive on the company of others for stimulation and energy.\xa0 There is zero correlation either way with communication skills. Remote working enables people to control their environmental preferences, whether that means creating peaceful space for deep working, or enjoying the bustle of a busy co-working. But introverts are not shy, reserved, or suffering from a communication skills impairment. 45.06 Is it introversion, or a cross-cultural assumption? To explore introversion and its implications in more depth, Pilar spoke to Allon Shevat, who shed some interesting light on the issue by reminding us that behaviour perceived as introvert could be something very different, depending on the cultural backgrounds involved. For example a question from a business superior might be seen in Western culture as expecting an immediate response - but in Japanese culture, thoughtfulness would be valued more highly than immediacy, and a considered answer a delivered little later more appreciated. Another colleague might be reluctant to give a negative answer in some circumstances, and prefer to respond privately if the news is bad - a sign of respect and courtesy, over the transparency of sharing bad news publicly which could reflect on the manager or the whole team. (Maya has also had experience of this when working with developers and contractors from the Indian subcontinent, who seemed incapable of expressing anything like, “no, this work is not going ok” or “nope, that cannot be done”, when that was exactly what needed saying...) Silence or a lack of response also has cultural implications, and can be a way of expressing lack of agreement rather than shyness or introversion. Dissent could also be indicated via a backchannel or indirect communication, in cultures where it simply wouldn’t be acceptable to express a negative opinion about a colleague.\xa0 Finally Allon reminds us that on international teams, delayed or written responses can simply reflect use of a second language, rather than anything relating to introversion/extroversion, and can lead to disadvantage in synchronous calls or chats. If you want to learn more follow @AllonShevat on Twitter (and he is the secret mastermind behind another twitter account we also enjoy - but you’ll have to listen to find out which one!) We discussed many issues surrounding cultural differences in  Episode 201 with Theresa Sigillito Hollema and Surinder Kahai if you want more on this fascinating area, and also back in  episode 138 with Nancy Settle-Murphy.\xa0\xa0 All of this reflects the fact that so much more is now going on in the remote workspace conversation - we’ll be digging into the ongoing issue about  hostility in the workplace soon as it applies to remote, and other deep-dives into other burning issues are also coming your way. Please tell us if there’s something specific you’d like us to research and explore. For now, thank you very much for listening! | Welcome to episode 202 of the 21st Century Work Life podcast from Virtual Not Distant, where today we’re revisiting the roles of tech - particularly chat-based platforms - in teams, and the relationship between tech and strategy… Interestingly much of which also applies nowadays within organisations we don’t think of as ‘remote’, and depends a great deal on how we agree to use the tools at our disposal (including our expectations regarding speed of reply) Don’t forget to come and say hello to us on Twitter, @VirtualTeamW0rk and @PilarOrti… we love to talk to our listeners, and we talk about all sorts of interesting things, like a new feature in MSTeams which  Pilar had a strong reaction to… Maybe there are some situations where text is better than a call, even when it’s urgent? Do join in and tell us what you think.\xa0 And please bear with us as our website is being updated, we’re bringing you a refreshed look and feel and some great new content - in particular look out for more about our self-paced learning programme to accompany the Thinking Remote book, if you’re serious about improving your remote leadership practice. 21st Century Work Life: Chris Slemp, Customer Success Manager at Microsoft Today’s guest Chris actually introduced us to one of our favourite phrases, ‘Office-Optional’, so it was great to talk to him for the third time on our podcast.\xa0 Moving from a small consultancy to Microsoft gave Chris and his wife a chance to relocate to Scotland, and his work involves helping people to be more productive with the tools they already own. To support customers they use a blend of face to face visits but also online, and of course they use Microsoft Teams. Clients include organisations like police forces and local councils and other workplaces we might not think of as ‘remote’, but actually involve people in many locations, including many non-office situations, and reminding us that it’s not only knowledge workers who can benefit from these tools. The work is not location-dependent, so the communication should not be. From a customer support point of view, it’s essential to understand and relate to roles outside of the IT dept, even if that’s the first point of contact. Technology needs to be a partner, not a supplier, to realise its potential these days, and help businesses solve their problems effectively. We should be driven by the need, not by the tech. Even within their own team they had to evolve the way they used their own tools effectively, and improving meant an ongoing blend of coaching individuals and moderating and managing the conversation itself. Perhaps the problem is that the tools now look and feel so similar to those we use in our personal lives, where we’re used to pleasing ourselves what we do with them, and we really need a team agreement or a ‘collaboration constitution’ to nail down the way we’re going to do things. In a flattened organisation, tools enable visibility which enhances influence. Different communications styles may be advantaged by different modes, and we need to learn new ways of engaging effectively. TL;DR - the person posting the right gif might get more engagement than the one with the long insightful text. Teams need different kinds of social glue, and the asynchronous space is still overly text-heavy, to its detriment. MSTeams is bringing functionality to record and stream voice calls and meetings, which creates automatic transcripts and even translations - AI is making this doable with increasing accuracy, and it means that audio becomes searchable on a par with text. The future role of AI is a fascinating area, and at Microsoft they are talking deeply about the ethics as well as the enablement it can bring. Intentionality solves a lot of problems, as machine learning frees up a lot of time from administrative tasks, and might help us avoid repeating the mistakes already made in social media. But what about areas like sentiment analysis? Yammer is looking into this functionality, as well as a bot to recognise and respond to FAQs, for everyone who would rather ask than search. Have a look at Chris’ site http://whichtoolwhen.com/ for more insight, into this and other ongoingly essentials questions. And keep up with Chris on Twitter to join the conversation. \xa0 48.08 Tools: Otter.ai Maya and Pilar talk about text into speech, using this AI-driven tool, which also works well with multiple voices too.\xa0\xa0 Instead of detailed notes on this segment, here’s the full  transcript of our conversation instead, courtesy of Otter! And a brief after-word: We did some research about the privacy angles of using Otter and similar apps…  Here’s one take on it from Zdnet which was unsurprising, and the main thing is that you need to read the small print and make your own mind up, whether use of any given tool is inline with your objectives and stated policies as an organisation. This does also remind us why many organisations are choosing to keep their entire digital workspace within a single ecosystem.\xa0 This is an important issue to which we shall doubtless return. 54:00 Wellbeing: Transitioning to remote as a journey of discovery At Virtual Not Distant we see this transition as an opportunity to dissect and discuss our teamwork, the ways we interact and work together - has this evolved unconsciously, or is this what we want to be doing? Have we got the courage to really examine this, and make bigger changes if we need to? This is much bigger than which tool we use and how, and we should be scrutinising this on a regular basis, not just when things go wrong. What do we each value about each aspect of our work?\xa0 It’s easy to assume others think like we do, and for both physical and digital workspaces to reflect the preferences of a minority. You can’t really enter into this discussion without some self reflection on what helps YOU do your own best work. If you are very specific and clear about what you do and don’t like, what you value and enjoy about your work, then you can think about how best to replicate this online. Transitioning to remote is a chance to reassess where we want to invest our energies and attention, as individuals and as a team.   | \xa0 A special episode today and, let’s be upfront about it: a promotional one.  Thinking Remote: inspiration for leaders of distributed teams is a book for those of you managing, leading, or championing your remote team, or transitioning, or considering transitioning to an office optional approach. The book is a collection of articles written by Pilar Orti and Maya Middlemiss giving an overview of different aspects of leading remote teams. And at the end of each chapter, there is a set of leadership reflections, which are questions to help you think through what you have read - or listened to, if you go for the audiobook - and help you take the next steps. The best way to support people at a distance, we believe, is by adopting a coaching mindset, and that is exactly what we\'ve done with this book.  And for some readers it has worked! If you want to read about how, I encourage you to read Teresa Douglas’ thorough review over at her site . She covers what she took from three of the chapters and ends with a sentence that we could only have dreamt of:  ‘Thinking Remote’ is a thoughtful, thought provoking work that belongs on the shelves of any leader who manages office optional workers.  The chapter included in this episode was written by Maya, and if you want to listen to a bit more before you buy (or if actually two chapters will do you nicely) then check out the sample of the book on any of the audio retailers, as that is the chapter on Psychological Safety, which was originally written for Online Meetings that Matter - which is taking me so long, but hopefully will come out this October - and will include that chapter again, I have to admit. The book is available on Audible, through your subscription, also in Amazon to purchase, iTunes and other audiobook distributors; and it\'s really not pricey, it\'s going to take us ages to make the production money back - also, check out your local library, because we\'ve also done our best to distribute it to them.  05.14 mins “Is Work Causing You Stress? Going remote is not a magic pill,” from the section of the book on Remote Wellbeing. 15.32 mins if you’ve enjoyed that and fancy 12 chapters more, check out the different book formats here. As mentioned earlier, seeing as we’re here in a promotional episode for Virtual not Distant, Pilar will talk about who we work with. Maybe we could work with you… We work with curious professionals - this is very important to us, because we’re not the kind of company that likes telling others what to do - we prefer to help them discover what they should be doing. So, we need to work with people who are curious. We focus on helping managers of remote teams - virtual teams, distributed, dispersed, and also hybrid teams, those where some people are colocated (in the same space) and others not. And we look to help those who are transitioning to remote, or as we say, in not the sexiest of ways, but we can’t find another term - office optional. And interestingly, in the next podcast episode you will hear from the person who we stole that term from, Chris Slemp. We help to introduce remote teamwork practices, we help managers adapt their leadership styles to the remote space, in a number of ways. First off, for you the individual, we have loads of inspirational stuff for you to read or listen to here on our website - and we’re now creating some online courses and we’re going to build that little online academy slowly. And we’ll continue publishing books, blog posts, podcast episodes and we have a monthly mini-publication which maybe you’d like to sign up to. We also have coaching services available if you are a manager of a remote team and would like some one-one professional development. Furthermore we help organisations by working closely with HR and Leadership and Development, or the training department. And there we can deliver in person workshops, online workshops too, we can do a little bit of handholding through consultancy, but always adopting a facilitative style. We bring our knowledge - we have some in this very fast evolving space - to help you find out what the best way forward will be that will fit your culture, your set up, and the plans of your organisation - both at a developmental level and a strategic one. We can also facilitate team discussion that leads to a team plan on you will work when you’re not all in the office together at the same time. We’re also investigating how podcasting, or the creation of audio can help team members feel closer together, and also how it can create a sense of belonging in organisations - so if that’s of interest to you, get in touch. Thank you very much for reading and listening - wherever you are whatever you’re doing , enjoy. | Today we’re going global! With two great guests, collaborating remotely between the Netherlands and New York. Don’t forget to check out everything we do, over at the Virtual Not Distant website (including our new podcast guest submission form, and new formats in which Thinking Remote is available). Thank you for all the feedback on our milestone celebration episode all about celebrations! Shout-out to Jeremy and everyone in our community who commented and chatted and twittered about this one, we are so glad that this topic resonated (and we have a related  blog post on celebrations ready for you now too). 06.30 21st Century Work-life - Theresa Sigillito Hollema and Surinder Kahai Theresa is the Director of Interact Global, a Netherlands-based consultancy supporting multicultural virtual teams and the organisations they belong to, and no stranger to the 21st Century Work-Life podcast.\xa0 Surinder is a Professor at the Binghamton University, in upstate New York. They met through online discovery, Theresa was drawn to Surinder’s academic work on remote team leadership, and contacted him to propose writing together.\xa0 In his turn he was keen to see more non-academic dissemination of the growing body of research on virtual teams, and a lasting collaboration was born. The interview explores in detail their approach and the rhythms of communication that they developed, and how they learned about each other and their motivations and interests and built the shared purpose and trust needed to write together. They reflect on different styles of leadership and motivation they have both observed in the workplace, and which personal qualities are demanded of a good leader for virtual teams.\xa0 Theresa and Surinder agree that a transformational style of leadership combined with a genuine care and regard for the other yields the best balance for success, but that this is definitely more difficult to do at a distance. However, distance can be used to advantage to overlook superficial differences (such as appearance and race, as well as behaviours which can lead to conflicts), to focus on the vision for the work and what you truly have in common.\xa0 It’s surely time we started to talk more about the advantages which come from not being together, advantages for the team and the work, not just the preferences of the individuals involved.\xa0 But leaders can struggle to understand and care, especially on globally distributed teams. Caring from a distance is harder, but it must be role modelled by the leader. As Surinder says, "I\'m a key believer in relationships as productivity". \xa0 33.57 Tools: everytimezone.com There are many websites which help us work out timezones, but Every Timezone is a nice visual way of seeing different timezones in relation to each other on a map and slider, so that you can really picture them clearly in terms of being ahead or behind each other. The paid version is great for remote teams particularly as you can put your team members into their timezones - and don’t have to worry about what the zone is called or whether or not they’re on daylight saving, you just know that ‘Alex Time’ is 2 hours ahead, or whatever. A nice touch, particularly if you are dispersed in different parts of the world, and you can update your location when travelling - where is Alex time this week? Ah yes, Alex Time is presently 4 hours offset. This version has meeting scheduling tools as well, letting you pick and choose who should be in your meeting and invite them - assuming its at a good time for them of course. \xa0 38.32 Wellbeing - Timezone stress Do we overlook the cognitive load, of taking account of timezones in our virtual teams?  Recent research from TinyPulse has examined this, and found that it does cause some stress. But a lot seems to depend on whether you have a ‘main’ timezone, relating to a headquarters or centre - which does suggest some kind of a hybrid set-up, in which those who are more than 3 hours away from that can indeed feel distant emotionally from their teammates.\xa0 And they might end up having to work hours which they find antisocial, indeed they can end up working extra hours to accommodate meetings and things which are outside of their typical day, - as  Human Made found in recent research, even the stress of scheduling can make things harder on the outliers in particular.\xa0 A day is only 24 hours long, so surely no-one should have to attend a meeting any more antisocial than 8am or 8pm, for example? It’s unsurprising that results from the TinyPulse research suggest that a truly distributed team with no central zone to organise around leads to better relationships for everyone, and remember that people can choose to work in any segment of their own local day.\xa0 Your team could also be over-reliant on synchronous communication anyway - remember what we learned from  Marcus Wermuth in episode 195 for inspiration here. But it’s vital not to cut off the flow of information from anybody, wherever they are located. Maybe we need to take a better look at what flexibility really can mean, and what each of us needs in order to do our best work in our best way.\xa0 What do YOU need?

Þar þurfti hún að eiga við ágenga erlenda kröfuhafa sem svifust einskis til að hafa upp á henni og ná fram sínum hagsmunum.Eva starfaði einnig um tíma sem sjálfstæður ráðgjafi þar til einn fremsti „hausaveiðari“ landsins gaf henni eftirminnileg ráð sem olli því að hún skipti um stefnu á sínum starfsferli.Í fyrri part viðtalsins ræddum við um sameiginlega reynslu okkar af viðskiptanámi í Bandaríkjunum og árin sem við unnum hjá Kaupþing fyrir hrun.

But a sizeable part of the profession hasn’t made that leap yet. \xa0 So Blake Oliver, co-host of the Cloud Accounting Podcast, joins us to assess where we’re at in the profession when it comes to cloud adoption, as well as what’s next from here. \xa0 To learn more, and for the complete show notes, visit blionline.org/blog. \xa0 Resources:  Read: Cloud Accounting Blog Listen: Cloud Accounting Podcast Twitter: twitter.com/BlakeTOliver Facebook: www.facebook.com/blake.t.oliver LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/blaketoliver/ Learn more at MACPA.org/future-learning   Future-Proof is a production of Crate Media | How do you transform your organization into a truly digital organization?\xa0 \xa0 It’s not as simple as it sounds. You can’t just about employ some digital technologies and think that you’ve made it. Doing digital and being digital are not the same things. Not even close. \xa0 So, we’re joined by Matt Loeb, principal of Optimal Performance Seekers and acting CEO of SECURE, who is simply one of the deepest thinkers about what it means to be digital in an increasingly digital world. Quite frankly, too many people get this stuff wrong, and Matt is here to point us in the right direction. \xa0 To learn more, and for the complete show notes, visit blionline.org/blog. \xa0 Resources:  LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/mattloeb/ Twitter: twitter.com/mattloeb digitalNow Conference: digitalnowconference.com  How to Win in a Winner-Take-All World by Neil Irwin Learn more at MACPA.org/future-learning   Future-Proof is a production of Crate Media | To know where you’re going, you have to have an understanding of – and an appreciation for –\xa0where you’ve been.\xa0 \xa0 Publisher and activist Marcus Garvey said, “A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots.” And Michael Crichton, the bestselling author of Jurassic Park and Westworld, said, “If you don’t know history, then you don’t know anything. You are a leaf that doesn’t know it is part of a tree.” \xa0 Why are our two favorite quotes about history also about trees? Who knows. But these quotes encapsulate what we’re going to be discussing on today’s episode: a glimpse back at a little-known but hugely important event in this nation’s history and the role that little-old Maryland played in that event. \xa0 Our guest, Chris Formant, is a businessman by trade – a former top executive of a multi-billion-dollar global business and now the CEO of a technology company – but more to the point for this episode, he’s the author of a riveting new book called Saving Washington: The Forgotten Story of the Maryland 400 and the Battle of Brooklyn. \xa0 It’s a piece of historical fiction; all of the events in the book actually happened, but they are told through the eyes of two fictional characters who give life to an event that most people know little or nothing about. And we can really learn a lot about history, and the present, through their eyes. \xa0 To learn more, and for the complete show notes, visit blionline.org/blog. \xa0 Resources:  ChrisFormant.com Read: Saving Washington: The Forgotten Story of the Maryland 400 and the Battle of Brooklyn Instagram: instagram.com/chrisformant Twitter: twitter.com/cmformant LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/christopherformant Learn more at MACPA.org/future-learning   Future-Proof is a production of Crate Media | We spend a lot of time on this show talking about future trends and technologies — things like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and automation\xa0– and, more importantly, what those things mean for the future of our profession. \xa0 But there are many other hard trends — a.k.a. future facts, a.k.a. things that we know are going to happen – that will have a huge impact on what we do. The topics aren’t always as sexy, sure, but they’re equally impactful, and if we want to get serious about becoming future-ready, we need to be talking about these things, too. \xa0 So, that brings us to the decidedly un-sexy world of regulation this week. It probably doesn’t excite you, but we have to talk about this stuff, as a profession, because it might have more of an impact on what we do going forward than anything that technology can throw our way. \xa0 Luckily, our guest, Russ Golden, is one of the best people to talk to about regulation in the accounting and finance world because Russ is the Chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, better known as FASB. \xa0 To learn more, and for the complete show notes, visit blionline.org/blog. \xa0 Resources:  Find out more about the FASB’s most recent initiatives at FASB.org LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/russellgolden Read:  “FASB Proposes Improvements Related to Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity” Learn more at MACPA.org/future-learning   Future-Proof is a production of Crate Media | Our guest today is Neil Irwin, who is the senior economic correspondent at the New York Times and the best-selling author of The Alchemists: Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire, about the global financial crisis and its aftermath. \xa0 And Irwin recently wrote a new book titled  How to Win in a Winner-Take-All World: The Definitive Guide to Adapting and Succeeding in High-Performance Careers.

That thing that’s stinking up the joint but that nobody wants to do anything about – or, more to the point, nobody knows what to do about it. \xa0 That dead moose is talent.\xa0 \xa0 How do you find it? How do you keep it? How do you set your organization apart from all the others out there so people want to work for you? \xa0 It’s a HUGE problem, and here’s why in three short words: One point five. \xa0 That’s the unemployment rate for accountants and auditors. One point five percent. The national average is 3.7 percent. That means it’s more than twice as hard for employers to find great employees than everyone else. \xa0 Welcome to reality, and reality continues to get more and more harsh. Ten thousand Baby Boomers reach retirement age every single day. That means one of two things: they’re retiring and they’re taking all of their wisdom and experience with them or they’re continuing to work, which means younger professionals have fewer opportunities to advance their careers, which means they’re more likely to look elsewhere for those opportunities. \xa0 So, from a people perspective, accounting and finance professionals are dealing with a lot these days, and it’s not getting any easier.\xa0 \xa0 So we sat down with Paul McDonald, Senior Executive Director at Robert Half, which specializes in the placement of professionals in the accounting and finance, technology, legal, creative, and administrative fields. Paul has more than 30 years in the recruiting field and he has advised thousands of company leaders and job seekers on how to hire and get hired. \xa0 To learn more, and for the complete show notes, visit blionline.org/blog. \xa0 Resources:  Learn more at RobertHalf.com Read:  “The Future of Work: Adapting to technological change” Read:  “How to Make the Accountant Unemployment Rate Work for You” Twitter: twitter.com/paulcmcdonald Learn more at MACPA.org/future-learning   Future-Proof is produced by Podcast Masters', 'chan_desc': "How should you future-proof your organization and your career in a complex and chaotic world?

My job this week is to connect the dots between some of the insights we got from our interviewees this month. This includes one common thread across interviews: banks have an underlying fear of the FinTechs popping up everywhere and eating market share. | This week, we speak with With Sebastien de Brouwer, Chief Policy Officer at the European Banking Federation, about where banking leaders should be focused when it comes to AI in banking. Sebastien discusses which areas of banking—customer experience, legal risk, positioning—banks might latch onto when allocating budget for AI. \xa0 | Our guest this week is Nishant Chandra, PhD and Senior Director of Data Products at Visa. Nishant speaks with us about how banks can pivot to play to their strengths in a future where the technology landscape is shifting under their feet. He uses some good examples from Apple and GE that can help banking leaders think through how their culture can change to make AI a positive and not a negative. | This week, we spoke to another of our research advisors: Lee Smallwood, COO of Markets and Securities for Citi North America. Lee speaks with us about the dynamics of AI talent: finding the right talent and growing the right talent. How can a bank attract the right young people, train the right people within their organization, and martial them to success with AI in the future? How does a bank compete with Google, Facebook, and other AI-focused giants for AI talent? We answer these questions in this week\'s interview. | This month we focus on strategic recommendations for AI in banking. We\'re bringing back our research advisors for our AI in Banking Vendor Scorecard and Capability Map report, and this week, we speak with Ian Wilson, former Head of AI at HSBC. Wilson shares some of his thoughts as to what bankers should be thinking about when it comes to AI. Specifically: 1. Why is all the investment and attention around AI focused on risk? 2. What banking leaders should do to prepare for when that emphasis shifts away from risk. | It\'s the final episode of our month-long series on AI for the customer experience in banking. This week, Emerj CEO Daniel Faggella breaks down the insights from this month\'s interviews and colors them with data from our AI in Banking Vendor Scorecard and Capability Map report. In this episode, Daniel draws a picture about what the data says about AI for customer-facing applications in banking and barriers to adoption for AI in customer service. | This week we\'re joined by Sasha Caskey, the CTO of Kasisto. Kasisto is the highest-rated conversational interface vendor in our AI in Banking Vendor Scorecard and Capability Map report. Caskey discusses the future of where conversational interfaces fit into banking, including the automation of repetitive tasks. She also talks about the challenges of personal assistance, and how the real revolution in terms of market share may not come from established banks, but entirely digital banks and entirely digital currencies. | This week, we speak with Sindhu Joseph, CEO at CogniCor. She drops a quote in this interview that I really love and that I think hits on this month\'s theme well: "People don\'t need banks. They need banking." Joseph discusses how banks will have to transform to meet consumer expectations that are set by big tech. She talks about how one could hypothetically build a bank for 10% of the cost that banks run on today, and what that means for large banks. Finally, Joseph talks about how the banking workforce will change in response to artificial intelligence. For more on how AI is transforming banking, download the Executive Summary Brief of our AI in Banking Vendor Landscape at Capability Map. | The theme for the entire month is AI for the customer experience in banking. In this episode, we speak with Yinglian Xie, CEO at Datavisor. Xie sheds light on how users will expect to have "zero-step" authentication, the "friction-free" future of banking. Xie paints a picture about how the experience consumers have with big tech (such as a Facebook app) can be transferred into banking. She gives a sense for how backend data can have a strong effect on how well banks can serve customers on the front end. Xie also talks about the value of new data sources as banks shift into the digital world. | We learned a lot about AI in risk-related banking functions, such as fraud, cybersecurity, compliance, and lending, in our AI in Banking Vendor Scorecard and Capability Map report. In this month\'s analyst deep dive, Emerj CEO Daniel Faggella discusses some of the insights garnered from the data in our report about why vendors selling products for risk-related functions have raised so much money and why AI is such a good fit for fraud and cybersecurity.', 'chan_desc': 'Stay ahead of the curve as artificial intelligence disrupts the banking sector.Discover the lessons learned from organizations like HSBC, Citigroup - learn business strategies from venture capitalists investing in AI banking applications - and see the future with AI banking innovators from Silicon Valley and around the world.Each week Emerj Founder Daniel Faggella interviews top experts to bring their best insights to our audience.This show is for banking leaders, consulting and IT services leaders, and any businessperson with an interest in the evolving world of AI in banking.Find more AI banking insights at www.emerj.com/banking', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/ef/83/c9/ef83c95c-1ace-1dfa-0fa3-df47b0412f7a/mza_15676321288797234473.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-07-01'}}

What was covered  Why Hal believes most CEOs have trouble asking questions and how to pivot from answer-centric to question-led leadership. How to be a better leader by asking the ‘different, better question’ and using the ‘power of the pause’. How Hal’s question-first process of reframing of challenges can help us discover the winning solution.  Key Takeaways and Learnings  Associational thinking: how observing, networking, and experimenting helps the world’s top leaders find novel solutions nobody has thought of before. Catalytic questions: why challenging our false assumptions of the world forces us to create new beliefs and act on our questions.

Chris is an Associate Professor of Psychology at Union College in New York and a Senior Investigator at Geisinger Health System.  Why Chris believes companies often fail the test of inattentional blindness during the product design phase. Why our attention is more limited than we think and how learning self-control can help us to take in more information. Why we overvalue confidence and how we can work to recognize and overcome our own cognitive biases.

His approach redefines unpredictability as opportunity, diversity as profit, and execution as strategy. | The current tides of the world have asked for more innovation among businesses to adapt to the fast-changing times.

Hakan Cakir is the Procurement Digitalization & Analytics Product Owner of Sourcing Solutions for Deutsche Telekom AG, one of the world's leading integrated telecommunications solutions with 178 million mobile customers, 28 million fixed lines and 20 million broadband users in 50 countries. DT is best known in the US for their T-Mobile brand.  The procurement steering team that Hakan works within has end-to-end responsibility for all group wide strategic procurement processes and systems including digitization and innovation roadmaps. Given the scope and scale of their project, they leveraged advocates across the company, a key decision that allowed them to harmonize their processes before implementing technology.  In this conversation, Hakan talks about:  Their future state vision for the source-to-contract process and how that informed technology decisions.  How his team emphasized usability and acceptance testing to improve the implementation process and maximize adoption rates.  Lessons learned from a broad global rollout that required change management training and communication.  How DT plans to move forward towards their primary goal of building a fully data-driven procurement function.  The role that emerging technologies such as chatbots may play in DT’s global procurement future in the future. | “How do I get from where I am today to where I would like to be?”  In the age of digital transformation, it goes without saying that change is on everyone’s mind. But despite all of the energy we are putting into thinking about change, we may or may not be seeing that change come to pass.  In this week’s podcast, host Philip Ideson speaks with Chris Sawchuck, Principal and Global Procurement Advisory Practice Leader at The Hackett Group. They recently released a new research report titled “World-Class Procurement: Redefining Performance in a Digital Era”.\xa0  In Chris’ experience, many procurement teams are looking for step-by-step guides for change that would be better led more organically, by a leader with a vision for proving procurements’ intrinsic value. One example is a question he is asked often: “How do we become a trusted advisor?” Rather than looking for details as to how, Chris instead characterizes the traits he sees most often in advisory procurement teams, not the least of which is balancing agility with consistency.\xa0  In this conversation, Chris shares his advice about:\xa0 ● Emerging technologies and how they are being incorporated into the existing procurement technology landscape by world-class organizations.\xa0 ● Avoiding a focus on lengthy, 200-page policy manuals that no one is going to read or follow. ● What he sees happening in the teams that successfully lead change from within, including investments in automation, education and execution. | “We have to be able to talk in a language that the business understands, and they have to see the actual value of what [procurement is] bringing to the table over and over, above any type of savings, I think that's the key for me.” In this week’s podcast, host Philip Ideson speaks with Mahmood Shah, Director of Global Procurement at MetLife. He started his career in supply chain in the automotive and airline industries before making the switch to procurement and financial services. He has also worked on both sides of the direct/indirect spend line. His experience and point of view are critical for any procurement organization weighing the benefits and challenges of full digital transformation. That doesn’t just mean taking the source-to-pay process online; it requires the leadership team to explore and employ the full advantages of bots and robotic process automation (RPA). In this conversation, Mahmood shares his advice about:  The importance of having a vision for procurement digitalization that includes more personalized capabilities and self-service options for distributed buyers, and what boundaries (if any) should confine what non-procurement colleagues have access to do. What he would do differently to market procurement within his organization if he had it to do over. How to evaluate, select and implement RPA solutions specifically for procurement applications. The kinds of changes further automation of procurement requires to the relationship between procurement and in-house IT.  | If we were to describe a CPO that was focused on emotional intelligence (EI) and self-empowerment, tranquility and self-possession, where would you guess he or she worked? Maybe at a lifestyle brand or a Silicon Valley startup. It would probably take you a few hundred guesses to come up with the National Basketball Association (NBA).\xa0 In this week’s podcast, host Philip Ideson interviews Joe Postiglione, CPO of the NBA, author and executive coach. True to our opening question, he is a certified empowerment coach and certified emotional intelligence coach. After leaving a supply chain-focused career in big consulting, he became an entrepreneurial executive coach. Now he supports all of the leagues that form the NBA. Despite working in a fast-paced environment that no doubt has more than its fair share of intensity, Joe stresses focus and living in the moment with his team – who he continues to support in a manner reminiscent of his coaching days. “Anyone can learn to live a more “self-empowered life,” Joe tells us. Based on all of his professional experiences, Joe paints an interesting picture of the self-limiting beliefs specific to procurement pros, including an inability to escape the thinking that led to a problematic situation in the first place and being preoccupied rather than present. Fortunately, the way out of that box is as simple as choosing to think differently. | In this episode, AOP Host Philip Ideson and Kelly Barner (AOP Content Director and Owner of Buyers Meeting Point) discuss their major take-aways from August’s news, industry topics and podcast interviews. In August, we split our time between active procurement practitioners and thought leaders. Dana Small, Global Category Manager at BioMarin Pharmaceutical, talked about her transition from finance to procurement (yes, on purpose) and shared how being a business blogger changes her perspective on her ‘day job’. Then Jason Cammorata, Vice President of Strategic Sourcing at MDC Partners, spoke about the qualities that make conflict “good” for an enterprise and the teams within it. On the thought leader side, Hélène Laffitte, Founder and CEO of Consulting Quest, provided insight into best practices for sourcing consulting services and Procurement Insights Founder Jon Hansen pointed out that while companies can’t transform without going through procurement and supply chain, we aren’t alone in the disruptive challenges we face. This month’s discussion topic is technology implementation ‘turn arounds’. Since implementations rarely go smoothly without considerable planning and communication, something both Philip and Kelly have experienced personally, nearly every implementation needs a turn around. Often, this stems from the misplaced expectation that implementation = digital transformation, and vice versa. | According to research undertaken by today’s guest, Procurement Insights Founder Jon Hansen, 70% of an organization's digital transformation activity passes through the procurement and supply chain. But is procurement prepared to step outside the frameworks of our historical job descriptions to proactively enable our companies to create and execute their digitization strategies? In today’s podcast, Jon and I discuss: Why the unknowns of digitization are impacting executives across the company, not just in procurement. The key obstacles to digital transformation. What can procurement do to take a leading role in enabling enterprise digitization | No one wants conflict for its own sake, but it can actually be an important factor in personal or organizational growth and decision making. Rather than shying away from conflict, especially in a professional context, procurement professionals need to start embracing it as proof of diverse thought and opportunities to practice empathy.  That is the point of view espoused by Jason Cammorata, Vice President of Strategic Sourcing at MDC Partners, and one that he is quite passionate about. Is this podcast, Jason shares his advice about how procurement can approach “good” conflict – a dynamic that usually stems from multiple people with different ideas but equally good intentions.  The procurement team at MDC Partners faces a unique challenge. They are an “umbrella” company with 55 brands in marketing that provide services such as public relations, creative, digital, advertising and production. Their decentralized corporate model is largely brand driven, so Jason regularly has to sell the benefits of procurement internally. That conversation usually starts with introductions and explanations and quickly advances to discover what the brand needs and how procurement can support them.  In this podcast, Jason answers questions such as: · What is more important: technical skills or personal skills? · When should procurement be firm (but nice) about frameworks and processes, and when should we be flexible? · Does procurement face a unique set of challenges today, or are we battling the same issues as all other functions? · What does relationship-driven procurement look like, and what are the benefits of investing in that approach? | It seems that we live in a service-centric world these days, and that includes a growing number of procurement spend categories. Although we’ve made headway in IT, legal and marketing, there is one category of professional services spend that still gives most of us reason to pause: management consulting. In this episode of the podcast, I ask Helene Laffitte, Founder and CEO of Consulting Quest, some of the questions I hear most frequently about managing consulting spend. For instance:  How can we find the ‘right’ consultant? When should I lean towards small/boutique consulting over the big brands? Are daily rates an effective pricing model? What if we don’t know exactly what we need from the consultants (yet)? What are the primary drivers of price in a consulting services agreement?  Ironically, when managing consulting spend, procurement’s best opportunity to add value may occur long before the list of participating providers is finalized and the RFP is sent out. According to Helene, the most critical activity when sourcing consulting is defining scope, objectives, milestones, deliverables and deadlines. These components will not only drive the qualification and selection process, they may determine whether or not the whole engagement is successful. As Helene points out, procurement’s ability to listen and discern the difference between what the business is asking for and what they need is essential. And once that need is defined, we move to challenge #2: being “tight” on what is needed while being “flexible” about the approach.\xa0 Listen in for advice and insight on this complex services spend category from a proven consulting procurement expert. | The commonly-cited disconnect between procurement and finance all comes down to one central question: where did the money go? As hard as procurement works to negotiate and track different types of savings, they always seem to evaporate or be reallocated for other projects. In the best cases, this gets the enterprise more value for their dollar, but in the worst cases can lead to reduced credibility for procurement – especially with finance.  I’m joined today by Dana Small, Global Category Manager at BioMarin and author of the Ms. Category Management blog. It is rare to find a procurement professional with a background in finance, and rarer still to find a procurement practitioner so willing to share their insight and experiences that they start a blog. In Dana we find both, and that’s a real win for the procurement community.  While working in Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A), Dana realized that by the time an efficiency opportunity is identified by finance, it is usually too late to act upon it. So she decided to move ‘up’ in the process, and pursued a role in strategic sourcing. At the encouragement of a colleague, she began sharing her experiences via a blog in early 2019. Doing so has not only bolstered her professional reputation, it has also changed how she reflects back on her “day job”.  In this podcast, Dana talks about the importance of reflection and perspective in all procurement work, whether it is tracking savings, working with suppliers or engaging with the community at large. | Last week, I had the opportunity to facilitate a webinar last week with procurement consulting firm Efficio, titled Driving Greater Procurement Performance from Complex Direct Spend and Factory Indirects.\xa0 In the webinar, I was joined by two of their US-based principal consultants, Arthur Mattouch and Waldo Saville.\xa0 During the webinar, Arthur and Waldo shared three case studies demonstrating the strategies and tactics that can be used to deliver sustainable savings in a mid-cap manufacturing environment.\xa0 In today’s podcast, I am sharing this case study, along with a couple of questions that I asked during the webinar.\xa0 This is a company looking to quickly reduce costs through a coordinated cost reduction program, while minimizing disruption on the business.\xa0 As you will hear, they ended up switching suppliers for only 12% of the total number of parts.

Selling your Day Camp like a pro.Overheard in your camp office:“Hello? _______ Day Camp how can I help you?”“Oh, you’re looking to register for this summer?”“I’m so sorry, but we’re full for this summer. We’ve actually been full since April, but I can absolutely put you on our waiting list if a spot opens up!”- scene -How awesome would it be to hear that conversation come from the office?Whether you’ve heard that in reality or just a far off dream, you know that the only way to make that happen is to put the work in and effectively sell your program. However, one of the tricky blessings that we have as camp pros, is that unlike Apple and Amazon’s army of marketing employees, we do it on our own, likely on an out-dated camp laptop and likely next to a STACK of other work we have on the go.When it comes to selling your camp like a pro, it would be easy, and maybe even fair, to throw up your hands and turn to a higher power to fill camp. However, not that we can confirm nor deny that a higher power will or won’t help, it’s not as hard as you might think to dip our toe, leg or entire body into the marketing waters.Enter The Day Camp Pod’s latest guest pro, Laura “Twigs” Johnson! Twigs joins Andy, Sam and Ehren to share her stories and best practices from starting not just one, but FIVE programs all in very short order. Laura and her team work wonders to sell her Leadership Academy programs, and we are so grateful for her openness and willingness to share with all of our listeners.

Maine-based digital therapeutics company that uses music to help drive clinical outcomes for people following neuro injury or disease.\xa0 The idea for the company was born when Owen's co-founder, Brian, utilized auditory techniques as a clinician at Spaulding Rehab to help people recover from walking deficits twice as fast as traditional physical therapy.\xa0 Now, MedRhythms is working towards FDA approval so they can reach patients across the globe.\xa0 Owen talks about what it's like to lead a start-up where failing fast and failing cheap is not an option when it comes to patient health, but staying nimble and moving fast is still crucial\xa0to success. | On this episode, I talk to Paul Stringer, owner of DHM Landscaping, a\xa0commercial maintenance landscaping company in Phoenix Arizona.\xa0 Paul purchased DHM almost three years ago with the idea of putting his tech and marketing experience to work in a company of his own.\xa0 His focus on delighting the customer with technology and service far above what is considered normal in the industry has propelled DHM to grow upwards of 45% per year.\xa0 Paul admits those rates are unsustainable indefinitely but remains committed to investing in his team and in technology to stay ahead of the competition. | On this episode, I speak with James Morin, co-owner and COO of Flowfold, an outdoor company that makes minimalist gear for everyday adventures.\xa0 James admits to initially selling wallets for beer money for almost five years while he and his partners prototyped their designs and raised some seed money, before going full time three years ago.\xa0 Since that time, they have been near doubling sales annually, thanks in part to collaborations with companies like LL Bean and entering international markets as far away as Japan.\xa0 Now, with revenues in the low 7-figures, James and his co-owners have their sights set on hitting $10 million in the next five years. | On this episode I speak with Jeff Small, founder of Strategic Media, a radio advertising company based in Maine that has a client list featuring the likes of Vistaprint, FanDuel, and eharmony.\xa0 Jeff has built the company around a core competency in traditional radio and his company has doubled over the last five years thanks to that focus.\xa0 Now, Jeff is looking out to 2025 with two goals in mind: to build expertise and business in the exponentially growing podcast sector and to donate $1 million dollars to local charities–the combination of which give Jeff and his team both purpose and drive. | On this episode, I speak with Phil Coupe, Co-founder of ReVision Energy, a full-service renewable energy contracting company in Maine that was ranked the #1 in New England – and #14 nationally – for rooftop solar in 2016.\xa0 Started in 2003 by two guys in a garage, Phil and his partners have grown ReVision to a 250-employee company spanning five locations in three states.\xa0 In 2017, Revision sold itself to its employees via an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) so we dive deep into this program, the founders’ reasons for pursuing it, and why they think it will set the company up for the next 100 years.We are taking a short break for the holidays.\xa0 The podcast will continue on January 11th. | On this episode, I speak with Peter Handy, CEO of Bristol Seafood, a seafood processing and distribution company.\xa0 Originally a research analyst on Wall Street, Peter bought Bristol four years ago and spent the first two learning the business under the previous owner before taking over as CEO in 2016.\xa0 Since then, Peter has focused on adding talent to the organization and putting in processes that will allow the company to “go fast.” \xa0Peter is on a mission to make seafood America’s favorite protein and he shares what the past four years have been like as a 32 year-old CEO of a small seafood company in Maine with large ambitions. | On this episode, I speak with Jeff Buckwalter, CEO of The Holy Donut, a Portland, Maine based retail and wholesale donut company whose hand-cut, hand-glazed potato donuts have developed a crazed following both locally and beyond.\xa0 With demand far exceeding supply for his donuts and persistent inquiries for expansion and even franchising, \xa0Jeff talks about his efforts to build the infrastructure necessary to support a growing company, the value of trust and accountability in developing his workforce, and the importance of conflict in a healthy organization. | On this episode, I speak with Colin Campbell, founder and CEO of Stratosphere Consulting, a national consulting company with an expertise in case management which made it to #488 on the INC 5,000 list thanks to their 1,000% growth over the past three years.\xa0 Operating as an entirely distributed company with no corporate office, Stratosphere has doubled their workforce for the past three years in a row.Colin shares what it is like managing what he calls “constant organizational change management” in such a fast-growing company, how he works on the businesses while still staying relevant to those working in the business, and his thoughts on process improvement in small businesses. | On this episode, I talk with Bob Smith, owner of Sebasco Harbor Resort, a 405-acre seasonal family vacation destination located on the coast of Southern Maine.\xa0 The self-proclaimed Keeper of the Lighthouse – a title in homage to his promise to preserve the 90-year legacy that came before him – Bob has spent his 21 years as owner setting the resort up to last another 90 years.Bob shares what it was like to live through the Financial Crisis – a setback that he is only now, some 11 years later, completely through–and his three-legged vision for the property to attract a long-term employer and build a residential community to complement the resort and its amenities. | On this episode, I talk with Bob Garver, co-founder of Wicked Joe, a wholesale roasting company and Bard Coffee, a retail coffee shop both located in Maine. After falling in love with the connections coffee can foster as an Army Captain stationed in Turkey, Bob has spent the past quarter-century sourcing, roasting, and brewing the best coffees he can find from around the world.From living on a boat with no kitchen or bathroom and plowing driveways on the side for supplemental income, Bob has remained focused on two things: relentlessly iterating on the perfect cup of coffee and positively impacting the entire coffee supply chain.\xa0 Whether it is blind taste tests on every batch of coffee produced or subsidizing farm expansion and community development at\xa0origin, Bob and his team continually strive to instill best practices throughout the organization.", 'chan_desc': "The Big Time Small Business podcast shines a spotlight on the small businesses you see every day but don't hear enough about.

Teaching someone how to build a courteous and respectful relationship with your patients is kind of awkward, isn’t it? But, it is so vitally important that patients feel valued, respected, and safe when they come to their healthcare practice. And it is just as important to healthcare business that we provide courteous service, clear communication and safe practices in an efficient and effective manner. Patient engagement and patient satisfaction is a key criteria to good health outcomes and a healthy business model. But, how do you get started to implement a patient satisfaction program? How can you teach your employees to demonstrate respect and open communication with patients and their families?

Jean, Your Practical Privacy Coach and Practice Management Mentor | A Privacy Impact Assessment is Easy – When You Start With a Good Plan! Do you need a PIA? or a PIA amendment? If you are a healthcare provider or clinic manager and are\xa0not sure if you need a Privacy Impact Assessment . . . then this 30 minute webinar / podcast is for you! If you are a custodian--including physicians, optometrists, dentists, chiropractors, nurse practitioners, podiatrists, and more!--as defined by Alberta's Health Information Act, then you probably need a PIA. Jean L. Eaton, Your Practical Privacy Coach, will explain  what a PIA is, why you need it, and how to start planning to prepare a PIA.  A PIA is an important tool that you can use to help you with that project management. It will help you anticipate risks to the project before it starts and avoid serious problems, wasted time and money. The PIA process requires you to have written policies and procedures so that you can implement the project effectively and train your staff consistently. Sometimes, after you have completed a foundational PIA for your practice, you want to add a new tool, move or add a new clinic location, or change the way that you collect, use, or disclose health information.\xa0 This may trigger a PIA amendment where you can build onto your original PIA submission. Sometimes a PIA is a requirement of legislation. But it is always a best practice whenever you implement a project that includes personal health information.

A consultant may be internal to your organization or external.

How does a leader lead through change by example?Make sure you have been listening to my episodes on fundamentals and the ‘Badass Way’. \xa0 Learn the basics of Agile Leadership and practice, practice, practice. When dealing with change, especially traumatic change, you’re going to need to lean on lessons learned in studying the Badass Way: Remember your ‘why’ - vision and service will free you from outcome dependence (a particular role, job, project or result) Remember to embrace failure and find gratitude in things that don’t go the way you expected Use the retrospective to document what, specifically, you learned from the experience  |  This week, we explore two very different questions submitted from two different listeners: how do you measure and describe ‘capacity’ when you have teams working on non-technical (or just ‘other’) issues, and….who wrote your theme song, and where can I download it? | One common question I get is how to become more influential. \xa0 If you want your massage to have impact - to resonate and to stick - just follow the example of those who have gone successfully before you.Impactful people and messages anchor their messages to existing powerful emotional or cultural touchpoint, repeat and spread the message, and then amplify the resulting waves. | There are two sorts of people you meet in the halls of a large enterprise; those who want to learn specific job skills so they can meet their targets, impress their bosses and get a particular job done. And then there are those who want to learn the skills of change and influence. Or those who simply want to be a part of something much bigger. On the one hand, it's easy to believe that there can't be leaders without followers. That some people are destined to accept the leadership of others, and help achieve somebody else's vision.But I believe that eventually, all people, or at least most of them, become visionary… Especially when they come face-to-face with their own limitlessness. | Everyone loves retrospectives. This is where we get to improve. Everyone loves demos… Because this is where we get to show off our finished work to the customer in waiting.But nobody ever mentions backlog grooming as their favourite scrum ceremony. But I think it should be.Often done poorly, grooming is the refining work that allows a backlog to remain current, relevant…and agileProper grooming can eliminate waste by keeping low priority items lowProper grooming allows us to maximize the time for development, testing and other meaningful work - rather than asking for clarifications mid-sprint, or building the wrong thingMost important, a good backlog grooming habit frees the team and PO to brainstorm and get the kitchen sink out there…knowing that the good ideas will stick and recur, and the bad ones will eventually fall off | You know what we should teach more of?\xa0 How to respond to mayhem - rapidly changing expectations in unstable conditions.What I’ve found - and what’s helpful to communicate to clients - is that the first 3 sprints (literally, the first 6-8 weeks) are mayhem.\xa0 On a new scrum team, or in new business/technical landscapes, there will always be challenges with insufficient information, assumptions, inadequate tools, unclear expectations, unfamiliar teammates and accountabilities….with firm deliverable dates.\xa0 Overwhelm is inevitable, and therefore wholly expected. But the alternative, which is happening more frequently, is to overplan the future (which is often futile).\xa0 The only thing that works is getting comfortable with discomfort.\xa0 Try, fail (aka ‘learn’), repeat. \xa0That’s how you improve, and eventually reduce mayhem - at least as much as is humanly possible. | There's been a change in how people organize in enterprise. But with flat hierarchies, and self-organizing teams, has the concept of leader or even team captains become obsolete and forbidden?Here are just 4 reasons why, despite the levelling of roles within teams, we still have - and need - captains and leaders…at least at times.Sometimes, people just need a little pushSomeone needs to hold themselves accountable to grow the teamA leader first and foremost sets an example for others to followPeople who are comfortable sharing wisdom must do so…for the benefit of the others in the team who are uncertain or inexperienced  | Seeking perfection is a major source of wasted effort; particularly if you are seeking it BEFORE taking action.There’s no such thins as perfect output, only perfect effort.Perfection is sought literately over time. \xa0Modern business requires that we move ideas from vision to backlog to executed Iteration One quickly. \xa0 In almost all cases, perfection is neither required nor desired out of the gate. \xa0Holding back or being unwilling to try for fear of making mistakes is the only kind of true failure. \xa0 Remember this - there IS such a thing as starting a race so late that it is practically impossible to win. | Forget Sprints and Standups - Business agility is about travelling light so you can go faster. \xa0\xa0One important way to do that is by taking small, frequent experimental risks, also known as placing small bets.Test with small investments - Rent or borrow equipment, Copy other success stories and replicate them in unrelated domains Get volunteers or part-timers to help. \xa0 Use gigstersLearning and research - Get aggregators or summaries Start with small commitments and experiments - lunch and learns versus coffees Slice your scope Work backwards from high-value outcomes ", 'chan_desc': 'A place for elite leaders and teams.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/59/5b/48/595b488b-e6ba-032f-ef76-afecb0abb585/mza_6205841373722790597.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2017-02-05'}}

Although the need for E&C programs has been around since the late 1970’s, until ECI released the HQP Assessment there has not be a definitive way to measure program quality and maturity. HQP was developed as a holistic approach toward continuous program improvement. HQP is the first definitive measure of E&C program quality and maturity. HQP can set a baseline for ongoing program measurement. HQP model provides a practical, structured approach to E&C program development.Subscribe & Review in iTunesAre you subscribed to my podcast?

This episode is all about the power of giving positive feedback! Giving positive feedback has nothing to do with warm-fuzzy feelings and kumbaya circles – it’s about human psychology. The bottom line is that your employees need to know when they’ve done good work and why their work is excellent, or they might not be your employees for much longer. But beware! Giving positive feedback isn’t as straightforward as it sounds: if used incorrectly, it can backfire on an unsuspecting manager.

This episode is about the Power Differential: the power managers have over their direct reports, and how to use it for good and not for evil. Having another adult in your life who has so much control over your time, tasks, and more is a bit…weird.
