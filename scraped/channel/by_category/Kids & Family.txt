Mona’s compassionate approach to therapy is based on brain science. She describes disruptive behaviors as “just the tip of the iceberg,” important signals a child may be sending that are symptoms of an underlying issue. This is common ground for Janet, as she has long held that many behaviors which parents deem negative are rarely motivated, intentional, or consciously anti-social. They are, in fact,  reflections of a dysregulated emotional state which needs to be acknowledged. Mona’s new book is available on Amazon: “Beyond Behaviors: Using Brain Science and Compassion to Understand and Solve Children\'s Behavioral Challenges.”For more advice on common parenting issues, please check out Janet\'s best-selling books on Audible, FREE with a 30-day trial membership if you use this link: adbl.co/2OBVztZ.

The child is sometimes disinterested and refuses to participate, and she wonders: “Is there a respectful approach to teaching children?” Janet responds with an alternative perspective on early childhood learning that focuses on providing the best foundation possible for children to develop their innate abilities and a lifelong love of learning.

One mom writes about her son\'s toy throwing: “He sees that I’m nursing the baby, or that my hands are full with dinner, and he’s frustrated that he doesn’t have my attention.” The other mom says that she has physical challenges: “And of course my smart kid has figured out that it’s easy to lash out on days when I am physically unable to deal.”  These moms are wondering what words to use and how to address behavior when they can\'t be as hands-on as they need to be.For more advice on common parenting issues, please check out Janet\'s best-selling books on Audible, FREE with a 30-day trial membership if you use this link: adbl.co/2OBVztZ.

While she and her husband both try to validate his feelings and talk about the fun parts of schools, he ends up whining and breaking down, saying he isn’t going to like it and doesn’t want to go.

She is overwhelmed by the responsibility of raising her child and wants to know: “What can I do to help myself?”  Janet and Elisabeth consider the common underlying issues of our own childhoods and how we can recognize and heal negative cycles to become better parents.

This isn\'t just about clearing the skeletons\xa0from the closet though; we\'re also talking about the most helpful ways our people showed up for us during these difficult times and the lessons we\'ve learned about how to take care of each other when the season is hard and the answers aren\'t coming easily.\xa0 Show Notes: Visit\xa0Coffee + Crumbs\xa0for links to everything we talked about in this episode.\xa0 To help fund Season Four of the Coffee + Crumbs podcast, head on over to our Patreon support page! \xa0 | This week we\'re talking about what mornings look like in our households. Spoiler\xa0alert: they\'re a far cry from our pre-kid days of leisurely sipping coffee while meticulously applying makeup and thoughtfully\xa0pulling together a coordinated outfit. In this conversation, Ashlee breaks down her new-ish routine designed to make mornings as non-chaotic as possible, April extols the virtues of doing allthethings the night before, and Indiana blows our minds when she confesses her children get up before she does AND fix their own breakfasts. From the pep in our step courtesy of the school system\'s tardy policy to our tactics for not yelling at our kids to just get their shoes on already (why is it always the shoes?), today we\'re breaking down our best efforts to start our days off on the right foot.

Sometimes we avoid talking about FOMO at the risk of sounding ungrateful, but the truth is there\'s an opportunity cost with every big decision in life ... and motherhood is no exception. From the temptation to compare ourselves with what we see on social media to actually missing out on things because we couldn\'t line up childcare or the toddler is sick (again), we open up honestly about where we struggle with FOMO and how we work to shift our perspective from one of lacking to one of gratitude.

In this conversation, we\'re talking about the products and perspectives that make the job a little easier and the importance of giving ourselves permission to see that fed is best.

From a false sense of control (surely good behavior is just a matter of consistent and firm boundaries ... right?) to the things we swore we\'d never do only to end up doing them (we\'re looking at you, goldfish crackers for dinner and weekly baths), there\'s a lot about motherhood that\'s upended who we thought we were. But then there are also the parts of us that are unchanged or have only been brought into sharper focus as result of becoming a mom. Whether you\'re preparing for your first or you\'re three or four kids into motherhood, we hope this episode makes you laugh and helps you reflect on how raising our kids influences the people we become, too.

Education consultant Ana Homayoun says it\'s all about  empowering your kids to make good decisions when you\'re not around. | From distracted parenting to "sharenting," an honest look at our own use of electronic media can make us into more skillful parents and better role models.   Here\'s what to remember:- Put your phone away whenever possible when you\'re with your kids. - If you want calmer children, be a more focused parent. - Before you post a picture or share a cute story about your kids on social media, think twice and get their permission if possible.  - Don\'t use technology to stalk your children. - Work for healthier technology for your kids, and for all of us. | Emotional outbursts. Lost sleep. These are signs that your kids are spending too much time with digital devices. Here\'s what you can do about it. Here\'s what to remember:- Pay attention to your children\'s emotional relationship with screens, not just how much time they are spending with them. - Don\'t just make technology rules based on time.  - Do guard bedtimes and mealtimes. - Don\'t expect taking away the phone to solve all your family\'s problems. - Mentor your kids; don\'t just monitor them. | The family that plays video games together, stays together. When parents become digital mentors, children can learn empathy, resilience, and prepare for future careers. Here\'s how to harness the advantages of screen time. Here\'s what to remember:- Whenever possible, share screens with your kids. - Balancing screen use is about much more than time.- Be smart about content. - Look for what\'s positive about your kids\' screen time so you can help those positive things grow. | Actress Sonia Manzano is beloved by millions as Maria on Sesame Street. Her character on TV mirrored many of  Manzano\'s real-life milestones, like marriage and motherhood (Elmo served as ring bearer for Maria\'s wedding on the show). She also wrote for Sesame Street in later years, and helped the show address diversity issues. In this special episode, Manzano reflects on her 44 seasons on Sesame Street, what she thinks was the show\'s most poignant moment  — and which Muppet was secretly her favorite. | Self-regulation skills, including self-control, help us reach our goals, learn in school and get along with others. Millions of children struggle to develop them. We talk to experts for strategies to teach these skills — and get some very special help from Cookie Monster. Here\'s what to remember:- Look at self-regulation as a skill that can be learned and practiced.- Teach children to calm themselves.- Use your imagination to reframe a temptation.- What would Batman do? Kids can channel their heroes to make it easier to live up to their values.- Be strategic about distractions.- Build self-regulation skills with activities like martial arts or music lessons. | By some estimates, up to 93% of American adults have some degree of math anxiety. The problem often starts in elementary school, but parents can do a lot to fix it. We talk to experts to get some some unexpected strategies for children of all ages, with a little bit of help from Sesame Street head writer Ken Scarborough and, of course, the Count.Here\'s what to remember: - Your own math anxiety doesn\'t have to hold your kids back.- Talk about math when you\'re sharing everyday activities.- Play math — with board games, card games, puzzles, and more.  - Forget about right and wrong answers. Keep things open-ended — life, and math, are more fun that way. | Most kids value success and achievement more than caring for others, according to Harvard\'s Making Caring Common project. Who is to blame? We are. We talk to experts for ideas on how to do better, and why.Here\'s what to remember:- Children are born to be kind — but also unkind. - Kindness requires courage.To build kindness, practice mindfulness.- Teach real apologies, and frame forgiveness as a gift you give yourself.- Practice gratitude to "raise the capital" of everyday kindness.- Kindness is a habit; rituals, chores and service can all help. | Whether a school shooting or a deadly tornado, scary events in the news can leave parents struggling to know when — and how — they should talk with their kids about it. Rosemarie Truglio of Sesame Workshop and Tara Conley, a media studies professor at Montclair State University, give us tips. - Limit their exposure to breaking news.- For the really big stories, pick a quiet moment and start the conversation by asking what kids have heard and how they\'re feeling.- Give facts and context: Let kids know that most scary news events are rare. Show them where it is happening on a map.  - When they ask why something happened, avoid labels like "bad guys." - Encourage kids to process the story through play, art, even video.- Take positive action together. | Even the most amicable split is world-changing for young children. Here are a few key tips for grown-ups trying to help their kids navigate this big transition. - Give children as much heads-up as you can — as soon as you\'ve made a definite decision to split up.- It\'s a grown-up problem. Don\'t share details that will confuse your child or hurt your partner.- Don\'t fear the big feelings or the "pajama truth-bomb." - It\'s good for kids to talk about a separation — even when it may be painful for adults to hear.- Make sure your kids know that not everything will change. - Keep routines, and toys, consistent, even if they\'re traveling from one home to another. - Look back together on the good memories.', 'chan_desc': 'Raising awesome kids takes help.

He and his friends Abigail, Elias and Vale are Explorers Troop 301, taking off from the Marlowe to explore uncharted planets, help the occasional alien, and solve a mystery that threatens to destroy the Marlowe. When pressed, we describe it as a "mystery gang" story, sort of like Scooby-Doo in space.The story is written and performed by Jonathan Messinger, author of Hiding Out, former web editor of Time Out Chicago Kids, and father of two boys. His son Griffin, 7, serves as editor of the story, appearing in episodes to critique, make predictions and express skepticism that his father knows what he\'s talking about, which also happens to be the way the rest of their relationship works.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/d6/36/6f/d6366f26-7221-35b3-c659-a760c3904673/mza_6064673713900167229.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2016-08-01'}}

We all need Jesus. It\'s just we need it in different ways. And he makes us more like him in different ways as well. It\'s called the body of Christ and we reflect Christ differently. We all need to bring our uniqueness to glorify him and bless each other.We talk about how using the Enneagram can improve communication and compassion in our marriages and what to do if your spouse has no interest in learning his type. (hint: the answer isn’t to bug him about it)\xa0Beth shares that no one pairing out of the 45 possible Enneagram matches in marriage is better than any other, but it’s our surrender to Christ that makes all the difference.\xa0I can guarantee you there is not a combination that is better or worse. Any two types that are surrendering and depending on the grace of God through Christ’s work on the cross on our behalf will be a blessing to one another.What we chat about: The origins of the Enneagram as a personality tool and why it matters how we use itLearning where we need to depend on Christ more as you understand more about your Enneagram typeUsing the Enneagram to help relate better in your marriageWhat to do when your spouse is resistant to learning about the Enneagram\xa0Learning about all nine types can help you have more compassion for your close relationshipsEmbracing the unique ways Christ made each person can help put an end to comparisonThe resources Beth has for using the Enneagram within marriageConnect with Beth: Website:\xa0 www.yourenneagramcoach.comFacebook:\xa0 facebook.com/YourEnneagramCoach\xa0Instagram:\xa0 @yourenneagramcoach\xa0Links Mentioned: Becoming Us: Using the Enneagram to Create a Thriving Gospel-Centered Marriage [BOOK]**Ep. 232: The Enneagram and Motherhood :: Suzanne Stabile [PODCAST]Enneagram Type Summaries from Your Enneagram Coach [WEBSITE]FREE Marriage Assessment from Beth [WEBSITE]Becoming Us Marriage Course [WEBSITE]Featured Sponsor: PrepDishPrep Dish meal plans were created by chef and dietician Allison Schaaf to help save you time and put home-cooked meals on the table.

And that means access to pornography and sexual imagery is everywhere too. Rather than bury our heads in the sand or cross our fingers that our kids won’t see porn, we can choose to be proactive and to give them a plan for how to react.\xa0Kristen Jenson, the best-selling author of "Good Pictures, Bad Pictures", joins me to share some simple ways to talk with our kids about porn and protect their minds.\xa0Pornography makes a child more vulnerable to sexual abuse. So if you porn-proof your child by starting these conversations early, you are actually helping your child to be more protected from child sexual abuse. When you start these discussions it\'s not as hard as you think. And once you do, you\'ve begun this journey with your child to trust you for answers. You tell them, ‘Don\'t go on Google to ask these questions. Come and talk to me.’This may feel like a super heavy topic, but I promise it’s worth taking the proactive approach now vs waiting till you have teenagers. Kristen shares a lot of resources and makes it easy to get started.\xa0What we chat about: What led her to write Good Pictures Bad Pictures**, a book that helps porn-proof young kids, and Good Pictures Bad Pictures Jr.**How pornography is a public health crisis and the negative effects it has on children and adultsTaking the proactive parenting approach helps kids be more resilient when they see pornWhen a child has any exposure or access to the internet you need to warn them about the dangers of the internet in simple, age-appropriate waysThese conversations are the same as talking to your kids about why we don’t eat or drink poisonous chemicals-- it’s all about safety.\xa0Helping kids learn about their “thinking brain” and their “feeling brain” and how to use them appropriatelyTeaching your kids a simple plan for how to respond when they see pornCAN DO: Close your eyes, Always tell a trusted adult, Name it when you see it, Distract yourself, Order my thinking brain to be the boss.Connect with Kristen: Website: protectyoungminds.orgFacebook: facebook.com/ProtectYM\xa0Instagram: @protectyoungminds\xa0Links Mentioned:\xa0\xa0Episodes with Mary Flo Ridley and Megan Michelson from Birds and Bees [PODCAST]Birds and Bees Curriculum [RESOURCE]Good Pictures Bad Pictures: Porn-Proofing Today\'s Young Kids [BOOK]Good Pictures Bad Pictures Jr.: A Simple Plan to Protect Young Minds [BOOK]Resources and a Quick-Start Guide for Proactive Parents [WEBSITE]Featured Sponsor:\xa0PrepDishPrep Dish meal plans were created by chef and dietician Allison Schaaf to help save you time and put home-cooked meals on the table.

She’s a mom of six boys and an author and entrepreneur. You may know her best from the beautiful watercolor prints and products she creates for her business on Gracelaced.com.\xa0In her newest book, Beholding and Becoming: The Art of Everyday Worship**, Ruth shares about how every day is an opportunity to be shaped and formed by what moves our hearts and captures our gaze.\xa0We dive into what that looks like in Ruth’s life and how choosing to focus on Christ changes everything from our perspective on our parenting and work to how we look at others.\xa0The most unhappy I get is if I get preoccupied with somebody else\'s story. And I don\'t give thanks and I don\'t jot down reminders of how he\'s provided for the ultimate story of redemption in my life. And also how he\'s working that out day by day and writing my story anew.We talk about how our fast-paced, hustle culture steals the joy and the beauty away from the everyday faithfulness of growing in God. My favorite reminder she shared is, “You don’t have to be blooming to be growing.”So true. How often do we start something and expect instant gratification and quick wins? We want easy-to-share glossy images of success. But God looks at our hearts. At the slow growing happening under the surface. We are all in process with God until we see him in heaven.\xa0Let’s celebrate the small wins and focus on turning our eyes toward God and away from the distractions and hollow gratification of social media. As Ruth reminds us, we become what we behold. Those small, unseen decisions really add up to who we are.\xa0Because at the end of the day, every action we have is really stemming out of our belief in our worship. And so how you think, and how you believe, and what you believe is the most beautiful and worthy of gazing at in your life will actually translate into what you do next. What your little moments every day are accumulating to be for a lifetime.What we chat about:Focusing on the beauty of what God has created vs comparing our lives to someone else’s on social mediaAt the root of dissatisfaction in our lives is an underlying struggle with identity. Is our identity found in Christ or is it found in everything going our way?Growing our appetite for the things of God by choosing to fill our time with his Word.The struggles women have with wanting to do something perfectly or not at all\xa0Celebrating the process of growing vs seeing immediate fruit in our livesWhat you believe is the most beautiful and worthy of gazing at in your life will actually translate into what you do nextThe goal isn’t just to experience God’s provision, but to trust that his presence in our lives is enough“Nearness to God brings likeness to God.

My guest Sissy Goff is here to share some of her insights on how to recognize worry and anxiety in your daughter and empower her to overcome.We talk about tools we can use to help us understand why our brains are often working against us in times of anxiety and grounding techniques to slow and stop the emotional spiral that often ensues.\xa0We always want her to know she\'s stronger than her worries and that she has a voice to talk back to the worry. A lot of people who work with kids call it the worry monster because that separates it out from her voice. We don\'t want her to think it\'s the truth, which is what kids are going to think when they have voices in their heads telling them things.This is a short, hope-filled bonus episode that just scratches the surface on all that we can learn about equipping our kids to work through anxiety. For more encouragement, follow Sissy and her team at https://www.raisingboysandgirls.com and watch for her book Raising Worry-Free Girls coming out September 17.\xa0What we chat about:1 in 4 kids are dealing with anxiety of some kind and girls are twice as likely to feel itAnxiety is hard to recognize in kids. Sometimes it comes out as anger or meltdowns and other times it’s deeply buriedPeople whose personalities lean toward Type A tend to have baseline anxiety at all times. If your child’s personality leans that direction, it’s important to give them tools to deal with itAnxiety is always an overestimation of the problem and an underestimation of ourselvesTechniques to help a child with anxiety calm down and redirect blood flow to their prefrontal cortexIntegrating our faith as we teach our kids to fight back against fear and worryConnect with Sissy:\xa0Website: raisingboysandgirls.comPodcast: raisingboysandgirls.com/listen\xa0Facebook: facebook.com/raisingboysandgirls\xa0Instagram: @raisingboysandgirlsLinks Mentioned:\xa0\xa0Raising Worry-Free Girls [BOOK] Releases September 17, 2019[Ep 160] Emotional Milestones:: Sissy Goff and David Thomas [PODCAST][Ep 141] Raising Girls:: Sissy Goff [PODCAST]Featured Sponsor: Treasured StudyThe “tween” years are a critical transition period in the life of a young girl.

This chat with Monica Swanson another mom of four boys and author of the new book Boy Mom dives into a lot of your questions about how to raise your boys to be godly men.\xa0We talk about encouraging strong friendships between brothers, teaching boys to be strong AND gentle, and about the importance of giving our sons ways to experience excitement and adventure while getting some of their natural aggression out in safe physical activities.I am a big believer that boys were made for adventure that they need to have some excitement in their lives I think is just how God wired them. They\'re little warriors who need to experience some thrills. A lot of the trouble boys can get into is related to when they\'re lacking authentic adventure, when they\'re not facing challenges and overcoming obstacles.Monica has two boys out of high school and two still in the nest, so she offers a lot of hope for those of us in the trenches of parenting to keep pressing into relationship with our sons and to make the practicals of faith an anchor in all that we do.\xa0God is so big and so powerful and he can move mountains on behalf of your son. He wants your son\'s heart more than you even know. We get our boys plugged in everywhere we can. We want them to have so many positive spiritual models in their life that there\'s no denying that God is the best way to go. It about coming alongside them and saying, ‘This is for your best. God is for you. Let\'s walk this life with him.’What we chat about:Monica’s four boys and working with very different personalities\xa0Building healthy brother relationships and dealing with kids who hitBoys need to let out their energy with exercise and physical activitySetting healthy boundaries for your kids with manners and learning to laugh with them about it tooTeaching boys how to balance strength and kindness by pointing them to the stories of godly menThe power of shoulder to shoulder conversations with boys and why to keep pressing into conversation with themMotivating boys to get excited about school and finding hobbies and interestsIdeas for how to foster adventure for your boys and learning not to parent from a place of fearFostering faith in your sons through time in the Word, prayer and modelingConnect with Monica:\xa0Website: monicaswanson.comPodcast: monicaswanson.com/podcastFacebook: facebook.com/TheGrommomInstagram: @monicaswanson_Twitter: @thegrommomLinks Mentioned:\xa0\xa0Boy Mom: What Your Son Needs Most from You ** [BOOK]What Your Kids, Marriage and Ministry Need :: Monica Swanson [Ep 82] PODCASTStrong: How God Equipped 11 Ordinary Men with Extraordinary Power **[BOOK]Knights in Training: Ten Principles for Raising Honorable, Courageous, and Compassionate Boy **[BOOK]20 Ways to Make Your Son Feel Loved [PRINTABLE]** As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

But what if we worried less about making a big impact. \xa0And focused more on doing the things in front of us with quality and depth?I’m a big fan of today’s guest,\xa0Shontell Brewer. She’s a wise mom to five kiddos (some she\'s launched out into the world). And she has an excellent sense of humor. More than that, she has discipled her children to love and serve others around them.Discipleship can be organic. Keeping your ministry small enough. To be present wherever God has placed you.In this episode, which originally aired in October of 2016 (Ep 140), Shontell and I talk about discipleship during dinner conversations. She shares her method of asking really specific questions. And giving her kiddos a challenge for the day to love others in tangible ways (e.g., encouraging a 4 year old to compliment his preschool teacher).My most favorite thing we talk about is Taco Tuesday. The last Tuesday of the month, the Brewer family serves up meat & tortillas. They invite\xa0coaches, teachers, friends, neighbors (any one who interacts regularly with their kids) into their home.\xa0We love on our community one taco at a time.I shared the idea with my boys and they wanted to do it the next night (“Taco Tuesday, but on a Monday”). I’ll let you know how that goes. We may go the Pizza Friday route (love our community one slice at a time).Shontell also inspired me to help open my boys’ spiritual eyes. And to encourage them to fight over who is going to put the other one first.What we chat about:How women apologize for their carpetKeeping your ministry smallSpecific questions to ask during dinner time conversationsHow Shontell helped her daughter minister to her Starbucks’ managerSending your kids to school with a basic challenge to bless someoneSetting the habit of conversation and other family “norms”Learning to not be offended when our kids aren’t performingParenting small with intimate corrective conversationsThe BEST idea to invite people into your home monthly–> Taco Tuesdays!Connect with Shontell:WebsiteFacebookTwitterInstagramFeatured Sponsor: Cultivate What MattersEver felt like you really want to plant the seeds of faith in your children’s heart but you don’t know how?

Or maybe if I read\xa0one more parenting book. Or if I finally caught the\xa0magical contentment unicorn just beyond my grasp.Of course, none of those options really pan out (especially the unicorn). It’s my own junk. Every day the yuck in my heart rises to the surface.\xa0But with the pace of life and needs of my people, it’s hard to stop and examine the “yuck” more closely.A few years ago our small group attended a recovery program at our church. Through some honest self-examination and community, God showed me where I’ve held wrong beliefs. And how they impacted my relationships.Today’s podcast guest, Lynn Hoffman, helped start our church’s recovery program 15 years ago. And God also led her to write “Steps into God’s Grace”, a bible study based on the 12 steps of recovery.In this episode, Lynn shares her own struggle with performance, people pleasing and codependency. She gives insight into why recovery isn’t just for addicts. And she encourages us to identify our own emotions so\xa0we\xa0can teach our\xa0children to do the same.Recovery became a safe place where I could go and be with other people who were willing to be honest. Stop pretending and start talking about the reality of the problems in their life. And lean on God to change and discover new realities in their life.Connect with Lynn:Website: StepsintoGodsGrace.comWhat we chat about:Lynn’s divorce/remarriage and struggle with wanting to do everything right.How she got her significance from her work and struggled to lean on God.The discovery of recovery and God’s call for her to write a 12-step based Bible study.Learning the lies Lynn believed and how they controlled how she behaved.The lies that go along with “working hard”.Why should anyone consider going through a 12-step recovery program.The spiritual/Biblical roots of recovery.The value of identifying your emotions in the moment.The difference between shame and guiltWhen we feel like a “mom failure” and how our worth is tied to our kids’ behavior and performance.Getting in touch with our own emotions to help our kids with their own emotions.Links Mentioned:“Steps into God’s Grace”\xa0by Lynn Hoffman **Jim & Lynne Jackson “You are Safe.

She and her husband moved their family from Australia to America more than 25 years ago. It was a faith-building journey that changed their family forever. \xa0\xa0Sometimes when you face life crises what God’s doing is setting a new foundation. In this time, he took everything away from us. We had no money, no resources, no family and no friends. \xa0But in that refining process, he gave everything back to us, but with a new foundation where he was the provider. He showed himself to be faithful for providing all our needs.This episode originally aired in May of 2017 as episode 166.

Would you be able to admit, or even recognize, if you were still doing that as a mom? In this phase of our lives, we aren\'t always put in peer pressure situations where our values are directly questioned by others, but managing our own expectations of who we think we "should" be and comparing our family to other families creates walls that limit us.Tawni Beardall and Erica Peterson are the co-hosts of a podcast for teens called Becoming.\xa0Tawni and Erica have become my real-life friends, and they hosted my first-ever Declutter Your Motherhood workshop. I absolutely love these ladies, and am so grateful for the work they are doing. In this episode, they point out three ways that we are a lot like the teenagers in our lives and give suggestions for how we can "overcome our inner teen": Have a threshold of zero. Do what is right (and right for you) no matter how many people are doing something different. Do work. We resist hard work for ourselves AND for our kids. And as human beings, we truly need the blessings of work. Make and keep friends. Our need for close friendships does not end after high school!

What about a toddler who was potty trained and has just reverted completely back to not using the potty at all but doesn\'t want to go back to pullups either? Erin answers these two questions and then also shares her struggle this week with her intense and persistent 10 year-olds brush with a very disappointing experience and how she dealt with it. | What do you do when your toddler stops napping or falling asleep at night when you get rid of the pacifier? Also what do you do with a toddler who wakes every night in the middle of the night and disrupts everyone\'s sleep? Erin answers both of these parenting questions plus some insights from her own week of parenting in this episode. | Erin answers 3 questions in this episode, the first on how and when you can engage your child in the process of a "no-gift" birthday party, how to deal with tantrums during diaper changes, and do you get your child a smart phone? If so, when? And also, if how do you deal with the pressure of "all my friends are on this app?" or "all my friends have...?" when it comes to keeping them safe from apps and other activities around smart phones? | How to turn around stressful morning to make them smoother with an uncooperative toddler? Erin gives some great tips on this and then answers questions about what to be aware of about the differences in raising boys and girls and how to teach kids social graces juxtaposed against the concept of \'stranger danger.\' | How do you help a toddler learn better behavior when they throw toys to show their anger? Ignoring has shown improvement but when it could hurt someone, this mom doesn\'t want to continue to ignore. What responsibilities should a 3 1/2 year be expected to take on? Erin shares a few tasks and how to teach her preschooler about this new expectation, along with a few other tasks she can begin prepping her son to take on in the coming months. | What do you do when a toddler uses biting to show negative emotions when coaching does not seem to be working? Then, Erin answers another question about when do you address/fix a behavior and when do you ignore it, when addressing it often times seems to make it worse? | What do you do when a family member feels compelled to correct your parenting? This episode is full of some great wisdom on common issues such as do you force affection from your kids? How about apologies? All with a complicated background of an adult-sibling relationship that is painful and this mom wants some insight as to how to deal with all of it. Erin gets in deeper in adult-sibling relationships, including her own, and how they can color both how we parent and the filters and beliefs our children can create about sibling relationships. | What do you do when your toddler shows interest and has some success and then is just having more accidents than success on the potty but doesn\'t want to go back to diapers either? Erin helps a parent assess readiness and gives a plan for addressing this quandary! When your toddler is speech delayed, communication is a struggle. Erin helps a mom with tips for increasing communication even with a speech delay and ways to handle the issues that are coming up due to the barrier. | Parenting can be so all-consuming. How do you balance your own needs and goals with those of your kids? When and how do you work those in? In this episode Erin talks about her own personal goals, how she makes them a priority and why she feels it is an important aspect of parenting to create some balance between supporting her kids\' needs and goals and her own. | What do you do when you toddler is overly sensitive to both feelings and physical sensations? Erin answers this mom with the first places to start trouble-shooting before working only on the behavior aspect. What about when your toddler doesn\'t seem to like the family dog and is consistently mean? How do you help teach that dogs are family and have feelings too?', 'chan_desc': "Erin Royer-Asrilant, LA's go-to expert on all things parenting and child development for today’s common challenges, covers way more than just discipline.

But if I take responsibility to take care of my own heart and soul, I will last much longer, much better, and even have peace and quietness if I take time to rest. | Motherhood keeps going and going! It is a long distance run and often we feel isolated and alone. Today, I am talking with my dear friends Margaret and Holly about the ways we have been challenged by the long-range reality of motherhood. I pray you will know that your long distance run matters every step of the way. We hope you’ll enjoy and be encouraged by our conversation! | Do you ever, like me, neglect to answer God’s call? Do you ever leave Him waiting?\xa0Sometimes we do so because we just don’t know what to say. Maybe we are feeling dry and exhausted, and we don’t even know what to read in His word. | Giving your child the gift of acceptance for who they were designed to be is one of the most valuable foundations you can provide. If we want our children to be able to embrace their own spiritual convictions and to be able to go against a secular culture, they must first learn to feel comfortable and confident in who they are, as they are. | Our deep longings become a platform for our hope in God. We sense there is something more that we were made for. If we can imagine fulfillment, deep, unconditional love, and long for the ‘more” that wrestles inside of us, we can assume it was because God made us for more. | As I began yet another time of study, I was vitally aware of the legacy of these morning times. I had invested literally thousands of hours at the feet of my greatest professor and teacher, Jesus. His words had made the difference between a wasted life and one focused strategically on the issues of eternity. This time was where I received His strength, wisdom, and direction for all the moments of my life—as a woman, wife, mom, daughter, and believer—here Christ had met me daily, shown me His path and His ways, and assured me of His constant companionship. | Yesterday, the Lord prepared a party for me. I almost didn't go, because I had planned busy-ness and duties for the hours of my day. But, something deep inside spoke to me of His invitation, and so I put everything else aside and drove to the party where He was graciously waiting for me. I am so glad I showed up, as He had prepared so very much for me to enjoy. | Join Joel and me as we talk about these things, about how music and story melded together to shape his imagination. Learn how you might be able to have Joel’s artistic music and photos and readings be a blessing to you and your family. And, of course, get your own copy of my new children’s book! | In a fallen world, where sin, death, and darkness have marred and hidden so many truths that God originally created us to know, we must look for the original patterns and follow diligently after them. I believe the reason so many are captivated by epic stories is because we were made to be a part of great adventure, divine beauty, and magnificent love. | Motherhood is hard. In a world of five-step lists and silver-bullet solutions to become perfect parents, mothers are burdened with mixed messages about who they are and what choices they should make. If you feel pulled between high-fives and hard words, with culture’s solutions only raising more questions, you’re not alone. But there is hope!!!!

To understand a woman\'s role, you have to study how a woman is made. Men have 50% more body strength than women. Women, on the other hand, are softer, and have the capacity to bear children. Dodds explains that just because a woman is created differently than a man doesn\'t make her inferior.

Rothman. She shares how her mission to end dating and sexual violence led her to create a pornography literacy program that helps teens learn about consent and respect -- and invites them to think critically about sexually explicit media. | For the past 20 years, photographer and TED Fellow Jon Lowenstein has documented the migrant journey from Latin America to the United States, one of the largest transnational migrations in world history. Sharing photos from his decade-long project "Shadow Lives USA," Lowenstein takes us into the inner worlds of the families escaping poverty and violence in Central America -- and pieces together the complex reasons people leave their homes in search of a better life. | Drawing on her research into early childhood development, psychologist Sara Valencia Botto investigates when (and how) children begin to change their behaviors in the presence of others -- and explores what it means for the values we communicate in daily interactions. (Watch for cute footage of sneaky toddlers.) | Everyone should participate in decision-making and politics -- and it starts at home, says activist Hajer Sharief. She introduces a simple yet transformative idea: that parents can teach their children about political agency by giving them a say in how their households are run, in the form of candid family meetings where everyone can express their opinions, negotiate and compromise. "We need to teach people that political, national and global affairs are as relevant to them as personal and family affairs," she says. "Can you really afford not to be interested or not participate in politics?" | Shocking, but true: the United States has the highest rate of deaths for new mothers of any developed country -- and 60 percent of them are preventable. With clarity and urgency, physician Elizabeth Howell explains the causes of maternal mortality and shares ways for hospitals and doctors to make pregnancy safer for women before, during and after childbirth. | The global fertility rate, or the number of children per woman, has halved over the last 50 years. What will having fewer babies mean for the future of humanity? In this funny, eye-opening talk, journalist (and self-described exhausted dad) Wajahat Ali examines how the current trend could lead to unexpected problems -- and shares why he believes we need to make it easier for people to have babies. "For those who can and choose to, may you pass on this beautiful thing called life with kindness, generosity, decency and love," he says. | Why do teenagers sometimes make outrageous, risky choices? Do they suddenly become reckless, or are they just going through a natural phase? To find out, Kashfia Rahman -- winner of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (and a Harvard freshman) -- designed and conducted an experiment to test how high school students respond to and get used to risk, and how it changes their still-developing brains. What she discovered about risk and decision-making could change how we think about why teens do what they do. | In a talk that\'s by turns heartbreaking and hilarious, writer and podcaster Nora McInerny shares her hard-earned wisdom about life and death. Her candid approach to something that will, let\'s face it, affect us all, is as liberating as it is gut-wrenching. Most powerfully, she encourages us to shift how we approach grief. "A grieving person is going to laugh again and smile again," she says. "They\'re going to move forward. But that doesn\'t mean that they\'ve moved on." | Neuroscientist and pediatrician Kimberly Noble is leading the Baby\'s First Years study: the first-ever randomized study of how family income changes children\'s cognitive, emotional and brain development. She and a team of economists and policy experts are working together to find out: Can we help kids in poverty simply by giving families more money? "The brain is not destiny," Noble says. "And if a child\'s brain can be changed, then anything is possible." | What does it take to build a national movement? In a captivating conversation with TEDWomen curator Pat Mitchell, Marian Wright Edelman reflects on her path to founding the Children\'s Defense Fund in 1973 -- from the early influence of growing up in the segregated American South to her activism with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- and shares how growing older has only made her more radical.', 'chan_desc': "Fun videos to inspire, intrigue and stir your imagination from some of the world's leading thinkers and doers onstage at the TED conference, TEDx events and partner events around the world.

As parents, we worry if they have any value...In this episode of the Read-Aloud Revival podcast, I\'m joined by the RAR Team, and we\'re talking all things graphic novels. Do they count as real reading? Will they make our kids lazy readers? And what about questionable content?What you\'ll hear in today\'s show ...what\'s happening in your child\'s brain when they read a graphic novel (aka what on earth is "multi-modal" reading?)why some kids can\'t get enough of themour favorite graphic novels to read in our own homesAnd you\'ll find a whole slew of our favorites in the booklist below.

Get the printable booklist            graphic novels we love | I\'m willing to bet that if you\'re reading this, you\'re hoping to raise kids who love reading.Think back for a second. Were the books you were assigned in school the same books you stayed up reading under the covers, late at night with a flashlight? When you were done writing the book report or the essay, did you eagerly start the book over, only to dive back into the utter delight of losing yourself in the story?Would you say those books became one of your childhood’s sweetest delights? Or were you just relieve to have "done" the book?See, all kids love stories when they are younger. Loving stories isn\'t the problem. The problem arises when reading becomes something we do for school—for a grade or an assignment. The problem arises when our kids start to see reading as something on their list of to-do\'s, rather than as one of life\'s sweetest delights. Today, we\'re turning that on its head. See, we have the opportunity to engage our kids with books differently-- in a way that helps them love a book more after they\'ve read it (rather than relieved that they\'re done with the book). It\'s simple and doable, and on this episode of the Read-Aloud Revival, I\'m breaking it down. Want to help your kids love reading? Don\'t miss this one.In today\'s show, you\'ll hear:4 simple steps you can take to change the way your kids interact with books... for the betterwhy this will be a game-changer for your child\'s reading lifeIf you\'d like a one-page printable guide that breaks down the four steps I talk about in this episode, just text REVIVAL to the number 33777, or enter your email below:         Get the Printable 4-step Guide            Want my notes on this one so you don\'t forget the 4 steps? Where should I send them? | Today, I\'ve got a podcast episode and an invitation to RAR Premium for you.First: the podcast. In this newest episode, I"m sharing what we\'re reading this fall at Read-Aloud Revival. We\'ve looked high and low and found what we think are three spectacular picture books and a novel (okay, a series) for you to share with your kids this fall.I\'ll tell you each of my selections and why I picked them. I can\'t wait for you to see these. 😍In the episode, you\'ll also hear...why your newly minted reader might not be a voracious one (and what to do about it)a great way to include Dad in reading aloudhow we can easily build memories just by reading together and having dinner (#winning)...and I answer a listener question about if it\'s OK to listen to a book before reading it.And now, your invitation: RAR Premium is the best we offer at Read-Aloud Revival, and I want to send you an official invitation to join us. (Imagine a bookish wax sealed envelope flying out of your screen and dropping into your lap. Now open it up...💌 )Each season in RAR Premium, we read 1 novel and 3 picture books as part of our Family Book Club. We choose books with kids of all ages in mind, because we believe that families connect best when they read together. 💚Here\'s what\'s up next in our Family Book Club: Premium Members also get a Family Book Club Guide to go with each of these, and we always wrap up by live streaming the author or illustrator of that book, so your kids can ask their own questions. There\'s just nothing else like it.… but actually, RAR Premium isn\'t just for your kids. In fact, most of our members would probably tell you that the person who gets the most from being a member is Mama herself! 😎That\'s because we offer regular Master Classes that help you teach from rest and lead with confidence in your homeschool. (We hear often that a single one of these classes is worth the price of membership… and we\'ve got a whole library of them for you to watch at anytime!)In fact, our very first Master Class this upcoming season is a class from me on Setting Yourself Up to Teach from Rest, so you can get your school year started on the right foot.We\'ve also got a seasonal Mama Book Club that will nourish your reading life (or bring it back to life, if it\'s been neglected lately—it\'s okay, we get it)If you want to make reading aloud the very best part of your upcoming school year, we are your people and RAR Premium is your place.

In this episode they discuss the premier of their reality TV show that recently aired on TLC. The first show primarily focused on the couples "lack of intimacy", how Mandy doesn\'t ask for help with the kids, and Jeff\'s inability to unplug from his businesses. But is that really what happens "behind closed doors"? Tune in to the podcast to find out! | Welcome to Season 2 of the Marriage More Podcast. We\'ve had A LOT of exciting things going on and can\'t wait to get you up to speed on the latest developments.

You\'re not connected anymore and you\'ve grown apart. Here\'s how to recognize if you\'re drifting in your marriage and how to fix it. | Join Jeff and Mandy as they have deep conversations about their marriage while preparing for bed. Okay, they\'re not really that deep but they are enjoyable. Learn the one thing that Jeff had no idea his wife doesn\'t like even though they\'ve been married for 12 years. | What a fun interview this was!

Throughout August (and some of September) we\'ll be focusing on work & school, two things that matter, and that we can find purpose in when we get intentional about our roles and choices in these areas of our life.\xa0 So far we\'ve talked to work at home moms, full time working moms, and today, we\'re focusing in on the work of homemaking and stay at home motherhood. We\'ll talk about ways we simplify work at home motherhood, and we\'ll also talk about finding purpose in our roles of stay at home motherhood. We even talk about ways we can care for ourselves when so much of our focus each day is on our children.\xa0 My guest, Celeste, has a perspective on homemaking and motherhood that any mom can resonate with, and she also works from home as well, so her perspective branches out into the work at home mom life as well.\xa0 Most of all, Celeste is just a JOY FILLED person!

It's the podcast that encourages you to let go of material things and clear out your space to make room for what matters. Believe it or not, your stuff takes up your time, and cluttered spaces can be a source of anxiousness. Fill your life with the people and things that you love, and get rid of the rest. Through conversations with other women and moms on the same simple-living journey, the Minimal-ish podcast will encourage you towards the grace-filled, realistic form of minimalism that benefits your life and family most. But it's not just about getting rid of your stuff or tidying up your home. There's so much more. Minimalism allows you to make room to live the life you want. This podcast discusses how to live the intentional life you want to live through simplifying in every area- how to make room so you can tell the story you want to tell with the life you've been given. Your host, Desirae Endres, is a stay at home/ work at home mom, teacher, and writer that believes that minimalism and having an uncluttered home environment can benefit everyone, but it doesn't look the same for everyone. Minimalism has changed her life, and if she can make minimalism attainable and sustainable in her life, anyone can. She brings honesty and transparency to the conversation as an admittedly (formerly-ish) unorganized, messy and anxious person as she discusses topics of minimalism, intentional, creative  living, motherhood, and more.
