He was a tough soldier who was ready to take charge of the unruly population of New Amsterdam. He soon clashed with Adrian Van der Donck, the leader of the opposition, who was secretly crafting a formal legal complaint that would compel the Dutch government to give the colony a form of representative government. When Stuyvesant discovered that Van der Donck had been spearheading an effort to overthrow his rule, he had him arrested for treason.\xa0But after a public faceoff revealed the Dutch government had come down on the side of colonists, Van der Donck was released. He returned to Europe and traveled to The Hague, where he argued that the Dutch government should take over the colony from the West India Company. At first, the Dutch government supported Van der Donck’s cause. It granted New Amsterdam a charter, giving the colony official status as a Dutch city, and ordered Stuyvesant's recall. But then order was abruptly rescinded. Oliver Cromwell’s English government was declaring war on the Dutch republic. Support us by supporting our sponsors!

Willem Kieft, the Dutch leader appointed by the West India Trading Company, declared war on local tribes, sending soldiers to slaughter them in their villages. The tribes responded with waves of death and destruction that would set the European settlers back decades in their development.\xa0A new colonist named Adriaen Van der Donck arrived to find the place in chaos. The colonists were furious at Kieft for endangering their settlement with his attacks. Van der Donck had been trained as a lawyer, and he soon found a role organizing the colonists against Kieft. He lobbied Kieft to permit the formation of a council to give the residents a say in their government. But when it became clear Kieft had no intention of giving the council any real power, Van der Donck responded by going over Kieft’s head and appealing directly to the leaders of the West India Company for intervention.\xa0The response wasn’t what he expected. It would lead to the appointment of a new Dutch leader, a hardliner tasked with wrestling the wayward colonists back under control.

For the first decade of its existence, the Dutch city on the tip of Manhattan Island served as a haven for pirates, prostitutes and smugglers. That was because the West India Company, which ran New Amsterdam, insisted on controlling all trade — something it simply couldn't manage effectively. Finally, in 1640, the Company gave up its monopoly, and what had been a rag-tag, Wild West kind of town quickly took on the hallmarks of Dutch capitalism.\xa0Trading firms in Amsterdam opened branch offices on Manhattan, and business boomed. Merchants traded in everything from furs to tobacco to Caribbean sugar and salt. Soon, Manhattan became a brash, free-wheeling pioneer settlement where visitors could hear some 18 different languages — at a time when the city’s population numbered only about 500.

New Netherland began with tiny numbers of people from different backgrounds. They settled the entire region that Hudson had traveled, from Delaware to New York to Connecticut. But being spread out so thinly exposed them to danger. In 1626, in the area around the future Albany, New York, a small party became embroiled in a fight between two native tribes, and some settlers were killed.In the aftermath, the colonists chose a new leader. Peter Minuit's first decision was to call all the settlers together for strength. Then he selected a location for a capital city, one that was strategically located in a world-class harbor and at the mouth of the colony's central river—a wilderness island called Manhattan.\xa0Support us by supporting our sponsors!

As supplies dwindled, Hudson announced to his frostbitten crew that the ship would change course. They set off across the Atlantic Ocean in search of an alternative route through the North American continent.Hudson never found the Northwest Passage, but he did come across something else on that journey — a small island the native people called Manna-hatta. That settlement would eventually give rise to a new Dutch colony called New Netherland, with Manhattan Island, or New Amsterdam, as it would come to be known, as its capital. New Amsterdam would come to be defined by two key Dutch values: tolerance and capitalism. This series by Russell Shorto, based on his book The Island at the Center of the World, traces how Manhattan’s brief chapter as a Dutch colony shaped the city for centuries to come. | The murder of Emmett Till galvanized the nascent civil rights movement.

For that, they turned to the Dutch-American physicist Samuel Goudsmit.\xa0Goudsmit wasn’t the brigade’s first choice—far from it. He was considered weak and timid, and even Goudsmit himself worried he lacked the courage for the mission. But the scientist had been friends with Werner Heisenberg as a young man in Europe, and he felt personally betrayed by Heisenberg’s work for the Nazis. And as a Jew who’d lost his parents to the concentration camps, Goudsmit was determined to fight back against Hitler.But Goudsmit would eventually prove himself, and his brilliant detective work would lead the mission to a cave in Germany hewn into the side of a cliff — Heisenberg’s secret lair and the heart of the Nazi bomb project.\xa0Support us by supporting our sponsors!

The country was divided after fighting a bloody civil war and had just experienced the first presidential assassination. We look at how these factors led to the first presidential impeachment in American history. | For centuries, the United States has been a prime destination for migrants hoping for better economic opportunities, fleeing danger in their home countries or just seeking a new life. But has there ever been a moment when Americans were the ones who felt compelled to flee elsewhere? In this episode, two stories that challenge the idea of who and why Americans sought refuge in other countries. | Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory in 1898 and for much of the next fifty years Puerto Ricans fought fiercely about this status. Should they struggle for independence, or to be a U.S. state, or something in between? In this episode, we look at Puerto Rico\'s relationship with the mainland U.S. and the key figures who shaped the island\'s fate. | When Lil Nas X released his viral hit "Old Town Road" last year, he sparked a conversation about what country music is and who is welcome in the genre. To better understand the deep and often misunderstood history of country music, we sat down with renowned filmmaker Ken Burns to talk about his new documentary series Country Music and his process as a storyteller. | There is more waste in the world today than at any time in history, and the responsibility for keeping the environment clean too often falls on individuals instead of manufacturers.

And in the last few weeks that conversation was rekindled when the NFL announced a deal with Jay-Z that some thought moved attention away from Capernick\'s continued absence from the league. The discussion about the utility of athletes taking a stand is nothing new - Black athletes using their platform to protest injustice has long been a tradition in American history. | Billie Holiday helped shape American popular music with her voice and unique style. But, her legacy extends way beyond music with one song in particular — "Strange Fruit." The song paints an unflinching picture of racial violence, and it was an unexpected hit. But singing it brought serious consequences.In a special collaboration with NPR Music\'s Turning the Tables Series, how "Strange Fruit" turned Billie Holiday into one of the first victims of the War on Drugs. | The United States imprisons more people than any other country in the world, and a disproportionate number of those prisoners are Black. What are the origins of the U.S. criminal justice system and how did racism shape it? From the creation of the first penitentiaries in the 1800s, to the "tough-on-crime" prosecutors of the 1990s, how America created a culture of mass incarceration. | The term "concentration camp" is most associated with Nazi Germany and the systematic killing of Jews during World War II. But colonial powers used concentration camps at the turn of the 19th century to crush rebellions. In this episode, how a war between Britain and South African Boers gave rise to some of the first camps. | Huey Pierce Long: you either loved him, or hated him.

She was one of the pioneers of X-ray crystallography and described by a colleague as \'a crystallographers\' crystallographer\'.  She remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in science, yet rejected the idea that she was a role model for other women, or that her career was held back because she was a woman. She was also the first woman since Florence Nightingale to receive the Order of Merit, and was given the Lenin Peace Prize in recognition of her efforts to bring together scientists from the East and West in pursuit of nuclear disarmament.With Georgina FerryScience writer and biographer of Dorothy HodgkinJudith HowardProfessor of Chemistry at Durham UniversityandPatricia FaraFellow of Clare College, CambridgeProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas developed by the Anglican priest John Nelson Darby (1800-1882), drawn from his reading of scripture, in which Jesus would suddenly take His believers up into the air, and those left behind would suffer on Earth until He returned with His church to rule for a thousand years before Final Judgement.  Some believers would look for signs that civilization was declining, such as wars and natural disasters, or for new Roman Empires that would harbour the Antichrist, and from these predict the time of the Rapture.  Darby helped establish the Plymouth Brethren, and later his ideas were picked up in the Scofield Reference Bible (1909) and soon became influential, particularly in the USA.

Soon his triumph was revealed as a great defeat; winter was coming, supplies were low; he ordered his Grande Armée of six hundred thousand to retreat and, by the time he crossed back over the border, desertion, disease, capture, Cossacks and cold had reduced that to twenty thousand. Napoleon had shown his weakness; his Prussian allies changed sides and, within eighteen months they, the Russians and Austrians had captured Paris and the Emperor was exiled to Elba.WithJanet HartleyProfessor Emeritus of International History, LSEMichael RoweReader in European History, King’s College LondonAndMichael RapportReader in Modern European History,  University of GlasgowProducer: Simon Tillotson | In the 500th edition of the programme, Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the philosophical idea of free will.Free will - the extent to which we are free to choose our own actions - is one of the most absorbing philosophical problems, debated by almost every great thinker of the last two thousand years. In a universe apparently governed by physical laws, is it possible for individuals to be responsible for their own actions? Or are our lives simply proceeding along preordained paths? Determinism - the doctrine that every event is the inevitable consequence of what goes before - seems to suggest so.Many intellectuals have concluded that free will is logically impossible. The philosopher Baruch Spinoza regarded it as a delusion. Albert Einstein wrote: "Human beings, in their thinking, feeling and acting are not free agents but are as causally bound as the stars in their motion." But in the Enlightenment, philosophers including David Hume found ways in which free will and determinism could be reconciled. Recent scientific developments mean that this debate remains as lively today as it was in the ancient world.With:Simon BlackburnBertrand Russell Professor of Philosophy at the University of CambridgeHelen BeebeeProfessor of Philosophy at the University of BirminghamGalen StrawsonProfessor of Philosophy at the University of ReadingProducer: Thomas Morris | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the context and impact of Pablo Picasso\'s iconic work, created soon after the bombing on 26th April 1937 that obliterated much of the Basque town of Guernica, and its people. The attack was carried out by warplanes of the German Condor Legion, joined by the Italian air force, on behalf of Franco\'s Nationalists. At first the Nationalists denied responsibility, blaming their opponents for creating the destruction themselves for propaganda purposes, but the accounts of journalists such as George Steer, and the prominence of Picasso\'s work, kept the events of that day under close scrutiny. Picasso\'s painting has gone on to become a symbol warning against the devastation of war.WithMary VincentProfessor of Modern European History at the University of SheffieldGijs van HensbergenHistorian of Spanish Art and Fellow of the LSE Cañada Blanch Centre for Contemporary Spanish StudiesandDacia Viejo RoseLecturer in Heritage in the Department of Archaeology at the University of CambridgeFellow of Selwyn CollegeProducer: Simon Tillotson. | Augustine\'s ConfessionsIn Our TimeMelvyn Bragg and guests discuss St Augustine of Hippo\'s account of his conversion to Christianity and his life up to that point. Written c397AD, it has many elements of autobiography with his scrutiny of his earlier life, his long relationship with a concubine, his theft of pears as a child, his work as an orator and his embrace of other philosophies and Manichaeism. Significantly for the development of Christianity, he explores the idea of original sin in the context of his own experience. The work is often seen as an argument for his Roman Catholicism, a less powerful force where he was living in North Africa where another form of Christianity was dominant, Donatism. While Augustine retells many episodes from his own life, the greater strength of his Confessions has come to be seen as his examination of his own emotional development, and the growth of his soul.WithKate CooperProfessor of History at the University of London and Head of History at Royal HollowayMorwenna LudlowProfessor of Christian History and Theology at the University of ExeterandMartin PalmerVisiting Professor in Religion, History and Nature at the University of WinchesterProducer: Simon Tillotson. | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas and life of one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, Emmy Noether. Noether’s Theorem is regarded as one of the most important mathematical theorems, influencing the evolution of modern physics. Born in 1882 in Bavaria, Noether studied mathematics at a time when women were generally denied the chance to pursue academic careers and, to get round objections, she spent four years lecturing under a male colleague’s name. In the 1930s she faced further objections to her teaching, as she was Jewish, and she left for the USA when the Nazis came to power. Her innovative ideas were to become widely recognised and she is now considered to be one of the founders of modern algebra.WithColva Roney DougalProfessor of Pure Mathematics at the University of St AndrewsDavid BermanProfessor in Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary, University of LondonElizabeth Mansfield Professor of Mathematics at the University of KentProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the jewels of medieval English poetry. It was written c1400 by an unknown poet and then was left hidden in private collections until the C19th when it emerged. It tells the story of a giant green knight who disrupts Christmas at Camelot, daring Gawain to cut off his head with an axe if he can do the same to Gawain the following year. Much to the surprise of Arthur\'s court, who were kicking the green head around, the decapitated body reaches for his head and rides off, leaving Gawain to face his promise and his apparently inevitable death the following Christmas.The illustration above is ©British Library Board Cotton MS Nero A.x, article 3, ff.94v95WithLaura AsheProfessor of English Literature at Worcester College, University of OxfordAd PutterProfessor of Medieval English Literature at the University of BristolAndSimon ArmitagePoet Laureate and Professor of Poetry at the Universities of Leeds and OxfordProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the philosophy of hope. To the ancient Greeks, hope was closer to self-deception, one of the evils left in Pandora\'s box or jar, in Hesiod\'s story. In Christian tradition, hope became one of the theological virtues, the desire for divine union and the expectation of receiving it, an action of the will rather than the intellect. To Kant, \'what may I hope\' was one of the three basic questions which human reason asks, while Nietzsche echoed Hesiod, arguing that leaving hope in the box was a deception by the gods, reflecting human inability to face the demands of existence. Yet even those critical of hope, like Camus, conceded that life was nearly impossible without it.WithBeatrice Han-PileProfessor of Philosophy at the University of EssexRobert SternProfessor of Philosophy at the University of SheffieldAndJudith WolfeProfessor of Philosophical Theology at the University of St AndrewsProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the planet Venus which is both the morning star and the evening star, rotates backwards at walking speed and has a day which is longer than its year. It has long been called Earth’s twin, yet the differences are more striking than the similarities. Once imagined covered with steaming jungles and oceans, we now know the surface of Venus is 450 degrees celsius, and the pressure there is 90 times greater than on Earth, enough to crush an astronaut. The more we learn of it, though, the more we learn of our own planet, such as whether Earth could become more like Venus in some ways, over time.WithCarolin CrawfordPublic Astronomer at the Institute of Astronomy and Fellow of Emmanuel College, University of CambridgeColin WilsonSenior Research Fellow in Planetary Science at the University of OxfordAndAndrew CoatesProfessor of Physics at Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College LondonProduced by: Simon Tillotson and Julia Johnson', 'chan_desc': 'Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the history of ideas', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/32/b1/87/32b18731-3fc2-8dbc-5f54-8d10835f4be2/mza_6299103342476961450.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2009-12-23'}}

So-called 'pleasure marriages' allow time-limited wedlock, sometimes for as little as half an hour, and with no commitment whatsoever. The practice is illegal, though some Shi’a clerics nevertheless claim it is permitted under Sharia, and offer to oversee pleasure marriages in return for payment. As Nawal al-Maghafi of BBC Arabic discovers in this disturbing story, the clerics’ lucrative business comes at enormous personal cost to many women, who are often tricked and coerced into marrying, only to be dumped shortly afterwards. Worse, their life-chances and even their lives are put at risk, because virginity is a prerequisite for proper marriage. Using undercover reporting and secret recording, the programme also finds clerics willing to supply women for sex, and even to officiate for men who want to have sex with children. | Citizenship is changing; and half the world’s governments are making money through citizenship schemes.

But there is a campaign to change the law and raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 without exceptions across all American states. | A Chilean man - adopted at birth and sent overseas - searches for the mother forced to give him up.

Turkey provides 70% of all hazelnut supplies – and the biggest buyer is Ferrero, maker of Nutella and Kinder Bueno. The confectionery giant says it’s committed to ethical sourcing, and aiming for its hazelnuts to be 100% traceable next year.

Then, he lets gravity do its thing and - without any safety gear - hurtles back down the roads, trying to dodge the traffic.

First, there was his regency council.\xa0 Then, when he took full power he replaced his regency council with his young friends and corrupt enablers. Then the old guard reasserted itself, along with the powerful Wulf dynasty of the midlands in the 990s.\xa0 And now, at 1006 it was turning over for a forth time. The old guard, having returned in what looks like an attempt to get the kingdom back on track, was now …legitimately really old. Queen AElfthryth’s faction was now dying out, and Uncle Ordwulf, Cousin AEthelweard, even Wulfric Spot are now dead and gone.

You go down your usual aisles, grab your bread, your tea, that thing you know you’re not supposed to eat but do anyway because it is delicious and you have no self control.\xa0And then, when you head to the register, something happens. You get in line. Right behind the person who was at the register right before you. You don’t know them, you don’t technically owe them anything. But you let them check out before you because they got in line first. And you can assume, most of the time, that the stranger behind you will do the same for you. Support the Show | The year 1002 was still 64 years away from 1066, but The House of Normandy had already begun a coup upon the Kingdom of England. The dynasty held only a minor Duchy, and for a fairly short amount of time, as it was only Duke Richard’s great grandfather Rollo who had established it. And in that time, there had been multiple points where it looked like the family would be ousted from even these comparatively minor holdings. Over the generations, the dynasty faced off with numerous powerful enemies:  Flanders, England, and even the throne of France beefed with the Dukes of Normandy.  And with such formidable enemies, it wouldn’t have been surprising if the  Normans had faded into a footnote in history. But they didn’t.  And part of the reason for that is that they didn’t just have powerful enemies.  They also had powerful allies.  Scandinavain allies.  And the Dukes knew how to wield them. Support the Show | Now that we’ve checked in with the rest of the world, let’s get back to our story…which lately hasn’t been going so well.  In the space of 70 years the Kingdom went from a preeminent power in the West to little more than a viking hunting preserve.By the year 1000, things had become so bad that the Viking armies were now just wintering on the island.  The English nobles, unable to oust them, were essentially paying for the invader’s room and board via danegelds. Which were pulled from local peasantry. Essentially, the English rulers were so incompetent, they were pillaging their own countryside. Support the Show | It’s so easy to lose the forest for the trees. This show is a show about one small island which, even at this part of the story, is still at the edge of civilization. It is very easy to forget that there is a whole other world out there… and, it is a world that keeps turning and the events that are happening at this point in history all over the world shaped who we are today.It’s the year 1000.

And, as we saw last episode, this meant that the King was once again redistributing wealth from the have-a-lots to the have-even-mores.Which meant that the dynasty of Wulfrun, the upteen cousin AEthelbrads, and Mom, were doing pretty damn well.\xa0Support the Show | And we are back! Thank you all for being patient while the BHP went on a brief parental leave.\xa0And speaking of things that are back…The Dowager Queen AElfthryth has returned to the King’s inner council following what looks like a political coup against AElfic of Hampshire and his faction.And just because it was political doesn’t mean it was bloodless.

That earlier ship had instructions to kill all adult men in Mytilene, after their unsuccessul revolt against Athens, as a warning to others.  The later ship had orders to save them, as news of their killing would make others fight to the death rather than surrender.  Thucydides retells this in his History of the Peloponnesian War as an example of Athenian democracy in action, emphasising the right of Athenians to change their minds in their own interests, even when a demagogue argued they were bound by their first decision. WithAngela HobbsProfessor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the University of SheffieldLisa Irene HauSenior Lecturer in Classics at the University of GlasgowAndPaul CartledgeEmeritus AG Leventis Professor of Greek Culture, University of Cambridge and Senior Research Fellow of Clare CollegeProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss how the people of Cusco, in modern Peru, established an empire along the Andes down to the Pacific under their supreme leader Pachacuti.  Before him, their control grew slowly  from C13th and was at its peak after him when Pizarro arrived with his Conquistadors and captured their empire for Spain in 1533. The image, above, is of Machu Picchu which was built for emperor Pachacuti as an estate in C15th. With Frank MeddensVisiting Scholar at the University of ReadingHelen CowieSenior Lecturer in History at the University of YorkAndBill SillarSenior Lecturer at the Institute of Archaeology at University College LondonProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the impact of Grant\'s presidency on Americans in the years after the Civil War in which he, with Lincoln, had led the Union Army to victory. His predecessor, Andrew Johnson, was prepared to let the Southern States decide for themselves which rights to allow freed slaves; Grant supported equal rights,  and he used troops and Enforcement Acts to defeat the Ku klux Klan which was violently suppressing African Americans.  In later years Grant was remembered mainly for the corruption scandals under his terms of office, and for his failure to support or protect Native Americans, but in more recent decades his support for reconstruction has prompted a reassessement.WithErik MathisenLecturer in US History at the University of KentSusan-Mary GrantProfessor of American History at Newcastle UniversityandRobert CookProfessor of American History at the University of SussexProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the most destructive riots in London\'s history, which reached their peak on 7th June 1780 as troops fired on the crowd outside the Bank of England. The leader was Lord George Gordon, head of the Protestant Association, who objected to the relaxing of laws against Catholics. At first the protest outside Parliament was peaceful but, when Gordon\'s petition failed to persuade the Commons, rioting continued for days until the military started to shoot suspects in the street. It came as Britain was losing the war to hold on to colonies in North America.The image above shows a crowd setting fire to Newgate Prison and freeing prisoners by the authority of \'His Majesty, King Mob.\'WithIan HaywoodProfessor of English at the University of RoehamptonCatriona KennedySenior Lecturer in Modern British and Irish History and Director of the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies at the University of Yorkand Mark KnightsProfessor of History at the University of WarwickProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life of Nero (37-68 AD) who became Emperor at the age of 16. At first he was largely praised for his generosity yet became known for his debauched lifestyle, with allegations he started the Fire of Rome, watching the flames as he played the lyre. Christians saw him as their persecutor, an anti-Christ,  and the number of the Beast in the Book of Revelation was thought to indicate Nero. He had confidence in his own artistry, took up acting (which then had a very low status) and, as revolts in the empire grew, killed himself after the Senate condemned him to die as a slave, on a cross. With Maria WykeProfessor of Latin at University College LondonMatthew NichollsFellow and Senior Tutor at St John’s College, University of OxfordAnd Shushma MalikLecturer in Classics at the University of RoehamptonProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss why the potato crop failures in the 1840s had such a catastrophic impact in Ireland.  It is estimated that one million people died from disease or starvation after the blight and another two million left the country within the decade. There had been famines before, but not on this scale. What was it about the laws, attitudes and responses that made this one so devastating?The image above is from The Illustrated London News, Dec. 29, 1849, showing a scalp or shelter, "a hole, surrounded by pools, and three sides of the scalp  were dripping with water, which ran in small streams over the floor and out by the entrance. The poor inhabitants said they would be thankful  if the landlord would leave them there, and the Almighty would spare their lives. Its principal tenant is Margaret Vaughan."With Cormac O\'GradaProfessor Emeritus in the School of Economics at University College DublinNiamh GallagherUniversity Lecturer in Modern British and Irish History at the University of CambridgeAnd Enda DelaneyProfessor of Modern History and School Director of Research at the University of EdinburghProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the effective partition of England in the 880s after a century of Viking raids, invasions and settlements.  Alfred of Wessex, the surviving Anglo-Saxon king and Guthrum, a Danish ruler, had fought each other to a stalemate and came to terms, with Guthrum controlling the land to the east (once he had agreed to convert to Christianity).  The key strategic advantage the invaders had was the Viking ships which were far superior and enabled them to raid from the sea and up rivers very rapidly.  Their Great Army had arrived in the 870s, conquering the kingdom of Northumbria and occupying York.  They defeated the king of Mercia and seized part of his land.  They killed the Anglo-Saxon king of East Anglia and gained control of his territory.  It was only when a smaller force failed to defeat Wessex that the Danelaw came into being, leaving a lasting impact on the people and customs of that area.With Judith JeschProfessor of Viking Studies at the University of NottinghamJohn HinesProfessor of Archaeology at Cardiff UniversityAndJane KershawERC Principal Investigator in Archaeology at the University of OxfordProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the impact on the British Isles of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, the most poweful man in the court of Elizabeth I.  He was both praised and attacked for his flexibility, adapting to the reigns of Protestant and Catholic monarchs and, under Elizabeth, his goal was to make England strong, stable and secure from attack from its neighbours. He sought control over Ireland and persuaded Elizabeth that Mary Queen of Scots must die, yet often counselled peace rather than war in the interests of prosperity.

It\'s going to hurt watching this one fall apart and we have to go there, too.This episode is especially recommended for fans of metaphysics, banjo, Dwight Yoakam, Emmylou Harris, Merle Haggard, Tales from the Tour Bus, Easy Rider and Forensic Files.Source | Buck Owens is an inkblot test. Ask 20 different people, get 20 different Bucks. Whatever else is true (and some of it certainly is), today we\'re talking about the one who brought real country music to the world in a time when we desperately needed someone to do that. Sticking to that real deal honky tonk sound from Bakersfield made him a very famous man. Shrewd business practices made him a very rich man. Both of these things made him more than a few enemies.However, all you need to take on the whole world is one true friend and Buck Owens had that friend in Don Rich, his guitarist and right-hand man. Here in the first part of this story, we\'ll hear how everything came together, all those years ago...This episode is recommended for fans of The Bakersfield Sound, Merle Haggard, Wynn Stewart, western swing, guitar, David & Goliath stories and the Revisionist History podcast.Source | They call him The Storyteller because he distills life into words.\xa0Behind any story worth telling, you\'ll always find another story. Maybe if we can get behind some of his best stories, we can reverse engineer the alchemy of Tom T. Hall. Maybe we\'ll find the story about who he is and how he\'s able to do what he can do with the English language...Probably not but, worst case scenario, it will be an incredibly entertaining waste of time. Beginning with a condensed history of country music radio, we follow Tom T. from his early days as a young DJ into a seemingly effortless realization of his destiny to become one of country music\'s greatest songwriters ever.This episode is highly recommended for fans of songwriting, arguing about music, Net Neutrality, the music business, Bobby Bare, Dave Dudley, Jimmy C. Newman, Hank Cochran and songs for children.Source | Jeannie C. Riley\'s debut single sold over a million copies within ten days of being released but she never wanted to record the song. She\'s often considered a one-hit wonder. We can easily disprove that.In the late \'60s, Jeannie C. Riley became country music\'s most blatant sex symbol to date but she never wanted to wear those clothes. Small town girl with big dreams goes to the city and lets it break her in order to make her. Total cliche, right?Sure.Except Jeannie\'s choice to bury the story in lie after lie turns it into a mystery tale of obscured identity, infidelity and blackmail. In this episode, some truth sees the light of day, maybe for the first time ever.Recommended for fans of Johnny Paycheck, Johnny Russell, The Wilburn Brothers, Tom T. Hall, Little Darlin\' Records and mystery novels.Source | Two words to sum up the career of Shelby Singleton?Publicity stunt.You think all it takes to make a hit record is to find a good song and get a good performance of it?That\'s cute. Have a seat and let an old-school record man show you how it\'s done. This is Shelby Singleton.When it took driving a trunk full of records around the country to make them into hits, that\'s what he did. Then he became a producer. Then he became a VP at Mercury Records. Then he founded an independent musical empire in Nashville and really got to work making new enemies.This episode is recommended for fans of: marketing, publicity, controversy, rockabilly, Supermensch (the documentary on Shep Gordon), George Jones, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, David Allan Coe, Margie Singleton, Jeannie C. Riley and Roger Miller.Source | The Louvin Brothers are widely regarded as the most influential harmony duo to ever cut a country song. The way Charlie and Ira could sing together is downright otherworldly.\xa0There\'s even a special term we had to invent for family (it\'s always/only family) who can sing this way: blood harmony. That being said, it\'s possible we\'ve never heard what they could really do.By the way, do you believe in evil?This episode delves in to exactly what blood harmony is and how the magic of it can\'t save you from beating the living hell out of each other at every opportunity.\xa0Here is the story of two dirt-poor brothers who fought for fifteen years to achieve their lifelong dream and what happened after that. (Hint: it involves whiskey and bullets.)This episode is recommended for fans of: singing, physics, the Radiolab podcast, mandolins and Roy Acuff.Source', 'chan_desc': "Want to hear a story? Country music is full of them, always with a killer soundtrack, sometimes a soundtrack made by a killer - like Spade Cooley, the only convicted murderer to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Or there’s the time Loretta Lynn released a song about birth control in the 1970s and everyone pretty much lost their minds. You’ve heard those? You sure? Millions of people think they know all about Merle Haggard’s 1969 song, “Okie from Muskogee,” but they’ve had it wrong the whole time. You’ll find those stories and others right here, obsessively researched, written and narrated by Tyler Mahan Coe, a lifelong veteran of country music and its mythology. Country music fans already know this is their new obsession but read the reviews and you’ll see how fast it’s catching on with listeners new to the genre. No other podcast is telling these stories, not like this. Start at the beginning. Press play. [If you aren't sure about the first episode, try Wynonna or the Kershaws. After that, though, you will want to return to the first episode and go from there. The show is constructed in seasons and episodes are presented in a careful order.

They think it is weak and spiritless to earn by sweat what they might purchase with blood.” Tacitus\xa0A little over 2,000 years ago, Rome was a well-oiled war machine crushing everything in its path. At that time, the Roman legions were the most deadly military force in the Western world, and possibly in the whole world. Every year, they conquered new peoples and pushed the boundaries of their empire. Rape and pillage was the name of the game, and they were masters at it. But in the year 9 CE, something happened in the forests of Germany that was going to have a profound impact on the destiny of the world.

His main passions (in no particular order) were Zen Buddhism, sex and drinking.

In this episode, we see Ikkyu’s wanderings taking him through torrid love affairs, friendships with pirate-merchants, and clashes with the Zen establishment. Living in an age of shoguns being assassinated, peasant uprisings, and the fury of the Onin War, Ikkyu found the time to save very Zen temple he had criticized throughout his life, and to launch an artistic renaissance that would have a lasting impact on Japanese history.

Jackson, editor of the Encyclopedia of New York, called Green "arguably the most important leader in Gotham\'s long history, more important than\xa0Peter Stuyvesant, Alexander Hamilton, Frederick Law Olmsted, Robert Moses\xa0and\xa0Fiorello La Guardia.\'\'So why is he virtually forgotten today? "Today not one New Yorker in 10,000 has heard of Andrew Haswell Green," wrote the New York Daily News\xa0in 2003.In our 300th episode, we\'re delighted to bring you the story of Mr. Green, a public servant who worked to improve the city for over five decades. And we\'ll be joined by an ardent Green advocate -- former Manhattan Borough Historian Michael Miscione. | Part Two of our series on the history of Brooklyn Heights, one of New York City\'s oldest neighborhoods.By the 1880s, Brooklyn Heights had evolved from America\'s first suburb into the City of Brooklyn\'s most exclusive neighborhood, a tree-lined destination of fine architecture and glorious institutions.The Heights would go on a roller-coaster ride with the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge and the transformation of Brooklyn into a borough of Greater New York. The old-money wealthy classes would leave, and the stately homes would be carved into multi-family dwellings and boarding houses.The new subway would bring the bohemians of Greenwich Village into Brooklyn Heights, transforming it into an artist enclave for most of the century. But even with addition of trendy hotels and the Brooklyn Dodgers (whose front office was located here), the Heights faced an uncertain future.When Robert Moses began planning his Brooklyn Queens Expressway in the 1940s, he planned a route that would sever Brooklyn Heights and obliterate many of its most spectacular homes. It would take a devoted community and some very clever ideas to re-route that highway and cover it with something extraordinary -- a Promenade, allowing all New Yorkers to enjoy the exceptional views of New York Harbor.This drama only served to highlight the value and unique nature of Brooklyn Heights and its extraordinary architecture, leading New York to designate the former tranquil suburb on a plateau into the city\'s first historic district.FEATURING: Truman Capote, Jackie Robinson, Gypsy Rose Lee, St. Ann\'s Warehouse, Matt Damon and the Jehovah\'s Witnesses! | This is the first of a two-part celebration of Brooklyn Heights, a picturesque neighborhood of architectural wonder, situated on a plateau just south of the Brooklyn Bridge.A stroll through Brooklyn Heights presents you with a unique collection of 19th century homes -- from wooden houses to brownstone mansions, all preserved thanks to the efforts of community activists in the 20th century.But in this episode, we\'ll explain how they got here. And the answer can be found on almost any street sign in the neighborhood -- Pierrrepont, Hicks, Middagh, Remsen.Those are more than just street names. Each sign traces back to an original landholder who developed this special place in the early 19th century. \xa0In a way, the neighborhood tells its own story.By then, the land once known as Clover Hill had seen its share of both tranquility and drama, the former site of a Revolutionary War fort and a crucial evening in the saga of the Revolutionary War. But in the 19th century, most Americans knew Brooklyn Heights for more than just architecture and George Washington. This was the home to respected cultural institutions and to scores of churches, so many that the borough received a very spiritual nickname.FEATURING: Henry Ward Beecher, Robert Fulton, the Marquis de Lafayette and, of course, the Lady Montague.boweryboyshistory.com | Dr. David Hosack was no ordinary doctor in early 19th-century New York. His patients included some of the city’s most notable citizens, including Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, both of whom he counted as close friends -- and both of whom agreed to bring him along to their fateful duel.But it was Dr. Hosack’s love and appreciation for the field of botany that would eventually make him famous in his time. In 1801 he opened his Elgin Botanic Garden on 20 acres of land located three miles north of the city on Manhattan Island.In this first public botanical garden in the country, Hosack would spend a decade planting one of the most extraordinary collections of medicinal plants, along with native and exotic plants that could further the young nation’s agriculture and manufacturing industries.\xa0And yet, he also spent a decade looking for funding for this important project, and for validation that this kind of work was even important.\xa0In this episode we discuss Hosack’s life and surprising legacy with Victoria Johnson, author of the 2018 book, “American Eden, David Hosack, Botany, and Medicine in the Garden of the Early Republic,” a New York Times Notable Book of 2018, a finalist for the 2018 National Book Award in Nonfiction, and a finalist for the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in History.  | Check out Mob Queens, a new podcast from Stitcher!

Imagine the unbearable smell of rotting food and animal corpses left on the curb. And what about snow, piled up and unshoveled, leaving roads entirely unnavigable?This was New York City in the mid-19th century, a place growing faster than city officials could control. It seemed impossible to keep clean.\xa0In this episode, we chart the course to a safer, healthier city thanks to the men and women of the New York City Department of Sanitation, which was formed in the 1880s to combat this challenging humanitarian crisis.Along the way, we\'ll stop at some of the more, um, pungent landmarks of New York City history -- the trash heaps of Riker\'s Island, the mountainous Corona Ash Dump, and the massive Fresh Kills Landfill.PLUS: We\'ll be joined by two special guests to help us understand the issues surrounding New York City sanitation in the 21st century:Robin Nagle\xa0is a Clinical Professor at NYU and the Anthropologist in Residence for New York City’s Department of Sanitation, and the author of "Picking Up - On the Streets and Behind the Trucks with the Sanitation Workers of New York City".Maggie Lee\xa0is the records management officer in the Sanitation Department, and also serves as the deputy director for Museum Planning for the\xa0Foundation for New York’s Strongest.\xa0She has helped organize “What is Here is Open: Selections from the Treasures in the Trash Collection” -- an art show centered around pieces thrown out with the trash, which is currently running at the\xa0Hunter East Harlem Gallery\xa0at 119th and 3rd Avenue through September 14, 2019. | EPISODE 295 This is a podcast about kindness and care. About the Progressive Era pioneers who saved the lives of people in need -- from the Lower East Side to Washington Heights, from Hell\'s Kitchen to Fort Greene.Within just a few decades – between the 1880s and the 1920s – so much social change occurred within American life, upending so many cultural norms and advancing so many important social issues, that these years became known as the Progressive Era. And at the forefront of many of these changes were women.In this show, Greg visits two important New York City social landmarks of this era -- Henry Street Settlement, founded by Lillian Wald in the Lower East Side, and the Cabrini Shrine, where Mother Frances X. Cabrini continued her work with New York\'s Italian American population.Then he pays a visit to the Brooklyn Historical Society and their exhibition Taking Care of Brooklyn: Stories of Sickness and Health, featuring artifacts from the borough\'s surprising connection to medical and social innovation -- from settlement houses to the birth control revolution advocated by Margaret Sanger.If you have ancestors who came through New York City during 1880s through the 1920s, most likely they came into contact with the efforts of some of the women featured in this show. From the White Rose Mission, providing help for young black women, to the life-saving investigations of \'Dr. Joe\' aka Sara Josephine Baker,\xa0leading the city\'s fight for improvements to public health.Greg is joined by several wonderful guests helping to tell this story, including Tanya Bielski-Braham (currently of the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh), Beckett Graham (of the History Chicks podcast), Julie Golia (Vice President for Curatorial Affairs and Collections at the Brooklyn Historical Society), Cherie Sprosty (director of liturgy at the Cabrini Shrine) and Katie Vogel (public historian at the Henry Street Settlement).\xa0boweryboyshistory.com | EPISODE 294 A tale of the \'sporting life\' of the Bowery from the 1870s and 80s. A former newsboy named Steve Brodie grabs the country\'s attention by leaping off the Brooklyn Bridge on July 23, 1886. Or did he?The story of Steve Brodie has all the ingredients of a Horatio Alger story. He worked the streets as a newsboy when he was very young, fighting the bullies (often his own brothers) to become one of the most respected newsies in Manhattan.He experienced his first taste of adulation and respect as a minor sports celebrity, participating in pedestrian competitions across the country. Back in New York, Brodie started a family and promptly lost most of his money at the race track. He yearned to do something athletic and attention grabbing again.The Brooklyn Bridge, completed in 1883, was a crowning architectural jewel linking two major cities; Brodie witnessed much of its construction during afternoons diving from East River docks. He now proposed an outrageous stunt that would garner him instant fame and fortune.He would jump off the Brooklyn Bridge!Was Steve Brodie a hero or a fool? A daredevil or a con artist? His story provides a window into the \'sporting men\' life of the Bowery and a look into what may possibly be the greatest hoax of the Gilded Age.boweryboyshistory.comOur thanks to Grant Barrett of A Way With WordsFeaturing clips from the 1933 film The Bowery, the 1949 Warner Brothers cartoon Bowery Bugs and the 1958 recording of "The Bowery" by Billy Randolph & The High Hatters | EPISODE 293 In Washington Heights and Inwood, the two Manhattan neighborhoods above West 155th Street, the New York grid plan begins to become irrelevant, with avenues and streets preferring to conform to northern Manhattan\'s more rugged terrain. As a result, one can find aspects of nearly 400 years of New York City history here -- along a secluded waterfront or tucked high upon a shaded hill.In this episode, we look at four specific historic landmarks of Upper Manhattan, places that have survived into present day, even as their surroundings have become greatly altered.\xa0-- A picturesque cemetery -- the final resting place for mayors, writers and scandal makers -- split in two;-- An aging farmhouse once linked to New York\'s only surviving natural forest with a Revolutionary secret in its backyard;-- A Roman-inspired waterway that once provided a vital link to New York City\'s survival;-- And a tiny lighthouse, overwhelmed by a great bridge and saved by a strange twist of fame.For those who live and work in Washington Heights and Inwood, these historic landmarks will be familiar to you. For everybody else, prepare for a new list of mysterious landmarks and fascinating places to explore this summer.And that\'s just the beginning! Upper Manhattan holds a host of fascinating, awe-inspiring sites of historical and cultural interest.

The road leading to Stonewall is often glossed over or forgotten.By the 1960s, a lively gay scene that traced back to the 19th century -- drag balls! lesbian teahouses! -- had been effectively buried or concealed by decades of cultural and legal oppression.A few brave individuals, however, were tired of living in the shadows.In this episode, we’ll be zeroing in on the efforts of a handful of young New Yorkers who, in 1966, took a page from the civil rights movement to stage an unusual demonstration in a small bar in the West Village. This little event, called the Sip-In at Julius\', was a tiny but significant step towards the fair treatment of gay and lesbians in the United States.IN ADDITION: We\'ll be joined by Hugh Ryan, author of When Brooklyn Was Queer, to talk about the forgotten lives of LGBT people in the ever-changing borough of Brooklyn.Visit our website for photographs and more details -- boweryboyshistory.comThis episode features an audio interview clip from the podcast Making Gay History, as well as a musical clip of \'I Hear A Symphony\' by The Supremes (Motown).Special thanks to our sponsor this week -- Flatiron School.', 'chan_desc': "New York City history is America's history.

Figures as diverse as Napoleon Bonaparte, Jean-Jaques Rousseau, and Tupac Shakur, have managed to find some deep wisdom in the pages of Niccolo Machiavelli\'s little book. Machiavelli\'s enduring allure has always been fueled by the controversy that swirls around his work. To this day there is no consensus around what Machiavelli\'s "real" goal was when he wrote The Prince. Is it possible to determine if Machiavelli deserves his bad reputation when there is so little agreement about him? Tune in and find out how 90\'s rap beef, The Grateful Dead, and the weirdest job application in history all play a role in the story.\xa0 | There are few political thinkers with as evil a reputation as the Florentine writer Niccolo Machiavelli. Machiavelli\'s philosophy was believed to be so cutthroat and cynically ruthless that some thought it was demonically inspired. There is even a historical myth that Niccolo Machiavelli\'s first name inspired the English to call the devil "Old Nick". Despite the fact that the story probably isn\'t true, Machiavelli\'s Satanic reputation has persisted. However, we need to ask if Machiavelli\'s reputation deserved. Have people been misunderstanding his writing for centuries?

After quickly realizing that there was a comparative dearth of material about Josefina and the Montoyas, Allison and Mary got to work and commissioned their listeners. As we are now all fond of saying, "Tia Dolores did it," and in this case, you did, too. Through the written word and through song, listeners took action and demanded new pasts, futures, and journeys for Josefina and Tia D. We consider the major trends and the bleak plotlines imagined by Josefina\'s fans. In the realm of pop culture, we also give our takes on the elite politics of Succession and the artwork of Amalia Mesa-Bains. Stick around for the end of the episode when we announce the winner of our first ever #GOAT Goat Writing Contest. | In the last book in the Josefina canon, we find that it is not justcomedies that end in weddings--sometimes tragedies do too. To bringthe Montoyas\' story to a close, author Valerie Tripp arranges amarriage between Papa and Tia Dolores, who will now take on the mantleof stepmother. While this book finds Josefina pondering the future ofher family, Mary and Allison use this opportunity to consider theoverall arc of the series and what it conveys about nationalism.

For this summer story,\xa0the family visits grandpa’s compound just outside of Santa Fe for a big trade meetup. Armed with the fruits of Tia D’s forced labor experiment, they are ready to make some cold hard coin.\xa0After luring a young Missourian scout with a clay pipe, Josefina fears that the Jason-Bateman-like Patrick O’Toole is not a trustworthy trade partner. Eventually, Josefina channels both Felicity Merriman & Nancy Drew to save the family’s big trade, but not before a bizarre night out in Santa Fe. As Mary and Allison discuss Josefina’s spring-break-like jaunt, they consider what it means for her to be an “American” hero in the context of US imperial intrusion. They also tackle the film trailer of the moment, LITTLE WOMEN, pig history, and most important of all, a Leo season engagement. | Why do fools fall in love? Why is the earth round? What is the meaning of life? Does Mary have a seltzer preference? We answer some of these questions, and many more, in this very special episode. During this brief detour from Josefina’s summertime sadness, we take listener questions and read from some of our correspondence with listeners. Trust us, it’s worth the Tripp. | Josefina: you know her, you love her, and at this point, you wish she could just catch a break. In book four, we find Josefina learning healing practices, both losing and then gaining a goat, and getting shortchanged on her first double -digit birthday. Though most of this book is about Josefina learning to do emotional labor and herbal medicine, Mary and Allison took this opportunity to examine whether Ms. Montoya is really a Pisces or is perhaps a Cancer or Taurus. \xa0They also question the continued lack of joy and friendship in Josefina’s life and the heavy overtones of Catholic shame that tinge her one moment of youthful hijinks. Finally, the hosts consider a few of the podcasts and television shows that are part of their world this summer.\xa0 | Surprise! We are three books into the Josefina series and everyone in the Montoya household is still super sad. As\xa0Mary and Allison continue their exploration of Josefina’s colonial world, they find her Christmas story to be both deeply moving and riddled with Catholic guilt. As the sisters continue to grapple with the loss of Mama, their grief is eclipsed only by Dolores’s drive to work. While evaluating the town’s\xa0Freudian passion play that is at the center of the action, Mary reveals her own thespian past & a Quincinera connection.\xa0 Finally, after\xa0unlocking a potential connection to the film Sister Act 2, Mary and Allison consider how religion has shaped American girls from Josefina to Hannah B. Perhaps most importantly, the hosts also use this episode to consider whether Bachelor contestants are most deserving of encounters with the sublime (i.e. Vermeer paintings and Dollywood). | In Episode 10, we explore Josefina Learns a Lesson, the second book in the Josefina series. One lesson we learn right away is never to judge a book by its (beautifully illustrated) cover. Though this book promises a school story, what it delivers is a story about a family being schooled by their once-absent aunt, Tia Dolores. Following a disastrous flood, Tia Dolores seizes her chance to inflict her priorities on the family. After making the family business solvent, Dolores begins her hotly contested campaign for literacy. Over the course of this episode, Mary and Allison consider Josefina\'s growing skillset (family therapy, weaving, sewing, spreading Catholic guilt) and whether Dolores is really just fleecing the Montoyas.\xa0We also wrap up our coverage of the HBO mega-hit Gentleman Jack, Taylor Swift’s contribution to Pride Month, and the couple bringing measles back. | In episode nine, we turn our gaze to the American Southwest & the youthful, plucky Josefina Montoya. Our analysis of Josefina’s books begins with two powerful questions—first, given the place and time, is this the story of a colonial girl? Second, just how many references to Tejana queen Selena will we make per episode? While representations of imperialism in early American history are hard to unpack, over the course of this show, we’ll reveal why Meet Josefina had us reeling for still other reasons. Maybe you didn’t see how this book set in an 1820s borderland community (what’s now New Mexico) was essentially ripped from the 1990s melodrama THE PIANO.\xa0But once you hear our take on Tia Dolores, you’ll see that’s why we’re here—note: we are also here to remind you of 90s crossover stars gone too soon.\xa0At the end of this episode, we put out a special call for you to contact our hotline! You may reach us at 1-860-455-4091 with YOUR hot takes for Pride Month 2019.

In episode eight, we consider Woodley’s turn as a spunky colonial frenemy in Felicity: An American Girl Adventure \xa0(2005). Along the way, we ask important questions about its team of producers, which was mysteriously led by none other than America’s sweetheart, Julia Roberts. This line of inquiry includes a stunning and hair raising revelation by Mary. We also wonder aloud why grown men take time to consume this material in a hate-watch fashion & then post about it. Lastly, Mary and Allison share their thoughts on the HBO-produced show everyone is talking about, and no, there is not a throne, but there is a queer hero.\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'The series you loved, book by book.

Rally behind the Virginians!” This is the story of violence on land and sea. Of violence unlike anything America has ever known. Tens of thousands of Union and Confederate forces clash near Virginia’s Bull Run River and Manassass railroad junction. Naive, young soldiers quickly learn their romantic notions of war are a farce, Thomas Jackson defends “like a stone wall,” and Yankees hear a horrific sound: “the rebel yell.” Things are calmer on the sea. Lincoln wants a blockade to hem in Confederate ships. The result is one international, diplomatic nightmare (the Trent Affair), and the most devastating attack in US naval history. The carnage and destruction wrought on the US Navy by the CSS Virginia (the Merrimack) won’t be matched or exceeded until 1941. Lincoln’s despondent. He has setbacks, on the field, turnover from General-in-Chief Winfield Scott to George B. McClellan, and a dying son. It seems nothing can go right. There is one exception though. Welcome back to the story young Ulysses S. Grant. | “I hope to have God on my side, but I must have Kentucky.” This is the story of the last, bare thread holding the Union together snapping. This is the start of the Civil War. US President Lincoln is giving Confederate President Jefferson Davis a difficult choice: let a peaceful, unarmed boat deliver supplies to Fort Sumter (and be seen as weak); or attack the unarmed boat (and be seen as the aggressor). Jeff chooses the latter. More states secede. Regiments form by the thousands on both sides. Blood flows in Missouri and Baltimore. And amid all of this, US Colonel Robert E. Lee faces the most important and difficult decision of his life: does he raise his sword against his nation? Or his home state and family?\xa0 The Civil War has begun. | "They are beautiful words, they are beautiful ideals... and there is beauty in seeing others as they make those words shift and close the gap towards reality" Today, we wrap up Volume IV: “Prelude to the Civil War.” Greg acknowledges some more pronunciation failures, the HTDS team mentions two fun emails, then gets to analysis. Particularly, we’re discussing how the Union tried over and over again to compromise on slavery, but came to its breaking point in 1860. Listen to Greg, Josh, and Cielle connect past episodes as they explain why that was the case. | “Mary, Mary, we are elected!”\xa0 This is the story of the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States … which means it’s also the story of secession. The presidential election of 1860 is split between four men: southerners John C. Breckinridge and John Bell, and northerners Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. Incredibly, Lincoln pulls off enough electoral college votes to win the presidency outright! He does so without a single electoral vote from the south. The election of this anti-slavery Republican is the final straw for the South. Citing the “increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery,” South Carolina secedes. Six others follow before Lincoln even takes the oath of office! They band together to create the Confederate States of America. Some think this secession talk will pass. Others think it can be undone peacefully. That theory will get tested fast as US troops at South Carolina’s Fort Sumter continue to stand their ground. | “Any man who took Lincoln for a simple-minded man would wind up with his back in a ditch.” This is the story of America on the eve of the Civil War.\xa0 Kentucky born farmboy Abraham Lincoln has an interest early life. Between losing his mom as a child, suffering from chronic depression, and receiving little formal education, you might not think he’d become one of the youngest state legislators in Illinois, a successful lawyer and a US Congressman. But that’s Lincoln. He’s a man who beats the odds, and he’s hoping to continue that streak as he challenges Stephen Douglas for his US Senate seat. Can he take down the “Little Giant?” It’s a political throw down that produces one of the most famous debates in US history as the two go head-to-head in over 20 hours of back-and-forth over the future of slavery. Speaking of slavery--John Brown’s looking to start a slave rebellion across the state of Virginia and not afraid to take over a US armory to do it! It’s a full on battle and the body count’s adding up fast … especially if we include the executions. | “Master Bass, if justice had been done, I never would have been here.” This is the story of betrayal. Restoration. Human trafficking. Daring selflessness. Oppressive inhumanity. Hope. And Forgiveness. A talented carpenter, driver, and violinist, Solomon Northup lives a happy life with his wife and three kids in upstate New York. The unassuming, kind-hearted man doesn’t think twice when offered good money to fiddle along with a circus act in Washington, DC. If only he’d known this was all a set up to kidnap him--a free-black American--then sell him under a false identity as a slave in New Orleans. Thanks to his own ingenuity and daring--and that of an anti-slavery Canadian and a dear friend and politician back home in New York--Solomon does make it back to the North and live to tell the tale. But his path back home isn’t short or easy. It will take 12 long years. | “We can send five thousand--enough to kill every God-damned abolitionist in the Territory.” This is the story of the Civil War’s warm up. The States are increasingly dividing along northern and southern (anti-slavery and pro-slavery) lines, and this that tention is coming out in spades in Kansas. Northerners want to see it become a free state; Southerners want it to be a slave state. The 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act is meant to produce a meaningful compromise, but it seems to only make things worse! Terrible violence is breaking out: Missourian “Border Ruffians” are illegally voting in Kansas and ruffing up Free state supporters; southern Congressman Preston Brooks beats northern US Senator Charles Sumner nearly to death in the Senate chambers; and abolitionist John Brown is hacking men to death with a broadsword! \xa0 Meanwhile, Dred Scott’s suing for his freedom.

He became famous in France and abroad for decades, rivalled only by Einstein and, in the years after the Dreyfus Affair, was the first ever Jewish member of the Académie Française.  It's thought his work influenced Proust and Woolf, and the Cubists. He died in 1941 from a cold which, reputedly, he caught while queuing to register as a Jew, refusing the Vichy government's offer of exemption.WithKeith Ansell-PearsonProfessor of Philosophy at the University of WarwickEmily ThomasAssistant Professor in Philosophy at Durham UniversityAnd Mark SinclairReader in Philosophy at the University of RoehamptonProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests dicuss what it means to be oneself, a question explored by philosophers from Aristotle to the present day, including St Augustine, Kierkegaard, Heidegger and Sartre.  In Hamlet, Polonius said 'To thine own self be true', but what is the self, and what does it mean to be true to it, and why should you be true?  To Polonius, if you are true to yourself, ‘thou canst not be false to any man’ -  but with the rise of the individual, authenticity became a goal in itself, regardless of how that affected others.  Is authenticity about creating yourself throughout your life, or fulfilling the potential with which you were born, connecting with your inner child, or something else entirely?  What are the risks to society if people value authenticity more than morality - that is, if the two are incompatible? The image above is of Sartre, aged 8 months, perhaps still connected to his inner child.With Sarah RichmondAssociate Professor in Philosophy at University College LondonDenis McManusProfessor of Philosophy at the University of Southamptonand Irene McMullinSenior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of EssexProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the remarkable achievement of Aristotle (384-322BC) in the realm of biological investigation, for which he has been called the originator of the scientific study of life. Known mainly as a philosopher and the tutor for Alexander the Great, who reportedly sent him animal specimens from his conquests, Aristotle examined a wide range of life forms while by the Sea of Marmara and then on the island of Lesbos.  Some ideas, such as the the spontaneous generation of flies, did not survive later scrutiny,  yet his influence was extraordinary and his work was unequalled until the early modern period.The image above is of the egg and embryo of a dogfish, one of the animals Aristotle described accurately as he recorded their development.WithArmand LeroiProfessor of Evolutionary Development Biology at Imperial College LondonMyrto HatzimichaliLecturer in Classics at the University of CambridgeAndSophia ConnellLecturer in Philosophy at Birkbeck, University of LondonProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the philosophy of hope. To the ancient Greeks, hope was closer to self-deception, one of the evils left in Pandora's box or jar, in Hesiod's story.  In Christian tradition, hope became one of the theological virtues, the desire for divine union and the expectation of receiving it, an action of the will rather than the intellect.  To Kant, 'what may I hope' was one of the three basic questions which human reason asks, while Nietzsche echoed Hesiod, arguing that leaving hope in the box was a deception by the gods, reflecting human inability to face the demands of existence. Yet even those critical of hope, like Camus, conceded that life was nearly impossible without it.WithBeatrice Han-PileProfessor of Philosophy at the University of EssexRobert SternProfessor of Philosophy at the University of SheffieldAndJudith WolfeProfessor of Philosophical Theology at the University of St AndrewsProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Bernard Mandeville (1670-1733) and his critique of the economy as he found it in London, where private vices were condemned without acknowledging their public benefit.  In his poem The Grumbling Hive (1705), he presented an allegory in which the economy collapsed once knavish bees turned honest.  When republished with a commentary, The Fable of the Bees was seen as a scandalous attack on Christian values and Mandeville was recommended for prosecution for his tendency to corrupt all morals.  He kept writing, and his ideas went on to influence David Hume and Adam Smith, as well as Keynes and Hayek.With David WoottonAnniversary Professor of History at the University of YorkHelen PaulLecturer in Economics and Economic History at the University of SouthamptonAnd John CallananSenior Lecturer in Philosophy at King’s College LondonProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas of Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu (1689-1755) whose works on liberty, monarchism, despotism, republicanism and the separation of powers were devoured by intellectuals across Europe and New England in the eighteenth century, transforming political philosophy and influencing the American Constitution. He argued that an individual's liberty needed protection from the arm of power, checking that by another power; where judicial, executive and legislative power were concentrated in the hands of one figure, there could be no personal liberty. With Richard BourkeProfessor in the History of Political Thought at Queen Mary, University of LondonRachel HammersleySenior Lecturer in Intellectual History at Newcastle UniversityAndRichard WhatmoreProfessor of Modern History at the University of St Andrews and Director of the St Andrews Institute of Intellectual HistoryProducer: Simon Tillotson. | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859) and his examination of the American democratic system. He wrote De La Démocratie en Amérique in two parts, published in 1835 and 1840, when France was ruled by the July Monarchy of Louis-Philippe. Tocqueville was interested in how aspects of American democracy, in the age of President Andrew Jackson, could be applied to Europe as it moved away from rule by monarchs and aristocrats. His work has been revisited by politicians ever since, particularly in America, with its analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of direct democracy and its warnings of mediocrity and the tyranny of the majority.WithRobert GildeaProfessor of Modern History at the University of OxfordSusan-Mary GrantProfessor of American History at Newcastle Universityand Jeremy JenningsProfessor of Political Theory and Head of the School of Politics & Economics at King's College LondonProducer: Simon Tillotson. | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss St Augustine of Hippo's account of his conversion to Christianity and his life up to that point. Written c397AD, it has many elements of autobiography with his scrutiny of his earlier life, his long relationship with a concubine, his theft of pears as a child, his work as an orator and his embrace of other philosophies and Manichaeism. Significantly for the development of Christianity, he explores the idea of original sin in the context of his own experience. The work is often seen as an argument for his Roman Catholicism, a less powerful force where he was living in North Africa where another form of Christianity was dominant, Donatism. While Augustine retells many episodes from his own life, the greater strength of his Confessions has come to be seen as his examination of his own emotional development, and the growth of his soul.WithKate CooperProfessor of History at the University of London and Head of History at Royal HollowayMorwenna LudlowProfessor of Christian History and Theology at the University of Exeterand Martin PalmerVisiting Professor in Religion, History and Nature at the University of WinchesterProducer: Simon Tillotson. | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas attributed to Sun Tzu (544-496BC, according to tradition), a legendary figure from the beginning of the Iron Age in China, around the time of Confucius. He may have been the historical figure Sun Wu, a military adviser at the court of King Helu of Wu (who reigned between about 514 and 496 BC), one of the kings in power in the Warring States period of Chinese history (6th - 5th century BC). Sun Tzu was credited as the author of The Art of War, a work on military strategy that soon became influential in China and then Japan both for its guidance on conducting and avoiding war and for its approach to strategy generally. After The Art of War was translated into European languages in C18th, its influence spread to military academies around the world.The image above is of a terracotta warrior from the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor, who unified China after the Warring States period.With Hilde De WeerdtProfessor of Chinese History at Leiden UniversityTim BarrettProfessor Emeritus of East Asian History at SOAS, University of LondonAndImre GalambosReader in Chinese Studies at the University of CambridgeProducer: Simon Tillotson. | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas developed by Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43BC) to support and reinvigorate the Roman Republic when, as it transpired, it was in its final years, threatened by civil wars, the rule of Julius Caesar and the triumvirates that followed. As Consul he had suppressed a revolt by Catiline, putting the conspirators to death summarily as he believed the Republic was in danger and that this danger trumped the right to a fair trial, a decision that rebounded on him. While in exile he began works on duty, laws, the orator and the republic. Although left out of the conspiracy to kill Caesar, he later defended that murder in the interests of the Republic, only to be murdered himself soon after.With Melissa LaneThe Class of 1943 Professor of Politics at Princeton Universityand 2018 Carlyle Lecturer at the University of OxfordCatherine SteelProfessor of Classics at the University of GlasgowAndValentina ArenaReader in Roman History at University College LondonProducer: Simon Tillotson.", 'chan_desc': 'From Altruism to Wittgenstein, philosophers, theories and key themes.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/5c/46/f1/5c46f108-a754-a241-d706-1e6392cb27e4/mza_928566899035012339.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '1998-12-10'}}

Por razones nunca esclarecidas, miles de embarcaciones han desaparecido cruzando esta superficie de aproximadamente un millón de kilómetros cuadrados entre Florida, Puerto Rico, y Las Bermudas. Todo comenzó en 1945 cuando una escuadrilla de aviones de guerra estadounidenses desapareció sin dejar rastro, dando paso a otros casos donde se menciona actividad paranormal, puertas tridimensionales e incluso abducciones alienígenas. EL nombre fue creado en 1953 cuando varios escritores publicaron la peligrosidad de la zona en sus artículos, dando origen a una serie de novelas e historias que hicieron de este lugar un verdadero misterio.

About five months later, he was based in Vietnam, fighting a very deadly and secret war in Laos and Cambodia. For John and his fellow Green Berets, the war in Vietnam was fought in the shadows. And they arguably gained considerable ground in the fight, despite virtually zero public recognition for their contributions at the time. Their efforts were audacious and struck at the heart of an enemy fighting an unconventional war - tricky ground for the larger conventional U.S. force so often associated with the war. John takes us through the mindset of the Green Beret preparing for and facing off against such a largely unconventional enemy, sharing what it was like to operate so close to them, that at one point an enemy soldier unwittingly touched John\'s boot in the pitch-black darkness as he crawled past him and his team.

But, the blast did not take his zeal for life. Listening to him talk about this experience, you would never think that he\'s faced great challenges and extremely low moments trying to get back to the normalcy of everyday life. He has handled his injuries with the same bravery and stoicism he displayed when taking "point" while searching the village compound that hid the IED that changed his life forever. He\'s even looked past his injuries and "limits" and started competing in triathlons as a double amputee.

Although his family lived in a rough neighborhood on a very low income, Pasha was happy and proud to be living in America, whose opportunities far outnumbered those of his birthplace. In an effort to repay the U.S. government for the assistance provided to him and his family after they arrived from Moldova, Pasha enlisted in the Army, shortly after the war in Iraq kicked off in 2003. Following multiple deployments to Iraq, Pasha had been blown up more than once, and suffered multiple Traumatic Brain Injuries. His experiences left him with the lasting effects of PTSD. In this episode he talks about his journey - how he survived multiple blasts and came face-to-face with a suicide bomber, and how he is now working through the issues caused by his injuries. This is an open and insightful conversation about the indelible wounds of war we can\'t see that are still plaguing servicemembers long after they come home.www.getheadstrong.org | www.teamrubiconusa.orgDo your Amazon shopping with us, and give back to veterans organizations at the same time!

But if history has anything to say about it, there\'s no doubt he\'s earned his stripes, going all the way back to his first overseas assignments in Vietnam. Early on, Galloway was embedded with the 1st Cavalry Division during the Battle of Ia Drang, the first major battle of the Vietnam War. He not only covered the battle, but also fought to save the lives of other American soldiers during fierce ground fighting. He was eventually awarded the Bronze Star with "V" for Valor for rescuing wounded soldiers under fire at Ia Drang, becoming the only civilian to receive a combat medal from the Army during the Vietnam War. Galloway would serve a total of four tours in Vietnam, and then cover every major American conflict up to the Global War on Terror.

Murphy considered it an honor to serve his country, so leaving his small, South Dakota farming community for the Army and Vietnam, was tough, but not a big deal. When he shipped off to Vietnam, he figured as a mortarman he\'d probably be stationed at a basecamp somewhere and not spend much time in the jungle. But the situation changed rapidly when he hit the ground, and he quickly went from mortarman to infantryman living in the jungle. Just 30 days before the end of his 12-month tour, Murphy was shot twice during a firefight and left paralyzed below the waste. His attitude throughout it all and to this day has been nothing short of amazing.

He secured an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy, setting him on a course to become a combat-tested leader, as the Global War on Terror erupted only a couple of years before he graduated and entered active duty. Since then he has served as a Cavalry Scout, Troop Commander, and military advisor in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cathcart sits down in-studio to reflect on the loss he experienced in combat and the “what-if’s” that changed the course of human lives.

Joining the Navy when his country was at war, Lockhead went into the service as a cook. After the battle at Tarawa, the loss of Marines was so great, that the Navy asked for volunteers to learn how to perform reconnaissance and underwater demolition for future beach landings. Harry volunteered, and became one of the Navy\'s first Underwater Demolition swimmers, or "Naked Warriors" as they were known. With no instruction manual, Harry and his team of other volunteers had to learn how to clear beach landings in combat, literally by trial and error. Lockhead would eventually become one of the original UDT20 Frogmen, and predecessors of the Navy SEALS. It\'s an amazing feat, considering the conditions and timeline these men operated under.

Desiring a military job that was both dynamic and challenging, she signed up for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). She loved being an EOD soldier and showed great promise as a young bomb tech on her team while deployed in combat. But it only took one critical incident to end all of that. On November 4, 2007, her military career came to an end when she literally bear hugged an IED that her team was disarming, when it became unstable in their vehicle, in an attempt to save her teammates\' lives. The explosion took both of her arms, but never damaged her spirit and the strength she now calls upon to live each day and inspire and help others who have reached a low point in their lives.

The King was a victim of a conflict known as the pizza wars, when Chuck E. Cheese faced off against its rival, Showbiz Pizza for pizza arcade supremacy. The foot soldiers in the pizza war were the animatronic bands that staffed each location—including The King. This episode is a chronicle of the pizza war, with the founder of Chuck E. Cheese, Nolan Bushnell, it's rival, Showbiz Pizza's Aaron Fechter, the people who designed the characters and animatronics, and the people who continue loving these characters, like Jared Sanchez, who continue to create work with these once discarded creatures.Learn more about your ad choices.

She was one of the pioneers of X-ray crystallography and described by a colleague as 'a crystallographers' crystallographer'.  She remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in science, yet rejected the idea that she was a role model for other women, or that her career was held back because she was a woman. She was also the first woman since Florence Nightingale to receive the Order of Merit, and was given the Lenin Peace Prize in recognition of her efforts to bring together scientists from the East and West in pursuit of nuclear disarmament.With Georgina FerryScience writer and biographer of Dorothy HodgkinJudith HowardProfessor of Chemistry at Durham UniversityandPatricia FaraFellow of Clare College, CambridgeProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss how scientists sought to understand the properties of gases and the relationship between pressure and volume, and what that search unlocked. Newton theorised that there were static particles in gases that pushed against each other all the harder when volume decreased, hence the increase in pressure. Those who argued that molecules moved, and hit each other, were discredited until James Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann used statistics to support this kinetic theory.  Ideas about atoms developed in tandem with this, and it came as a surprise to scientists in C20th that the molecules underpinning the theory actually existed and were not simply thought experiments. The image above is of Ludwig Boltzmann from a lithograph by Rudolf Fenzl, 1898With Steven BramwellProfessor of Physics at University College LondonIsobel FalconerReader in History of Mathematics at the University of St Andrewsand Ted ForganEmeritus Professor of Physics at the University of BirminghamProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss theories about the origins of teeth in vertebrates, and what we can learn from sharks in particular and their ancestors. Great white sharks can produce up to 100,000 teeth in their lifetimes.  For humans, it is closer to a mere 50 and most of those have to last from childhood.  Looking back half a billion years, though, the ancestors of sharks and humans had no teeth in their mouths at all, nor jaws.  They were armoured fish, sucking in their food.  The theory is that either their tooth-like scales began to appear in mouths as teeth, or some of their taste buds became harder.  If we knew more about that, and why sharks can regenerate their teeth, then we might learn how humans could grow new teeth in later lives. With Gareth FraserAssistant Professor in Biology at the University of FloridaZerina JohansonMerit Researcher in the Department of Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museumand Philip DonoghueProfessor of Palaeobiology at the University of BristolProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss how members of the same species send each other invisible chemical signals to influence the way they behave.  Pheromones are used by species across the animal kingdom in a variety of ways, such as laying trails to be followed, to raise the alarm, to scatter from predators, to signal dominance and to enhance attractiveness and, in honey bees, even direct development into queen or worker. The image above is of male and female ladybirds that have clustered together in response to pheromones. With Tristram WyattSenior Research Fellow at the Department of Zoology at the University of OxfordJane HurstWilliam Prescott Professor of Animal Science at the University of Liverpooland Francis RatnieksProfessor of Apiculture and Head of the Laboratory of Apiculture and Social Insects at the University of SussexProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the remarkable achievement of Aristotle (384-322BC) in the realm of biological investigation, for which he has been called the originator of the scientific study of life. Known mainly as a philosopher and the tutor for Alexander the Great, who reportedly sent him animal specimens from his conquests, Aristotle examined a wide range of life forms while by the Sea of Marmara and then on the island of Lesbos.  Some ideas, such as the the spontaneous generation of flies, did not survive later scrutiny,  yet his influence was extraordinary and his work was unequalled until the early modern period.The image above is of the egg and embryo of a dogfish, one of the animals Aristotle described accurately as he recorded their development.WithArmand LeroiProfessor of Evolutionary Development Biology at Imperial College LondonMyrto HatzimichaliLecturer in Classics at the University of CambridgeAndSophia ConnellLecturer in Philosophy at Birkbeck, University of LondonProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas and life of one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, Emmy Noether. Noether’s Theorem is regarded as one of the most important mathematical theorems, influencing the evolution of modern physics.  Born in 1882 in Bavaria, Noether studied mathematics at a time when women were generally denied the chance to pursue academic careers and, to get round objections, she spent four years lecturing under a male colleague’s name. In the 1930s she faced further objections to her teaching, as she was Jewish, and she left for the USA when the Nazis came to power. Her innovative ideas were to become widely recognised and she is now considered to be one of the founders of modern algebra.With Colva Roney DougalProfessor of Pure Mathematics at the University of St AndrewsDavid BermanProfessor in Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary, University of LondonElizabeth Mansfield   Professor of Mathematics at the University of Kent Producer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the planet Venus which is both the morning star and the evening star, rotates backwards at walking speed and has a day which is longer than its year.  It has long been called Earth’s twin, yet the differences are more striking than the similarities.  Once imagined covered with steaming jungles and oceans, we now know the surface of Venus is 450 degrees celsius, and the pressure there is 90 times greater than on Earth, enough to crush an astronaut. The more we learn of it, though, the more we learn of our own planet, such as whether Earth could become more like Venus in some ways, over time. WithCarolin CrawfordPublic Astronomer at the Institute of Astronomy and Fellow of Emmanuel College, University of CambridgeColin WilsonSenior Research Fellow in Planetary Science at the University of OxfordAnd Andrew CoatesProfessor of Physics at Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College LondonProduced by: Simon Tillotson and Julia Johnson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the properties of atoms or molecules with a single unpaired electron, which tend to be more reactive, keen to seize an electron to make it a pair. In the atmosphere, they are linked to reactions such as rusting. Free radicals came to prominence in the 1950s with the discovery that radiation poisoning operates through free radicals, as it splits water molecules and produces a very reactive hydroxyl radical which damages DNA and other molecules in the cell. There is also an argument that free radicals are a byproduct of normal respiration and over time they cause an accumulation of damage that is effectively the process of ageing. For all their negative associations, free radicals play an important role in signalling and are also linked with driving cell division, both cancer and normal cell division, even if they tend to become damaging when there are too many of them.With Nick LaneProfessor of Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College LondonAnna CroftAssociate Professor at the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at the University of NottinghamAnd Mike MurphyProfessor of Mitochondrial Redox Biology at Cambridge UniversityProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the history of real and imagined machines that appear to be living, and the questions they raise about life and creation. Even in myth they are made by humans, not born. The classical Greeks built some and designed others, but the knowledge of how to make automata and the principles behind them was lost in the Latin Christian West, remaining in the Greek-speaking and Arabic-speaking world. Western travellers to those regions struggled to explain what they saw, attributing magical powers. The advance of clockwork raised further questions about what was distinctly human, prompting Hobbes to argue that humans were sophisticated machines, an argument explored in the Enlightenment and beyond.The image above is Jacques de Vaucanson's mechanical duck (1739), which picked up grain, digested and expelled it. If it looks like a duck...with Simon SchafferProfessor of History of Science at Cambridge UniversityElly TruittAssociate Professor of Medieval History at Bryn Mawr CollegeAnd Franziska KohltDoctoral Researcher in English Literature and the History of Science at the University of OxfordProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss how some bats, dolphins and other animals emit sounds at high frequencies to explore their environments, rather than sight. This was such an unlikely possibility, to natural historians from C18th onwards, that discoveries were met with disbelief even into the C20th; it was assumed that bats found their way in the dark by touch. Not all bats use echolocation, but those that do have a range of frequencies for different purposes and techniques for preventing themselves becoming deafened by their own sounds. Some prey have evolved ways of detecting when bats are emitting high frequencies in their direction, and some fish have adapted to detect the sounds dolphins use to find them.

Billions of dollars worth of gold bars and priceless artifacts were sent to him to hide in caverns and tunnels, and usually the prisoners who helped to dig the tunnels and pits and transport the bullion were killed. But legend persisted in the Philippines about buried loot and one man found it. His name was Rogerio Roxas. But when the corrupt president Marcos caught wind of that find, the end was in sight for Roxas, and Marcos was on his way to becoming the wealthiest man on Earth. How much is legend- and how much is fact- you can decide. This is the story of Yamashita\'s Gold. Credit BBC Marcos Gold.

Congressman Dan Sickles and his beautiful young wife were among the most popular party hosts in the city, until Congressman Sickles discovered that his best friend, US District Attorney Philip Barton Key, the dashing son of Francis Scott Key, had been having an affair for the past year with Sickle\'s wife Teresa.\xa0 When Sickles saw Key outside his home in Lafayette Park using a handkerchief signal to invite her to their trysting place- he flew into a rage, grabbed three pistols, walked out into the park, and shot and mortally wounded Key. The news of the murder and trial shook the world, and became the most publicized American murder of the century.

Newman by Richard Etheridge and crew in 1879; plus stories of life-saving legends Dunbar John Davis (NC) and Capt. Joshua James (Massachusetts)..Etheridge, a former Union soldier and slave who was born on the Outer Banks, was awarded head keeper of the Pea island Life Saving Station, the only all-black life saving facility in the country, and unlike many of\xa0 his white counterparts,, his crew was overlooked when medals were given to surfmen who had acted courageously to save lives. Etheridge;s crew\'s saving of the 9 passengers aboard the storm-tossed E.S. Newman during hurricane conditions was submitted for review recently and the well earned awards were given posthumously.

As follow up letters arrived, the Broadduses delayed moving into the house, fearing for their three children. City, federal, and private investigators got involved, and although they turned up some possibilities- they ended with no suspects. Netflix won a bidding war for the story this past December, and just a month ago the Broaddus family sold the house at a huge loss to an undisclosed buyer.

The director of the British Museum in London has spent the past year choosing objects from the museum\'s vast collection to represent a two million year story of humanity. Throughout this week he has been with objects that that speak of the great shifts in human organisation and thinking in the modern world. Here he describes the object that he has picked as his last; it\'s a solar-powered lamp and charger that he believes can revolutionise the lives of poor people around the globe. The portable panel can provide up to 100 hours of light after just 8 hours of direct sunlight. It can also charge mobile phones and help bring power to millions of people around the world who have no access to an electrical grid. Simple, cheap and clean - this is revolutionary technology for the future. Nick Stern, the expert on the economics of climate change, describes the potential impact of new solar technology. Neil explains why he has chosen a solar-powered lamp and charger as his final object - with examples of how it is already being used in rural Bengal and urban Kenya. Producer: Anthony Denselow. | Neil MacGregor\'s history of the world as told through things. Throughout this week he is examining objects that speak of the great shifts in human organisation and thinking in the modern world - objects that raise questions about human lives, the environment and global resources. So far this week he has chosen things that deal with political and sexual revolution and that confront the disaster of global arms proliferation. In today\'s episode he considers the morality of modern global finance and its implication for the future. He tells the story with a credit card that is compliant with Islamic Sharia law - what does that mean and how does it work? He talks to the Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, and to Razi Fakih of the HSBC bank.Producer: Anthony Denselow. | The history of humanity, as told through one hundred objects from the British Museum in London, is drawing to an end. Throughout this week, Neil MacGregor, the director of the British Museum in London, has been with things that help explain the modern world. He has explored political and sexual politics and freedoms, and now reflects on the impact of guns and weapons in the modern world - especially in Africa where thousands of children have been participants in brutal conflicts. He tells the story through a work of art - a sculptured throne made from decommissioned guns like the ubiquitous AK47. We hear from Kester, the artist from Mozambique who created the Throne of Weapons and test the reaction to the piece of Kofi Annan, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations.Producer: Anthony Denselow. | This week Neil MacGregor\'s history of the world is examining the forces that helped shape our way of life and ways of thinking today. He began with the political revolution that exploded In Russia in the 1920s and today he moves on to the sexual revolution of the 1960s. He explores the emergence of legally enshrined human rights and the status of sexuality around the world. He tells the story with the aid of a David Hockney print, one of a series that was made in 1966 as the decriminalisation of homosexuality was being planned, at least in Britain. We hear from David Hockney on the spirit of the decade and from Shami Chakrabarti, the director of the human rights group Liberty Producer: Anthony Denselow. | Neil MacGregor\'s history of the world as told through things that time has left behind. Throughout this closing week he is examining some of the major social and political movements that have helped shape our contemporary landscape. Today he tells the remarkable story of a Russian plate. It was made in 1901 in the Imperial Porcelain Factory in St Petersburg. Twenty years later it was painted over as a propaganda tool for the new Communist Revolution - decorated in the same factory that had become the State Porcelain Factory and in a city renamed as Petrograd. The director of the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Mikhail Piotrovsky, and the great historian of modern Russia, Eric Hobsbawn, help piece together this momentous history.Producer: Anthony Denselow. | Neil MacGregor\'s world history told through objects from the British Museum in London. The objects he has chosen this week have reflected on mass production and mass consumption in the 19th century. Today\' he is with the first object from the 20th century, a coin that leads Neil to consider the rise of mass political engagement in Britain and the dramatic emergence of suffragette power. It\'s a penny coin from 1903 on which the image of King Edward V11 has been stamped with the words "Votes for Women". The programme explores the rise of women\'s suffrage and the implications of the notorious suffragette protests. The human rights lawyer and reformer Helena Kennedy and the artist Felicity Powell react to this defaced penny coin.Producer: Anthony Denselow. | The history of humanity as told through one hundred objects from the British Museum in London. This week Neil MacGregor, the Director of the Museum, is looking at Europe\'s engagement with the rest of the world during the 18th Century. Today he is with an object "freighted with layers of history, legend, global politics and race relations". It is an aboriginal shield from Australia, originally owned by one of the men to first set eyes on Europeans as they descended on Botany Bay nearly 250 years ago. This remarkably well-preserved object was brought to England by the explorer Captain Cook. What can this object tell us about the early encounter between two such different cultures? Phil Gordon, the aboriginal Heritage Officer at the Australian Museum in Sydney, and the historian Maria Nugent help tell the story. Producer: Anthony Denselow. | The history of humanity - as told through one hundred objects from the British Museum in London - is once again in Japan. This week Neil MacGregor, the museum\'s director, is looking at the global economy in the 19th century - at mass production and mass consumption. Today he is with an image that rapidly made its way around the world - Hokusai\'s print, The Great Wave, the now familiar seascape with a snow topped Mount Fuji in the background that became emblematic of the newly emerging Japan. Neil explores the conditions that produced this famous image - with help from Japan watchers Donald Keene and Christine Guth.Producer: Anthony Denselow. | This week Neil MacGregor\'s history of the world is looking at how the global economy became cemented in the 19th century, a time of mass production and mass consumption. He tells the story of how tea became the defining national drink in Britain - why have we become so closely associated with a brew made from leaves mainly grown in China and India? The object he has chosen to reflect this curious history is an early Victorian tea set, made in Staffordshire and perfectly familiar to all of us. The historian Celina Fox and Monique Simmonds from Kew gardens find new meaning in the ubiquitous cuppa.Producer: Anthony Denselow. | Neil MacGregor\'s history of the world as told through things. Throughout this week he is examining the global economy of the 19th century - of mass production and mass consumption. Today he is with an instrument that first helped Europeans to navigate with precision around the world - a marine chronometer. The one Neil has chosen actually accompanied Darwin on his great voyage to South America and the Galapagos Islands - a journey that was to help lead him to his revolutionary theories on evolution.The geographer Nigel Thrift and the geneticist Steve Jones celebrate the chronometer and the profound changes it prompted.Producer: Anthony Denselow.', 'chan_desc': "Director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, narrates 100 programmes that retell humanity's history through the objects we have made", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/03/06/3b/03063b66-29a9-9e83-5b19-917cde144663/mza_2173007920562927085.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2010-01-18'}}

The monster's history in our mythology and belief systems speaks to the many hidden needs and fears within the human mind. On this episode, we explore why the human mind has always needed monsters, through combat myths, Beowulf, an Egyptian creation myth, Greek tragedy, and more. And in homage to scary monster stories, it opens with a monster-under-the-bed tale I call 'Silver Eyes'.\xa0 \xa0 'Silver Eyes' written by Alyson Horrocks Research Sources:  'Monsters: Evil Beings, Mythical Beasts, and all Manner of Imaginary Terrors' by David D. Gilmore  'On Monsters: An Unnatural History of Our Worst Fears' by Stephen T. Asma \xa0 | Clowns, clowns, clowns! This episode starts off with a dramatized clown urban legend, before exploring the long history of clowning that stretches back to ancient times, with a special emphasis on Joseph Grimaldi, the first modern clown. The fear of clowns is also delved into, as the psychological reasons for this fear is explained, as well as the real-life and fictional examples of those who've inspired it, like John Wayne Gacy, Pennywise, and the clown doll from 'Poltergeist'. The role of the clown in society is analyzed as well, from his appearance in Shakespare's plays down to the killer clown panics that began in the 1980s. Send in the clowns! | The custom of telling winter’s tales is not known to most of us today, but it was custom that stretches back hundreds of years. And more often then not, these winter tales turned to horror.\xa0 The popularity of these winter ghost tales peaked to an all time high during the Victorian era and became a celebrated Christmas tradition. And this entanglement of ghosts and Christmas, ultimately lead to a ghost story becoming the most enduring Christmas tale of all, Charles Dickens, ‘A Christmas Carol’, a story in which the ghosts of past, present, and future, change a man’s life for the better.\xa0 Join The Strange and\xa0Unusual Podcast, as we explore the tradition of winter ghost stories and the reasons they meant to so much to our ancestors, and maybe ought to kept alive today. | A telling of 'The Masque of the Red Death' by Edgar Allan Poe, as well as the conclusion of A Memento Mori Halloween is in this episode. European witch trials, Macbeth, Irish and Scottish traditions, the evolution of Samhain and Halloween, and the Dance of Death is all a part of this fascinating and spooky story. | In this episode, Halloween, and its predecessor Samhain, is explored with the telling of the ghost story 'The Pale Man' and a dive into its evolving history, which includes a look at the Gaelic Celts, The Black Death, Danse Macabre, All Saints and Souls Days, the concept of Memento Mori, and more. | On July 3, 1929, Italian immigrant and occult mystic healer, Benny Evangelist, was beheaded with an ax in his home office. The killer than murdered Benny's sleeping wife, Santina, and their four children upstairs. The murders remain a mystery, but what kind of motivation could inspire such a frenzied and brutal attack? In this episode, we delve into occult practices, magic, folk Catholicism, magical healers, a suicide inspired by fear of the ax killer, Italian folklore, as well as a look at the misconceptions about immigrants at the time, and how that may have affected the case, leaving it a perplexing, eternal mystery. | In the conclusion of this series about the Affair of the Poisons, the increasing accusations against those in King Louis XIV's royal court become more sinister, shocking investigators and the king. With black magic, human sacrifice, witchcraft, priests admitting demonic practices, orgies, love spells and potions, aphrodisiacs, and black masses, this investigation could not have become stranger. (WARNING: sexual function is discussed in this episode, using the actual stories, taken from documents from the time) | In February of 1677 the 'Affair of the Poisons' was launched in Paris, France. And King Louis XIV, who had named himself the Sun King, after the Greek god, Apollo, was being faced with possible poisoning murder attempts within his own royal court, as well as realizing that those within his own circle may have sought the services of the magical underworld of Paris. Fortune-tellers, alchemists, diviners, conjurers, magicians, and those accused of practicing both white and black magic were rounded up, as well as so many who were now being of accused of murder by poison within the highest ranks of Paris. King Louis would be faced with his childhood fear of betrayal and rebellion, all while building up the grand palace of Versailles. For the next several years those practicing magic and those within the Church said to be holding black masses, as well as sacrificing babies and more to the devil, would become the focus of fascination and horror of those within French society. | In 1672, mysterious poisons were found in the home of a recently deceased Frenchman. This discovery would eventually lead to a years-long murder scandal that would come to be known as 'The Affair of the Poisons', and before it done even those in the noble class would be accused of devil worship, human sacrifice, treason, murder and more. In this first part, Mme de Brinvilliers' murder of her father and brothers by poison will be explored, as this was the case that started it all. Also, explored in this episode, in relation to the world view and time period, is alchemy, the philosopher's stone, and the lives of Sir Issac Newton and Nicolas Flamel. | In 1873, three Norwegian women were murdered on the Isles of Shoals, off the coast of New England, by someone they thought they could trust. in this episode, we explore the uncertainty, fear, and the sometimes unfortunate results of trusting real-life wolves in sheep's clothing. Along with an accounting of this murder, the phenomenon is also examined through Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack the Ripper, ax murder, and more.", 'chan_desc': "The unknown. It lies at the root of all fear, and has inspired legends, superstition, folklore, customs, hysteria, and even murder throughout history. Still today we feel the shadowy presence of our ancestors' struggles to explain the mysterious in almost every facet of our lives. Whether it be in the form of religion, urban legends, pop culture, ghost stories, superstitious rituals, and so much more we are still just fighting to keep our monsters in the dark.

The grandmother of theosophy and a world traveller and famed philosopher from the 19th century, Blavatsky started her knowledge journey at a very young age in the library of her grandfather, reading esoteric texts and classic philosophy, which gave her a hunger for more.Blavatsky spent almost a decade of her twenties on an information gathering adventure around the world, examining different cultures and civilisations, uncovering lost texts and tales from dark parts of the globe and she came back with tales of mystic men and ancient religions and beliefs; and the most unbelievable yarns of magic, mystery and even international espionage.Blavatsky's writings were well regarded in the field and new secular spiritual organisations at the time were forming all over the world. Her findings confirmed what they believed and were adopted into the canon of many of these organisations the most famous of which was The Theosophical Society. This was the culmination of the power of these writings and their mission to understand the world through ancient knowledge led to very interesting findings that traditional science only found a century later.Blavatsky became a superstar in this Victorian Spiritual revival in the late 19th century and her speaking tours and private audiences were attended by the good and great of the high spociety in the US and England. The Secret Doctrine became her seminal work and it and others like Isis Unveiled were made essential reading for turn of the century occultists and modern free thinkers alike.---LIVE SHOW in London this Sunday the 6th October with special guest Konstantin Kisin.Get your tickets here before they are all gone!

His book Animal Farm published in 1945 was a scathing indictment of the communist political agenda and was a massive cultural palette cleanser in a world now faced with an ideological dichotomy of socialism versus capitalism. He detested the cult of personality that had grown up around Stalin during the war years and foresaw the problems that lay ahead for the world should this ideological esteem pave the way for a tyrant in absolute control. 1984 was the extension of this critique and the world that was created in this book was based on the tools and methods of totalitarian dictatorships that are now being echoed in the modern media landscape. The oppressive regime depicted in 1984 ring true today with social media deplatformings mimicking the actions of Winston Smith working for the Ministry of Truth and the Thought Police and blatant propaganda tactics shown in the actions of politically charged social media platforms.I chat with Sam and XG about the man himself, Orwell's journey to writing 1984 and some of the more important warnings Orwell writes about that are showing themselves in the modern political discourse. DoubleThink, NewSpeak, and The Memory Hole are all terms often used when talking about cultural and political debate online these days; and Orwell saw it all happening in 1949! Enjoy this chat anyway and let me know what you think. Ill be uploading this to the main podcast for the next 30 days but I will definitely be doing a George Orwell episode in the future on TCG, a big one! :)---You can find Sam here: https://twitter.com/samtripoli and the Tin Foil Hat Podcast here: https://twitter.com/TinFoilHatCast or check out all their good stuff on their website here: https://tinfoilhatpodcast.com ---Get tickets to the TCG LIVE SHOW in Bush Hall, London, England on 6th October 2019 from this link http://bit.ly/London-Oct19-Gig-Tickets :) Tickets go live on Friday so make sure you get in there before they are gone.

We take facts for granted, but they represent an invaluable intellectual technology less than 400 years old, which was forged in a fight between two of history’s brightest thinkers battling over the best way to rescue their society from the madness of medieval barbarism. \xa0 There is a book that gives us a front row seat to that fight:\xa0Leviathan and the Air Pump, published by the historians of science Steve Shapin and Simon Schaffer. It covers the\xa0conflict between the Scientific Revolutionaries Thomas Hobbes and Robert Boyle concerning how new knowledge could and should be created, and out of which the concept of an objective fact as we now know it was born.\xa0 Visit my Patreon page to access bonus episodes and all regular episodes ad-free.\xa0 Learn more at bradharris.com. | Today I'm speaking with Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen, a historian from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. It would be hard to find a scholar better equipped to enhance our historical perspective on how we decide what's true. Jennifer and I challenge each other's thinking on several questions, including:\xa0 Were Enlightenment ideas about natural rights discovered or created? Does the distinction between objective truth and pragmatic truth really matter? How do we reconcile timeless values with scientific disruption? To explore these ideas further, I recommend two of Jennifer's books: The Ideas That Made America and American Nietzsche.

The book sold millions of copies, becoming a powerful weapon in Bloom's fight against what he identified as a morally and intellectually crippling form of relativism infecting America's educational system. Allan Bloom sought to remind us that the goal of education is not to become open to all ideas, but to cultivate the search for the best ideas.

This is the idea that conversation, that argument, that free expression\xa0represent the best path to progress and to justice for all, and that to institutionalize this idea via a Constitutional right to the freedom of speech is the best way to preserve a prosperous society.

In Why the West Rules - For Now, Ian Morris counters that if we look beyond the facade of culture to how human biology, sociology, and geography interact, it is possible to discover a fundamental pattern in history to help us answer the biggest historical questions, from why the West rules for now, to what will happen next.

Although this counter-narrative can illuminate intellectual developments of Late Antiquity, it verges on cultural relativism that threatens to obscure real differences in how people flourish or suffer.

Increasing numbers of Chinese began to arrive on the West Coast of the United States, drawn by the California Gold Rush and seeking new economic opportunities to support their extended families back in China.\xa0 Soon, however, American economic conditions began to take on racist overtones, as public opinion began to turn against the Chinese.\xa0 In this episode, we look at the history of Chinese immigration to the United States, its increasing legal restrictions, and the long-term consequences of the Page Act of 1875 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.Further ReadingKil Young Zo,\xa0Chinese Emigration into the United States, 1850-1880 (Arno, 1978).Sucheng Chan, ed.\xa0\xa0Entry Denied: Exclusion and the Chinese Community in America, 1882-1943\xa0(Temple University Press, 1991).Judy Yung,\xa0Unbound Feet: A Social History of Chinese Women in San Francisco\xa0(University of California Press, 1995).Andrew Gyory,\xa0Closing the Gate: Race, Politics, and the Chinese Exclusion Act\xa0(University of North Carolina Press, 1998).George Anthony Peffer,\xa0If They Don\'t Bring Their Women Here: Chinese Female Immigration Before Exclusion\xa0(University of Illinois Press, 1999).Karen Leong, "\'A Distant and Antagonistic Race\': Constructions of Chinese Manhood in the Exclusionist Debates," in\xa0Across the Great Divide: Cultures of Manhood in the Amerian West.\xa0 Ed.

When he re-crossed the Atlantic in 1826, he was a free man who also went by the name Newport Gardner. In between, he was a composer, a teacher, a small-business owner, and a prominent member of Newport, Rhode Island Free African community. In this episode, Kristin follows the remarkable journey of the man, who bought his freedom and returned to Africa, known as both Occramer Marycoo and Newport Gardner.\xa0\xa0 | (Lucy)\xa0Ache in the head, running of the nose, and the throat being pierced by pain like a spear: medieval descriptions of common ailments are often familiar, as well as startlingly vivid. This podcast episode looks at everyday remedies in medieval Europe. From chicken and barley to spiced wine, many such remedies were delicious and nutritious. Administering medicine — from comfort food to careful concoctions — was based on both education and experience. | (Christine and Elizabeth) In April 2019, a fire at the French cathedral Notre-Dame de Paris had people around the world glued to their news feeds and televisions. Join Christine and Elizabeth for a discussion about some significant events that took place at Notre-Dame during one of France’s most turbulent periods, the span from the French Revolution to the exile of Napoleon III. | (Lesley)\xa0Of all the wars in the 20th century, no loss was more frustrating than the military operation against the emu in Western Australia in 1932.

It was said to be able to cure everything from migraines to the plague. In this episode, Kristin looks at some of the ingredients and processes that went into making theriac, where it could be found, who was selling it, and whether there was anything behind its extraordinary claims. | (Nathan)\xa0The landscape of the Christian afterlife has never been static, and over the last 2,000 years, the theology of what the hereafter looks like has evolved drastically.

An important contributor to the fledgling American government, Goddard\'s name should be better known for politics, journalism, and revolution. | (Kristin) King John is often remembered as one of England’s most inept and disliked rulers. By the time he was forced to sign the Magna Carta in 1215, John lost authority, territory, and a lot of friends. Some, however, did remain loyal.

Valerie was flung against the roof and doors, causing brain damage, epilepsy and debilitating migraines. She was then prescribed a staggering range of pharmaceuticals to deal with the aftermath, but they proved largely ineffective in stopping her convulsions and grand mal seizures. And the side-effects left her a zombie. Then her husband Mike read about a government-funded research paper that showed unique compounds found in cannabis can reverse the growth of cancerous tumors and help control laboratory-induced seizures.\xa0 What happened next is a story of resistance and resilience that involved an iconic weed garden, an armed police raid, a barricade of cannabis patients in wheelchairs and walkers, and a standoff on the steps of City Hall pitting the Wo/men\'s Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM) against the DEA.

Fusing their comedic super powers in a crucible fueled by love for weed and improv, Cheech and Chong grew from performing in between burlesque acts, to Grammy-nominated comedians, leaving one world left to conquer: Hollywood.Up in Smoke may not be the first ever stoner comedy, but it’s the one thatchanged popular entertainment forever. And if you’re asking yourself “How Did This GetMade?,” rest assured that it happened in the most Cheech and Chong way possible.And Abdullah and Bean try to piece together the many ways that Up in Smoke predicted the future, despite having a plot that barely makes sense.LISTENING NOTE: Roll up a comically oversized joint for this episode! | What would happen if one of the biggest heroes and one of the biggest villains in professional wrestling got arrested for smoking a joint together?Just ask babyface "Hacksaw" Jim Duggan and legendary heel The Iron Sheik. In 1987, that very fate befell two of the WWF\'s biggest stars. The aftermath of those shocking arrests not only changed the trajectory of both their lives forever, it also forever transformed pro wrestling in ways the sport is still grappling with. Also in this episode, we learn how the Iron Sheik fled his homeland of Iran in fear that the Shah—who came to power thanks to a CIA-back coup—was about to assassinate him.And we chart how a first-generation viral video attacking Seinfeld star Michael Richards for racist comments gave the Iron Sheik a third act as an online heel and a Howard Stern show favorite.

We did, so we dug deep into Barry\'s time with his high school weed crew, the Choom Gang.“In Hawaii, chooming means indulging in pakalolo,” fellow Choom Gang member Tom Topolinski explains to Frontline. And yes, pakalolo is yet another slang term for cannabis, as heard in Hawaiian musician Don Ho’s classic song, “Who Is the Lolo Who Stole My Pakalolo?”You might remember seeing this young version of Obama portrayed by Jordan Peele in a classic Key and Peele sketch. The former president famously admitted that he used cannabis as a youth and that he surely inhaled as “that was the point.” Though he opposed cannabis legalization as a senator, his public stance evolved over the course of his tenure, and his direction to federal authorities to lay off state-level efforts to legalize cannabis makes him the most progressive president on the cannabis issue to date. Some say it’s just good policy, but we say it calls for a special shout-out to the Choom Gang.Check out our friends and sponsors, who helped make this episode possible: Camino Gummies | Great Moments in Weed History is back for season 2!

And so begins our Season 1 finale, in which we explore one of the most iconic smoke sessions of all time. | Dennis Peron (1945-2018) first discovered the healing power of cannabis while serving in Vietnam. After smuggling two pounds of high-grade herb home from the front, he became a charismatic and defiant leader of San Francisco\'s medical cannabis and gay rights movements. A fiery street-fighting optimist, he suffered multiple stints in prison and even took a bullet in a police raid—all without ever giving up or backing down. | Amsterdam has long been a safe haven for cannabis freedom, but few today remember the subversive, anarchistic, defiantly pro weed Dutch Provo movement (short for provocateurs), which used a mix of radical street theater and outrageous political pranks to expose the authorities as out of touch and incompetent, while bringing coffeeshops, seed banks, and legal cannabis to the Netherlands. | Mary Jane Rathbun was already selling weed brownies in San Francisco when the AIDS crisis hit. So the self described "little old lady" started volunteering at hospitals and crisis centers, where she made her "magically delicious" treats available for free to those in desperate need.

He petitioned for the rights of wealthy free men of color – a class distinct from free Black slaves – but he upheld the institution of slavery. Ogé was not a revolutionary, and it’s hard to know the degree to which self-preservation, internalized racism and white supremacy, classism, ego, and compassion informed his decisions, separately. But his activism and sensationalized execution set the stage for the extension of rights to free men of color and heralded the uprising of enslaved people in Saint-Domingue.\xa0\xa0His resistance isn’t a model to follow to a T. It was exclusionary and executed at the expense of more marginalized and mistreated people, under the specific circumstances of that time.

Throughout the book, Dr. Gloyn reveals the trends behind how we have used the monsters, and develops a broad theory of the ancient monster and its life after antiquity, investigating its relation to gender, genre and space to explore what it is that keeps drawing us back to these mythical beasts and why they have remained such a powerful presence in our shared cultural imagination. Specifically, her book takes us through a comprehensive tour of monsters on film and television, from the much-loved creations of Ray Harryhausen in\xa0Clash of the Titans\xa0to the monster of the week in\xa0Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, before examining in detail the post-classical afterlives of the two most popular monsters, the Medusa and the Minotaur.\xa0 Show Notes:\xa0http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2019/10/special-guest-episode-on-classical.html \xa0 Dr Liz Gloyn Senior Lecturer at Royal Holloway, University of London Website: https://lizgloyn.wordpress.com/ Twitter:\xa0https://twitter.com/lizgloyn \xa0 \xa0 | In this episode, we discuss the years 423-421 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including\xa0the death of Artaxerxes and the succession struggle that ends with Darius II on the Persian throne; the continuation of Brasidas\' Thracian and Macedonian campaign; the ‘Wasps’ and ‘Peace’ by Aristophanes; and the deaths of Brasidas and Kleon during the second battle of Amphipolis, culminating in the “Peace of Nikias” and the end of the Archidamian War Show Notes:\xa0http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2019/09/097-road-to-peace.html \xa0 Intro by Samuel Hume of Pax Brittanica\xa0 Website:\xa0https://paxbritannica.info Facebook:\xa0https://www.facebook.com/PodBritannica/ Twitter:https://twitter.com/samuelhume10\xa0and\xa0https://twitter.com/BritannicaPax \xa0 | In this episode, we discuss the years 425 and 424 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including the conclusion of the First Sicilian Expedition and the Congress of Gela, the Athenian seizure of Kythera, the Battles of Megara and Delium, and the beginning of Brasidas\' Thracian campaign Show Notes:\xa0http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2019/09/096-athens-on-offensive.html \xa0 Intro by SandRhoman YouTube:\xa0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7pr_dQxm2Ns2KlzRSx5FZA Facebook:\xa0https://www.facebook.com/SandRhoman/ Twitter:\xa0https://twitter.com/Sandrhoman \xa0 | In this episode, we discuss the years 426 and 425 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including the current nature of Athenian politics as dominated by Kleon the anti-aristocratic demagogue, his feud with  Aristophanes as seen in the comedic plays "The Acharnians" and "The Knights", the Battles of Pylos and Sphacteria that turned the Greek world upside down, and the brutal conclusion to the Corcyraean civil war Show Notes:\xa0http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2019/08/095-greek-world-turned-upside-down.html \xa0 Intro by David Cot of the History of Spain Podcast Website:\xa0https://thehistoryofspain.com Facebook:\xa0https://www.facebook.com/thehistoryofspain/ Twitter:\xa0https://twitter.com/podcast_spain \xa0 Today’s episode is also brought to you by our new May, June, and July 2019 Patreon supporters Ryan O, Kathy Chapman, Nicholas Campbell, and Even Einride Hennum Kleiven, as well as PayPal donors Peter Levis and Dale Cooke.

We had featured the Squirrel Cage Jail in Ep. 284, but this would be the first time we would actually get to go inside and tour the building. But we did more than just tour this location.

He’d been bumping up against the limits of how far the Mattachine Society was willing to challenge the status quo. And when the Stonewall uprising blew things wide open, Craig grabbed the reins and never looked back. | Stonewall turned the page on the homophile movement. Pre-Stonewall activists like Barbara Gittings and Kay Lahusen were dinosaurs in the eyes of some of the gay liberationists, and they found themselves fighting\xa0 for a place in the new chapter of LGBTQ history that unfolded after the riots.\xa0 | Nineteen-year-old Columbia University student Morty Manford thought it was just another night at the Stonewall Inn, but then the police swept in and the raid was on.\xa0 Morty shared his memories of that night with Eric Marcus in this archival interview from 1989. \xa0 | A rebroadcast of Eric’s 1989 interview with Marsha P. Johnson and Randy Wicker. Hear conflicting perspectives on Stonewall from this pair of unlikely roommates. Marsha co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries after Stonewall; Randy had led the way in the earlier homophile movement. | What made Stonewall different? How can we carry the lessons of the uprising with us today? Eric is joined by one archivist \xa0 and four activists to answer those questions in an intergenerational conversation recorded live at the Stonewall Inn on May 23, 2019. | Like so many other acts of queer resistance, the riots in Greenwich Village in late June and early July 1969 could have become a footnote in history. But the protests and organizing that followed the Stonewall Uprising turned the page. A new chapter had begun in the fight for LGBTQ civil rights. With exclusive archival audio from the year after Stonewall, we'll explore how queer anger found a voice with “Gay Power” and how joy propelled the first pride marches. Out of the closet and into the streets! | At 1:20 a.m. on June 28, 1969, the New York City police raided the Stonewall Inn, an unlicensed gay club in New York’s Greenwich Village. I wasn’t there.\xa0 Of these two facts I feel certain.\xa0 The first one, because the police report from that night states the time that the police entered the Stonewall Inn.\xa0 And the second, because I was ten years old at the time and didn’t see Greenwich Village for the first time until I’d graduated from Hillcrest High School in Queens, New York, in June 1976. (I’m shocked now by what an incurious teenager I was back then.)But there’s plenty about the raid on the Stonewall Inn and the subsequent uprising that’s less certain and often the focus of disagreements and heated debate.\xa0 I like to think that the story of Stonewall is big enough for all the recollections and memories and inevitable myths that have taken shape in the five decades since Stonewall became a key turning point in the history of the LGBTQ civil rights movement and the birthplace of the “gay liberation” phase of the fight for equality.So in this second episode of our special Stonewall 50 season, we’re bringing you multiple voices—and multiple and often conflicting memories—from people who were inside and outside the Stonewall Inn a half-century ago.\xa0 Voices drawn from my three-decade-old archive and from other archival audio unearthed by Making Gay History’s team of archive rats—including some tape dating back to the first year after the raid. \xa0Have a listen and decide which memories ring true for you. | Conflict has context. In this first episode of Making Gay History’s Stonewall 50 season, we hear stories from the pre-Stonewall struggle for LGBTQ rights. We travel back in time to hear voices from the turbulent 1960s and take you to the tinderbox that was Greenwich Village on the eve of an uprising.\xa0 If you’d like a primer on Stonewall, here is a handy factsheet that Making Gay History co-produced. The final page has more resources if you’d like to dig a bit deeper.To find out more about some of the people featured in this episode and the times in which they lived, check out the following Making Gay History episodes and the accompanying episode notes: Frank Kameny, Barbara Gittings and Kay Lahusen (part 1 and part 2), Randy Wicker and Marsha P. Johnson, Ernestine Eckstein, and Sylvia Rivera (part 1 and part 2).\xa0 Craig Rodwell will be featured more extensively in upcoming episodes, but he also makes an appearance in our episode about Dick Leitsch, with whom Craig Rodwell was in a relationship during their early days at Mattachine.Many of our previous episodes include interviews with LGBTQ trailblazers who became active in the movement pre-Stonewall.\xa0 To learn more about the founders of some of the early U.S. homophile organizations, have a listen to our episodes with Harry Hay, founder of the Mattachine Society; Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, co-founders of the Daughters of Bilitis; and Dorr Legg, Martin Block, and Jim Kepner, who spearheaded ONE. | A special season of Making Gay History to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising. Hear the voices of the rioters, and of the activists who turned a riot into Gay Liberation—a new and expansive phase in the LGBTQ rights movement. | Brooklyn-born Martha Shelley was a rebel. She didn’t like being told what to do, wear, or say. She hated the lesbian bars, and after joining the Daughters of Bilitis she strained against the self-imposed limits of the homophile movement. Coming of age in the 1960s, she was ready for revolution.Learn more about Martha Shelley in this interview for the website “Stonewall: Riot, Rebellion, Activism, and Identity” (the audio file is embedded at the bottom of the transcript page).\xa0 Martha’s oral history is included in Eric Marcus’s book Making History.In this episode, Martha mentions how the FBI monitored DOB's activities.\xa0 To see samples of their investigative work, check out the declassified files collected on this webpage.Martha Shelley was one of the participants in the July 4th Annual Reminders, picket lines organized by homophile organizations from 1965 to 1969 at Philadelphia’s Independence Hall.\xa0 You can see footage of the 1968 Annual Reminder in “The Second Largest Minority,” a short documentary by Lilli Vincenz, here.Martha Shelley has written fiction and poetry, and her short stories, essays, and poems have appeared in numerous anthologies, including Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women's Liberation Movement, edited by Robin Morgan.\xa0 You can hear Martha discuss her novel The Throne in the Heart of the Sea on Portland radio station KBOO here.", 'chan_desc': 'Intimate, personal portraits of both known and long-forgotten champions, heroes, and witnesses to history brought to you from rare archival interviews.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/cf/61/a1/cf61a162-5f48-aedf-a558-dbeb75051ed2/mza_3880136673556726408.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2016-10-05'}}

He’d come to the house to partake in a séance, invited by a woman known only as Mrs X whom in their communications leading up to the night, had guaranteed a spirit manifestation for him.

A rebel against the Anglo-Norman rule, he had been sentenced to death on 13 counts of Homicide. Now it was time for him to meet his maker.

Her parents collected her, took her home and lived with her for several weeks before a body showed up just 800 metres from their house. The body alone was shocking enough, but quickly became doubly so as it was identified as the body of the lost & found Pauline.SOURCES:‘Whose Child?’ (1922, May 27), The Pall Mall Gazette, London.

This one way communication with history is always limited by it’s very definition and no matter how much we dig, we can never ask the writers what were they feeling as they wrote each line, and whilst we judge them by the information they give, we can never invite them to ask what they make of the people and things of today in our alien, modern world. In 1984, an Economics teacher living in the small rural village of Dodleston found he had the opportunity to do exactly this, when he was thrust into a strange link that tied him across centuries with a past inhabitant of his home via an early model personal computer and it’s word processing software EDWORD. Both accused the other of trickery, poltergeist activity, witchcraft and devilry, but eventually, a bond between the two was formed. Cross-century communications are never easy, however, especially when the future gets involved.To take part in the review drive mentioned in the show, send your screenshots to social@darkhistories.comSOURCES:Webster, K.

There were some however, that did manage to achieve the feat, whether it be through cool calculation, or dumb luck, there was always opportunity for the enthusiastic murderer willing to think outside the box. In Canada during the mid-19th Century, one man, William Turner managed to commit and get away with murder, either through dumb luck, due to an unlikely double being framed for the crime, or through an incredible talent for acting. After more than 150 years, the question has always remained, which was it?

In this week\'s episode of the Futility Closet podcast we\'ll describe Czapski\'s ambitious project and the surprising importance of literature to the prisoners of oppressive regimes. We\'ll also race some lemons and puzzle over a woman\'s birthdays. Intro: A piano keyboard can be used as a calendar mnemonic. After the Civil War, thousands of Confederates settled in Brazil.

Thanks for listening! |  In 1855 a band of London thieves set their sights on a new target: the South Eastern Railway, which carried gold bullion to the English coast. The payoff could be enormous, but the heist would require meticulous planning. In this week\'s episode of the Futility Closet podcast we\'ll tell the story of the first great train robbery, one of the most audacious crimes of the 19th century. We\'ll also jump into the record books and puzzle over a changing citizen. Intro: British birdwatcher Chris Watson discovered Scottish starlings memorializing forgotten farm machinery.

Two months had passed since his adopted father, Julius Caesar, was murdered by members of the senate who resented his control as dictator. Octavian stood to inherit Caesar’s fortunes, but few could have imagined that he would inherit Caesar’s power.He would become emperor in 27BCE, reigning as the Augustus and transforming the republic of Rome into an autocratic principate. Under his leadership of forty years Rome would grow in territory, reputation, economy and culture, and change from a city of sun-dried bricks and leave it clothed in marble. How did the young Octavian transform himself into Rome's first emperor?Sponsored by the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, La Trobe University. Held at the Wheeler Centre in Melbourne on 23 September, 2019.Guest: Associate Professor Rhiannon Evans (Classics and Ancient History, La Trobe University) | The Vestals were an order of priestesses who were sacred to Rome, and were respected and referred as symbols of a safe and stable empire. They had the all-important duty of maintaining the sacred flame, and if it were extinguished, it would be a sign of impending disaster.Guest: Dr Peta Greenfield (Public Historian, co-host of 'The Partial Historians' podcast) | Elagabalus has long been remembered as deviant and sexually depraved. His behaviour was shocking for a Roman citizen, let alone the leader of the empire, and Rome was relieved to see the end of him.Guest: Dr Caillan Davenport (Senior Lecturer, Roman History, Macquarie University/Humboldt Research Fellow, Goethe University, Frankfurt) | When Elagabalus finally reached Rome, the city seemed to hold its breath. The young Emperor embraced both the roles of ruler and high priest of a foreign religion, and there were many that questioned where his priorities lie.Guest: Dr Caillan Davenport (Senior Lecturer, Roman History, Macquarie University/Humboldt Research Fellow, Goethe University, Frankfurt) | Macrinus has made a treaty with the Parthians and at long last, the two mighty empires are at peace. It likely won’t last, but at this point it matters little: now he can finally get down to the business of ruling the empire.Guest: Dr Caillan Davenport (Senior Lecturer, Roman History, Macquarie University/Humboldt Research Fellow, Goethe University, Frankfurt) | With the murder of Caracalla one of the most unlikely men steps into power. Macrinus is unassuming, of the wrong position, and the wrong class. He’d argue he’s the best man for the job, but very few in Rome would agree with him. Guest: Dr Caillan Davenport (Senior Lecturer, Roman History, Macquarie University) | Assassination was a regular occurrence in the right Roman circles, and the gossip around the senate floor must have frequently turned to who's knifing who. An emperor would need to keep the senate, the army, and the people on side, or risk a well-placed dagger.Guest: Dr Rhiannon Evans (Senior Lecturer, Classics and Ancient History, La Trobe University) | By modern standards the Romans had some fairly unusual ideas, which could be putting it mildly when it comes to the subject of adultery. For the most part the Romans were lack lax in repercussions, unless of course you were embarrassing a man of high status.Guest: Dr Rhiannon Evans (Senior Lecturer, Classics and Ancient History, La Trobe University) | While we are lucky that much Roman literature from the late republic and the imperial period comes down to us complete or almost complete, most of the historical and poetic works from the mid-republic have been lost and only survive in fragments.Guest: Dr Hannah Čulík-Baird (Assistant Professor, Classical Studies, Boston University) | The Roman calendar was important to the civic management of Rome - it told when to plant and harvest crops, when to celebrate festivals and when to go to war. The calendar designed by the Romans is used today, more or less unchanged for 2000 years - including paying homage to both Julius Caesar and Augustus.Guest: Dr Rhiannon Evans (Senior Lecturer, Classics and Ancient History, La Trobe University)", 'chan_desc': '“Great empires are not maintained by timidity.” - Tacitus.

He found his first major success with his Gypsy Ballads, although Dali, once his close friend, mocked him for these, accusing Lorca of being too conservative.  He preferred performing his poems to publishing them, and his plays marked a revival in Spanish theatre.  He was captured and killed by Nationalist forces at the start of the Civil War, his body never recovered, and it\'s been suggested this was punishment for his politics and for being openly gay.  He has since been seen as the most important Spanish playwright and poet of the last century.WithMaria DelgadoProfessor of Creative Arts at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, University of LondonFederico BonaddioReader in Modern Spanish at King’s College LondonAndSarah WrightProfessor of Hispanic Studies and Screen Arts at Royal Holloway, University of LondonProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the range, depth and style of Browne (1605-82) , a medical doctor whose curious mind drew him to explore and confess his own religious views, challenge myths and errors in science and consider how humans respond to the transience of life.  His Religio Medici became famous throughout Europe and his openness about his religion, in that work, was noted as rare when others either kept quiet or professed orthodox views. His Pseudodoxia Epidemica challenged popular ideas, whether about the existence of mermaids or if Adam had a navel, and his Hydriotaphia or Urn Burial was a meditation on what matters to humans when handling the dead. In 1923, Virginia Woolf wrote, "Few people love the writings of Sir Thomas Browne, but those that do are the salt of the earth."  He also contributed more words to the English language than almost anyone, such as electricity, indigenous, medical, ferocious, carnivorous ambidextrous and migrant.With Claire PrestonProfessor of Renaissance Literature at Queen Mary University of LondonJessica WolfeProfessor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of North Carolina at Chapel HillAndKevin KilleenProfessor of English at the University of YorkProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Mary Shelley\'s (1797-1851) Gothic story of a Swiss natural philosopher, Victor Frankenstein, and the creature he makes from parts of cadavers and which he then abandons, horrified by his appearance, and never names. Rejected by all humans who see him, the monster takes his revenge on Frankenstein, killing those dear to him. Shelley started writing Frankenstein when she was 18, prompted by a competition she had with Byron and her husband Percy Shelley to tell a ghost story while they were rained in in the summer of 1816 at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva.The image of Mary Shelley, above, was first exhibited in 1840.WithKaren O\'BrienProfessor of English Literature at the University of OxfordMichael RossingtonProfessor of Romantic Literature at Newcastle UniversityAnd Jane ThomasProfessor of Victorian and Early 20th Century Literature at the University of HullProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of Shakespeare\'s most popular works, written c1595 in the last years of Elizabeth I. It is a comedy of love and desire and their many complications as well as their simplicity, and a reflection on society\'s expectations and limits. It is also a quiet critique of Elizabeth and her vulnerability and on the politics of the time, and an exploration of the power of imagination.With Helen HackettProfessor of English Literature and Leverhulme Research Fellow at University College LondonTom HealyProfessor of Renaissance Studies at the University of Sussexand Alison FindlayProfessor of Renaissance Drama at Lancaster University and Chair of the British Shakespeare AssociationProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life and works of Hopkins (1844-89), a Jesuit priest who at times burned his poems and at others insisted they should not be published.  His main themes are how he, nature and God relate to each other. His friend Robert Bridges preserved Hopkins\' poetry and, once printed in 1918, works such as The Windhover, Pied Beauty and As Kingfishers Catch Fire were celebrated for their inventiveness and he was seen as a major poet, perhaps the greatest of the Victorian age. WithCatherine PhillipsR J Owens Fellow in English at Downing College, University of CambridgeJane WrightSenior Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Bristoland Martin DuboisAssistant Professor in Nineteenth Century Literature at Durham UniversityProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life, works, context and legacy of Antarah (525-608AD), the great poet and warrior.  According to legend, he was born a slave; his mother was an Ethiopian slave, his father an elite Arab cavalryman.  Antarah won his freedom in battle and loved a woman called Abla who refused him, and they were later celebrated in the saga of Antar and Abla. One of Antarah\'s poems was so esteemed in pre-Islamic Arabia that it is believed it was hung up on the wall of the Kaaba in Mecca. With James MontgomerySir Thomas Adams\'s Professor of Arabic at the University of CambridgeMarlé HammondSenior Lecturer in Arabic Popular Literature and Culture at SOAS, University of LondonAnd Harry MuntLecturer in Medieval History at the University of YorkProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss how artists from the Middle Ages onwards have been inspired by the Bible story of the widow who killed an Assyrian general who was besieging her village, and so saved her people from his army and from his master Nebuchadnezzar.  A symbol of a woman\'s power and the defiance of political tyranny, the image of Judith has been sculpted by Donatello, painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and, in the case of Caravaggio, Liss and Artemisia Gentileschi, been shown with vivid, disturbing detail.  What do these interpretations reveal of the attitudes to power and women in their time, and of the artists\' own experiences? The image of Judith, above is from a tapestry in the Duomo, Milan, by Giovanni or Nicola Carcher, 1555With Susan FoisterCurator of Early Netherlandish, German and British Painting at the National GalleryJohn GashSenior Lecturer in History of Art at the University of AberdeenAnd Ela Nutu HallResearch Associate at the Sheffield Institute for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies, at the University of SheffieldProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Samuel Beckett (1906 - 1989), who lived in Paris and wrote his plays and novels in French, not because his French was better than his English, but because it was worse.  In works such as Waiting for Godot, Endgame, Molloy and Malone Dies, he wanted to show the limitations of language, what words could not do, together with the absurdity and humour of the human condition.  In part he was reacting to the verbal omnipotence of James Joyce, with whom he’d worked in Paris, and in part to his experience in the French Resistance during World War 2, when he used code, writing not to reveal meaning but to conceal it.WithSteven ConnorProfessor of English at the University of CambridgeLaura SalisburyProfessor of Modern Literature at the University of ExeterAnd Mark NixonAssociate Professor in Modern Literature at the University of Reading and co-director of the Beckett International FoundationProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the jewels of medieval English poetry.  It was written c1400 by an unknown poet and then was left hidden in private collections until the C19th when it emerged.  It tells the story of a giant green knight who disrupts Christmas at Camelot, daring Gawain to cut off his head with an axe if he can do the same to Gawain the following year.  Much to the surprise of Arthur\'s court, who were kicking the green head around, the decapitated body reaches for his head and rides off, leaving Gawain to face his promise and his apparently inevitable death the following Christmas.The illustration above is ©British Library Board Cotton MS Nero A.x, article 3, ff.94v95With Laura AsheProfessor of English Literature at Worcester College, University of OxfordAd PutterProfessor of Medieval English Literature at the University of BristolAnd Simon ArmitagePoet and Professor of Poetry at the Universities of Leeds and OxfordProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Horace (65-8BC), who flourished under the Emperor Augustus. He was one of the greatest poets of his age and is one of the most quoted of any age. Carpe diem, nil desperandum, nunc est bibendum – that’s Horace. He was the son of a freedman from southern Italy and, thanks to his talent, achieved high status in Rome despite fighting on the losing side in the civil wars. His Odes are widely thought his most enduring works, yet he also wrote his scurrilous Epodes, some philosophical Epistles and broad Satires. He’s influenced poets ever since, including those such as Wilfred Owen who rejected his line: ‘dulce et decorum est pro patria mori’.With Emily GowersProfessor of Latin Literature at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of St John’s CollegeWilliam FitzgeraldProfessor of Latin Language and Literature at King’s College Londonand Ellen O’GormanSenior Lecturer in Classics at the University of BristolProducer: Simon Tillotson', 'chan_desc': 'Popular culture, poetry, music and visual arts and the roles they play in our society.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/f2/f3/cd/f2f3cdb0-7167-5953-4895-679023139776/mza_1290080790030539105.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '1998-11-12'}}

Jesus had delivered an apocaplytic sermon at the mount the day before. According to the gospel of John, Jesus serenely accepts his fate, and refuses to ask his Father to save him. The synoptic gospels challenge that. In those gospels, Jesus lashes out at his disciples. As the company return from the Mount through the Garden of Gethsamene, Jesus asks his Father to save him from death. Jesus is arrested at the Garden and sent for trial. The gospels can't get their story straight about the trials. Was Jesus tried by the Jewish Council? Was he just interrogated, but not tried, by the high priest? Was he sent to Herod Antipas? Was he taken before Pilate once or twice? The gospels disagree. One thing that the gospels furiously agree upon is in exonerating the Roman prefect, and dumping all the blame on the Jews. | After Jesus has resurrected Lazarus, he briefly flies to Ephraim, outside of Judea, for fear of the Jews. He quickly regains his confidence, and returns to Bethany, and the home of Lazarus. From there he moves to Jerusalem to participate in the annual Passover. In Jerusalem, he and his disciples partake in a final meal. Judas betrays Jesus. The gospel of John disagrees with the synoptics as to the dating of the Last Supper: the day of Passover, or the day before? John uses the supper to introduce a bunch of theology. He also introduces the mysterious Beloved Disciple, and a new divine entity, the Paraclete. | The Passion story story begins with Jesus in Bethany, a suburb of Jerusalem. Jesus is staying with his best buddies Martha, Mary, and the risen Lazarus. Jesus arranges with his students to organise a grand parade for his entry into the capital. That goes swimmingly. Ebullient from his grand reception, Jesus marches into the Temple, determined to destroy its commercial activities. Jesus then delivers a little apocalypse at the Mount of Olives. | The notion of the Trinity is one of -- if not the -- most difficult concepts in Christian theology. Steve Guerra and I plough through centuries of Jewish and Christian thought to try to make sense of it. Part two of two. | As so often, the synoptic gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke tell a different story of the third and final act of Jesus' life compared to the gospel of John. In the gospel of John, Jesus spends six months in Judea before his death, and is attacked by the authorities because he raised Lazarus from the dead. John has Jesus deliver a series of confusing speeches about his relationship with God. Against John, the synoptic gospels assert that Jesus spent a few weeks traveling to Judea, and only a week in the city. | This is a bonus episode for season two.

The conference was organised by Roifield Brown, producer of numerous podcasts: How Jamaica Conquered the World, and The Things That Made England, amongst others. Roifield was the man who introduced me to history podcasting. | After the Big Three disciples come the forgettable bit-players, the Nondescript Nine: Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew (also known as Nathaniel), Matthew, Thomas Didymus, James son of Alphaeus, Judas (also known as Thaddaeus), Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot. | The notion of the Trinity is one of -- if not the -- most difficult concepts in Christian theology. Steve Guerra and I plough through centuries of Jewish and Christian thought to try to make sense of it. Part one of two. | Jesus had an inner cabinet of three disciples: Simon Peter; and James and John, the sons of Zebedee. Only they have significant speaking parts. The often appear together at many significant moments, such as the Transfiguration. The rest of the disciples are ciphers. Peter is by far the pre-eminent disciple, named more often in the New Testament all the other disciples put together. He is Jesus’ devoted wombat, an impulsive, exuberant, and eminently likeable individual. But he fails when put to the test. A work attributed to him, the Apocalypse of Peter, provided all our modern images of hell. Western church fathers held that the disciple John wrote the gospel of that name, Revelation, and three letters. The Eastern church and modern scholars are dubious. James was the first disciple to be martyred, by Herod Agrippa. He is memorialised at the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. | Jesus' mission to Galilee does not go as well as hoped. The Pharisees and scribes attack him for teaching and working wonders on the sabbath. Jesus spars with the Jewish factions many times. Jesus attacks the Pharisees for their petty legalism. Modern interpretations of these accounts hold them to reflect the situation when the gospels were written, projected back into the time of Jesus. Jesus' Galilean ministry concludes with his Transfiguration, where he stands between Moses and Elijah, and the voice of God again declares that Jesus is his son.", 'chan_desc': "A layman's guide to a 150 years of research into the history presented in the Bible.

In this Part 1 episode Laszlo gives some background into the historical developments that led to the rise of, who some call, the first warlord, Yuan Shikai. | In this episode Laszlo introduces one of the great military heroes of the Ming Dynasty. Though rather well-known to Chinese who went through the public school systems of Greater China, little is known of him elsewhere. Qi Jiguang helped to rid the China coast of pirates (Wōkòu) and through his epic Great Wall restoration engineering project he kept the Mongol menace at bay and preserved the Ming Dynasty for an additional half century. His two military treatises were required reading into modern times and he contributed greatly to the introduction of Chinese martial arts into the military as a training regimen. | In this special CHP episode produced in partnership with the 21st Century China Center at the University of California-San Diego, I am honored and privileged to host a discussion with the three editors of the new book "China Tripping - Experiencing the Everyday in the People\'s Republic."

In this Part 1 episode we will focus on the one who made it all possible, the talented Li Jinhui.

Credit: Martin Ngugi / Getty Images) | All over the world there are people rejecting the society they live in and choosing radically different pathways. Some are abandoning the idea of a ‘family house’ in favour of a nomadic, solitary life in a camper van. They live frugally as they travel around the country, or even the world, in their tiny homes.Others go in a different direction, seeking a life which fulfils them and aligns with their values. They may end up in an ‘intentional community’, where both income and property are shared. Some choose to withdraw their children from formal education and instead allow them to follow their own interests, learning what they think they need to, when they need to. Others go even further. They want to run their own country, or micro-nation, so they can live under laws and legislation they believe in. On the Why Factor this week, Shabnam Grewal meets people who reject the society they live in, and choose instead to carve out their own way.Presented and produced by Shabnam GrewalEditor: Richard Knight(Image: Woman looks out the back of her camping van.

There are good reasons for this; climate change is often cited as the big one. But many of us aren’t aware of the huge strides we’ve made over the decades in reducing poverty, improving healthcare and tackling hunger. In fact, according to surveys of people in richer countries at least, the majority of people think the world is getting worse; but why? In this edition of the Why Factor, Sandra Kanthal asks if human nature is wired to fixate on the downsides of life.

In Notes on the State of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson wrote, "Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined and imprisoned.

They carried a new bomb, designed to skip across water avoiding any torpedo nets before hitting the target and sinking into the depths; then exploding.. The bomb was codenamed ‘upkeep’, we know it today as the ‘bouncing bomb’ designed by Barnes Wallis. Those Lancaster's of 617 squadron, commanded 24 year old Guy Gibsonwould become known as the ‘Dam Busters’, the operation was CHASTISE. The mission would be a success, as in two of the targeted dams were hit and breached causing millions of tons of water to surge down into the Ruhr region, flooding mines, destroying factories and homes. The crews that survived the raid would arrive back in Britain as celebrities, swept up in the wartime propaganda; and of course memorialised in books such as Paul Brickhill’s ‘The ‘Dam Busters’, of which the well known 1955 film is based. Joining me to discuss the raid is Victoria Taylor. Victoria is a Post Graduate Researcher at the University of Hull. Her MA thesis is Redressing the Wartime and Postwar Mythologization of Operation CHASTISE in Britain. Recommended books about operation Chastise. Cooper, Alan W. The Men Who Breached the Dams. Pen & Sword Books, 2013. Holland, James. Dam Busters. Random House, 2012. Sweetman, Dr John. The Dambusters Raid(Cassell Military Paperbacks). W&N, 1999. \xa0  | On the 17th September 1944 Gene Metcalfe, of the 82 Airbourne, parachuted in to Holland as part of Operation Market Garden. Approaching the bridge they were to capture Gene is injured in a firefight and left for dead. He would spend the rest of the war as a POW. I talk to Gene about his wartime experiences in the Airbourne, as a POW and what happened once he was liberated. Left for Dead in Nijmegen,\xa0by Marcus Nannini, is the story of Gene's war, it is a fantastic read and well worth picking up a copy.  | One thing I’ve learned from producing these podcasts is the research never ends, it only leads to new avenues of interest branching off from the original topic. And this is the case for Peter Lion. If you recall in episode 33, Peter told us how elements of the US 28nd infantry division, stationed in the Luxembourg town of Wiltz put on a christmas party for the local children, and this included GI Richard Brookins dressing as St Nicholas and arriving by jeep to hand out gifts. In researching that Peter bumped into the story of George Mergenthaler, heir to the Mergenhaler Linotype Company. I’ve been trying to pin down a guest for an ‘extra’ episode for quite a while, so when Peter proposed we discuss his book MERGit I jumped at the chance.\xa0 For Patrons of the podcast I make available parts of the interviews that are off topic or just never made it into the ‘final cut’. I’ve a bit more of Peter and chatting and I’ve decided to release it free to everyone as a big thank you for listening and all the support you’ve all given me. If you want to listen to it you can find it at patreon.com/ww2podcast.  | September 2019 marks the 75th anniversary of Operation Market Garden, the allied attempt to create a sixty mile corridor, and secure a crossing over the Rhine. The plan was to use the newly formed First Allied Airborne Army to seize and hold nine key bridges until relieved by the British Army’s XXX Corp. The Airborne component was known as Market, and the ground attack was Garden. Joining me to talk about the background to airborne operations and Market Garden is Dr William Buckingham. William is the author or Arnhem: The Complete Story of Operation Market Garden 17-25 September 1944. \xa0  | Last year I got an email from Cole Gill, his grandfather had made a number of tape recordings recounting his experiences during the war serving on the Royal Navy ship HMS Exeter, then as a POW at the Fukuoka camp,where he witnessed the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Who wouldn’t be interested in that story?\xa0 Cole sent them over and after listening to them they’ve been languishing in my virtual bottom draw on my computer, awaiting for me to have some inspiration. Well I’ve got them out, dusted them down and what I have for you is the story of Raymond Fitchett. It’s a big thank you to Cole Gill for sharing these recordings.  | In this episode we’re looking at an RAF raid in 1940 against the Dortmund-Ems canal. The canal was a vital trade route with huge amounts of supplies and raw materials passing along it daily. With the fall of France and the build up to Operation Sealion, the invasion of Britain, interrupting the traffic on the canal would aid in upsetting the German timetable. But to undertake the task a level of accuracy was needed from the RAF which was hitherto unheard of… It was very much a proto-dambusters raid. Joining me to discuss the raid is Dr Mark Felton, author of The Bridge Busters. We’ve spoken to Mark before, we looked  Operation Cowboy, where some elements of the Whermacht joined with the Americans to save the world famous Lipizaner horses at the close of WWII. In  episode 49, we discussed British VIP POWs held by the Italians. If you’ve not heard it, dig it out. I think it’s my favorite episode of the WW2 podcast so far. You can also find Mark on YouTube here. | For a long time I’ve been fascinated by movie stars who chose to join the military and saw combat in World War Two. And one star in particular has always interested me, ‘Jimmy Stewart’. \xa0A big star in the 1930’s, in 1940 he would win the Oscar for best man in The Philadelphia Story’ and was nominated for one for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, yet when war came he was insistent on not avoiding it and joined the United States Army Airforce flying combat missions over Europe. Joining me to discuss Jimmy Stewart’s military career is Robert Matzen, author of Mission: Jimmy Stewart and the Fight For Europe. \xa0  | The usual narrative for WWII is that turning points of the war are in 1942 with the battles of Midway, El Alamein and Stalingrad. While these are unquestionably major victories that signalled the ‘end of the beginning’, as Churchill would put it. Friend of the podcast Andrew Nagorski has suggested that actually 1941 was the pivotal year of the war. Andrew contends that the decisions made in 1941, by the major nations, would make an allied victory not just possible but inevitable.\xa0It’s a compelling idea. As we’ve had Andrew on the podcast previously (in episode 18, when discussed Nazi war crimes), I thought it would be good to get him back for a catch up and to outline his thesis laid out in his new book ‘1941: The Year Germany Lost The War’. \xa0  | In the last episode we looked at the American experience of D-Day at Omaha beach, this time it’s the turn of the British and Canadians at Sword, Juno and Gold on the 6th June 1944. In this episode we’re going to concentrate on the British and Canadian landings on D-Day. I’m joined by John Sadler. Now we’ve talked to John before in episode 26, when we looked at Operation Agreement, a combined operations raid in the deserts of North Africa that included \xa0the Long Range Desert Group, the SAS and the Royal Navy. John is also a battlefield guide of the D-Day Beaches and surrounding areas and has a book out called D-Day: The British Landings. | ‘Before the war, Normandy’s Plage d’Or coast was best known for its sleepy villages and holiday destinations. Early in 1944, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel took one look at the gentle, sloping sands and announced ‘They will come here!’ He was referring to Omaha Beach ‒ the primary American D-Day landing site. The beach was subsequently transformed into three miles of lethal, bunker-protected arcs of fire, with chalets converted into concrete strongpoints, fringed by layers of barbed wire and mines. The Germans called it ‘the Devil's Garden’.’ In this episode I’m joined by Robert Kershaw military historian, battlefield guide and author of Fury of Battle: A D-Day landing as it happened.

For the first time polygamy is dissected through a feminist viewpoint, with attention given to the experiences of the women, women who sacrificed everything and suffered long and are never mentioned in museums or landmark tours. Their experiences, along with interviews with experts, sc20140302_130747holars, historians, and those still affected directly by the practice, paint a new portrait of how the west was shaped, by the hard work and toil of these invisible women, hidden away through controversy. Through Hansen’s careful work, we see how the practice of polygamy affected every aspect of the LDS church’s formation and is still a shadow hanging over the church, visible in it’s approach to marriage, the role of women, and the temple ceremonies. Instead of the historical footnote polygamy is often treated as, Hansen shows how this practice, started in secret and a direct cause of Joseph Smith’s death, responsible for driving the saints to Utah, and then outward again to Mexico and Canada, the root of power struggles both in the church and out, the cause of suspicion and eventually violence including the Mountain Meadows Massacre, was an instigator to most of the history of American West. For the first time, The Year of Polygamy shows how the west was settled not only to claim land and mineral rights, but in a very real way to control the bodies and sexuality of women in a way that reverberates today.

In this first episode of the series, the emphasis is on context and place setting, with Sam taking us from the creation of the world to the fall of the Ptolemaic dynasty as we search for the truth behind Alchemy's most elusive and fundamental figure: Hermes Trismegistus. This melting pot of God and Man, Philosophy and Myth serves as our jumping off point as we dive into what may be the deepest rabbit hole yet. We hope you'll enjoy | This week we wrap up our coverage of the Betz Sphere with an examination of the many examinations that have been undertaken of the mysterious object. From the United States Naval to the National Enquirer, the orb has been the subject of scrutiny by a number of organizations. Where did it come from, and why is it here? Is it an alien artifact? A Doomsday Device? A Pokeball? While there are many questions that remain unanswered to this day, there is no doubt this is something more than a simple steel ball. | This week Sam and Jason take a look at one of their weirdest subjects yet! Found unscorched in the remains of a land devouring inferno, the Betz Sphere has fascinated and bewildered skeptics and believers alike since it’s discovery. From autonomous movement which seems to defy the basic laws of physics, to possible attempts at advanced communication, the 8 inch, 22 pound perfectly round stainless steel sphere remains, to this day, an enigma. But what if where everyone is normally looking isn’t the right place to look at all? What other dark secrets may reside in the swamps that produced this haunting orb? We hope you’ll enjoy! | This week we go over the legend of the Wildman of China, or the Yeren, often thought to be a cousin to the North American Sasquatch. We chronicle it's legendary origins, admiring the monolith of Chinese Myth as we pass it by, and explore some of the accounts of it's salacious activities in years gone by, before turning our focus to the modern day. From Communist Party Secretaries to Peasant Cowherds, we tell the stories that have come out of the 20th century that cement the reality of the Wildman in the minds of the people of China. We hope you'll enjoy | This week we highlight a story from the recent release by friend of the show, Linda S. Godfrey. The book is titled 'I Know What I Saw: Modern-Day Encounters with Monsters of New Urban Legend and Ancient Lore' and our subject this week is just one of dozens of excellent stories that are catalogued within it. The Witchy Wolves of the Omer Plain are one part national tragedy, one part spirit guardian, and 100 percent regional folklore at its finest. However, there very well may be more than meets the eye when it comes to these ferocious Spiritual Beings which are said to haunt the graves of fallen warriors. We hope you'll enjoy. | Today we look back, reminiscing as friends and partners, over the first 100 episodes of this ridiculous podcast. We field a few questions, and go on a whole lot of tangents. Thanks for 101 excellent episodes. Here's looking to 101 more. | This week we conclude our two partner on Lunar Conspiracy with some of the most notable theories we've ever covered on the show.

Thank you so much for everyone who has listened!This week we're kicking off our Lunar Tales episodes with a critical, some may say exhaustive, look at the theory that Stanley Kubrick faked the moon landing. We examine the narrative of the faking, and then the revelation, to the world, that Kubrick tried to tell us all but we were too foolish to see. We'll point out waaaaay too many things about the Shining, and give you a walk through of film manipulation techniques, like front screen projection, as we try to explore why anyone would think that the moon landings weren't real to begin with, and then that Kubrick was the one to fake them. We hope you'll enjoy.Please head over to notalonepodcast.com/Moon1 to see the photos referenced in this episode. | This week Jason, for the tenth time, takes command of the show to educate us all about the highly controversial document known as the Piri Reis map. This piece of cartography, which was produced in the 16th century, has been purported to show the coastline of Antartica as it would have appear without its ice cap, millions of years ago. This has lead to a number of speculations, regarding advanced civilizations surviving apocalypse level events and global ice ages, as well as a transmission of knowledge which goes back thousand of years. We hope you'll enjoy as we dive into the mystery that is the Piri Reis map! | This week we dive back into one of Sam's favorite subjects, Jewish mysticism, by way of one of its most fascinating and unique phenomena, The Golem. The clay man, who serves as the supernatural protector of the downtrodden Jews throughout the Diaspora, has long captivated the imagination of the public. We trace it's lineage\xa0through\xa0the Hebrew Bible, to the Talmud, and then examine it under the peculiar light of the dark ages and renaissance practices of Kabbalah.

Dr. Pauli Murray was a pioneering civil rights attorney and a co-founder of the National Organization for Women.

I’m joined by Rich Hatem (https://twitter.com/RichardHatem) , one of the writers behind DC’s Titans (https://www.dcuniverse.com/titans/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=acq_br_titans_dcu_exact&utm_content=dc%20universe_evergreen_cpc&keyword=dc%27s%20titans&gclid=CjwKCAjw_uDsBRAMEiwAaFiHa3wX420J_-1yLY8y0BLuvmGkp6Uhh645qzOwgrG9lplGxe7CMLAs8xoCr0QQAvD_BwE) , to discuss the case and some of the finer aspects of alien abduction experiences.Show Notes | WARNING: THIS EPISODE IS NSFWFor the month of October, we here at the\xa0Our Strange Skies\xa0podcast are paying tribute to\xa0Unsolved Mysteries. This week, I\'m joined by Brian Hastie (https://twitter.com/BrianHastie) of the Double Density Podcast (https://www.doubledensity.net/) and Spencer Wirth-Davis (https://twitter.com/BigCatsBeats) , AKA Big Cats (http://www.bigcatsbeats.com/) of the What If? Podcast (http://whatifpodcast.com/) to reminisce about growing up with Robert Stack in our young lives. We discuss the more memorable cases featured on the show, including the infamous "Boner Episode." Tune in to be terrified by criminals that lack a motive, the chupacabras, and a haunted bunk bed that has haunted viewers for decades. | Every year, a handful of cars take a stroll down a dirt road just off of Clay Point Road in Colchester, Vermont. They’re often lured their by the nostalgia of a former all-girls camp known as Buff Ledge. For 25 years, the camp produced many undefeated swim teams, as well as state and regional champions.\xa0In 1968 the camp earned a reputation as a place where an alien abduction had taken place. It was preserved in the graffiti on camp walls as crude caricatures of UFOs shooting beams of light. Walter N Webb, a UFO investigator, saw the art for himself as a walked among the skeletal remains of the camp in the early 80s.Today, the camp is a “co-op community is for people who want to live in the country ‘but don’t want to be lonely.’” (https://www.colchestersun.com/shores-buff-ledge/) \xa0 The camp, like the memories of an alien abduction decades old, exists in secret, but if you find the right person, they might just talk about the night two young adults were taken on board a UFO on the shores of Lake Champlain.Special thanks to Mark Rodeghier of CUFOS for tracking down a copy of Walter Webb’s book.

Varginha sits in the same state that saw the Villas Boas incident occur, Minas Gerais. Varginha is one of the major producers of coffee in Brazil, and exports its products all over the world.In 1996, a story would coagulate and form into a narrative involving a crashed UFO, alien bodies, a government cover-up, and the death of a Brazilian military official. The red eyes of the alien being, and the three bony protrusions atop its head, have come to represent one of the strangest incidents in Brazilian ufology.Join us as we try to unpack just what happened on the streets of Varginha.Show notes (https://www.ourstrangeskies.com/08-brazils-roswell) | Every so often I\'m asked to recommend books to those who would like to explore the UFO topic. Here is a bonus episode devoted to book recommendations. Prepare to get book wrecked!List of Books (https://www.ourstrangeskies.com/bookwrecked) | Toward the tail end of the flap in Colares, Brazilian ufology would undergo a transformation into something supremely darker. Reports of Brazilian residents would continue to come in during the flap, which lasted into 1978. Dr. Carvalho would treat over 35 patients during the year long flap, and would have a few sightings of her own. Operação Prato team members would have sightings of their own, ruling out the possibility of mass hysteria.Just what happened in the small town of Colares in 1977 and 78? Join us for the final part of our series on the Colares flap, and try to unravel the mystery of just what happened.Show Notes (https://www.ourstrangeskies.com/07-harm-from-above-part-2) | In the December 1967 issue of Flying Saucer Review, there appeared an article written by Jerome Clark titled “Why UFOs Are Hostile.” In it, he presents a few cases and a load of speculation as to why UFOs are hostile. One of the stories presented is that of James Flynn, a Florida resident who had been sleeping in a swamp when he was awoken by his dogs barking. He witnessed a craft, and claimed that it rendered him unconscious for 24 hours.The article is largely supported by heavy speculation, and had little to actually back it. By and large, in the United States, UFOs were relatively tame. They seemed more curious than harmful. Thomas Mantell’s death couldn’t be exclusively proven to have been at the hands of a UFO, and the disappearance of Felix Moncla was mysterious, but still remained unknown.In Brazil, however, they started to earn the reputation of a country that suffered from its UFO sightings. In the late 70s, a flap of UFO activity occurred that resulted in serious injury, and even the deaths of Brazilian residents around the city of Colares in northern Brazil.Show Notes (https://www.ourstrangeskies.com/06-harm-from-above-part-1) | The 1950s saw the rise of the contactees, a group of ordinary people that had been chosen by aliens from Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn to deliver a message to the citizens of earth: save the planet from atomic fallout. The message was always the same, and their cultures were strikingly similar.\xa0In 1957, a UFO event would change all that. In October, a young Brazilian farmer was forced on board a UFO, stripped of his clothes, mated with an alien woman, and had blood taken from his chin, before being taken on a tour of the craft and deposited back on earth.\xa0The events of the Antônio Villas Boas abduction occurred four years before what many believe to be the first abduction case, Betty and Barney Hill. But in many ways the Antônio Villas Boas story sets itself apart from the rest as the analog abduction, an event devoid of high strangeness in many ways.Special thanks to Fabi for providing research assistance, and Ryan Sprague (https://twitter.com/SomewhereSkies) , for offering his vocal talents. Check out his amazing podcast, Somewhere in the Skies (https://www.somewhereintheskies.com/) wherever you find your podcasts!Show Notes (https://www.ourstrangeskies.com/05-the-analog-abduction) | There are certain areas across the United States that seem to draw UFOs. Catalina Island, off the coast of Southern California, is a place where you can see UFOs coming in and out of the water, and where, in 2014 it was rumored that one Google Earth image showed an underwater alien base under the water. Well, that claim turned out to be bunk, but the area is still known as UFO hot spot.On September 20th, 2011 Chuck Zukowski introduced the world to a new theory called the 37th Degree Theory. Chuck noted how a number of UFO sightings and cattle mutilations were concentrated all along the 37th parallel. There are other infamous hot spots around the United States, such as the Pine Bush area of upstate New York, the American Southwest, and Pacific Northwest to name a few.One ordinary town has seen a fair share of UFO sightings since 1975. North Bergen, a town of 60,000 residents, can be found just across the Hudson river, opposite Manhattan. On January 12, 1975, a dramatic landing took place in North Hudson Park, across from the famed Stonehenge apartment complex. From West 89th Street in Manhattan, this building can been seen. Today, it’s towering edifice serves as a monument to a strange incident involving a UFO and a group of short beings that took an interest in the soil.Show notes (https://www.ourstrangeskies.com/04-the-stonehenge-incidents) | Brazil always seemed to be a step ahead of all other countries when it came to UFO sightings. While the U.S. was seeing objects in the sky, Brazilians were encountering humanoids of various types. Within a matter of years, the country garnered a reputation for having some of the most violent UFO encounters on record. This story, though, is a bit different. The UFO miracle sits in stark contrast to most of Brazil\'s UFO encounters. This is the story of a girl who was healed by those that do not dwell here.This episode is dedicated to the memories of Barb Kristoffersen and Patrick Whitney.Show Notes (https://www.ourstrangeskies.com/new-page-2)', 'chan_desc': 'Our Strange Skies is a biweekly podcast that delves into the stories of ordinary people encountering the "unidentified" in our backyard and beyond.

Philippa, who is a featured scholar in The Last Czars, shares her experience being interviewed, her impression of the show after seeing it, and her work to correct historical errors that viewers identified after release. Dr. Philippa Hetherington is a Lecturer in Modern Eurasian History at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College London. Her research focuses on the legal history of imperial Russia and the early Soviet Union in global and transnational context. You can follow Philippa on twitter at @philippahether. Dr. Jonathan Waterlow is the author of It’s Only a Joke Comrade! Humor, Trust and Everyday Life Under Stalin, and cohost of the Voices in the Dark podcast. He received his Doctorate in History from the University of Oxford and was a Postdoctoral Fellow at St. Anthony’s College (Oxford) and the University of Toronto.

This episode of RTN Theology explores the power of conversation, creativity, and working in generative ways across difference and division. Chris has a conversation about conversation with C. Christopher Smith, author of How the Body of Christ Talks. Bob and Chris also got the chance to talk with Will Acuff of Corner to Corner in Nashville, TN about the amazing community organizing and empowerment work he, his wife Tiffany, and their team are doing with the youth in their community. Throughout the episode you’ll hear music from Russ Mohr, from his recent collaborative project, The Kingdom Sessions. Christopher Smith (Indianapolis, IN) is a long-time member of the Englewood Christian Church community on the urban Near Eastside of Indianapolis, founding editor of The Englewood Review of Books, and acclaimed author.

The answer, says Ohio State historian Bartow Elmore, has everything to do with its business structure. In this episode, Bart offers his take on how Coke went from Atlanta soda parlors in the late 19th century to markets across the globe in less than a century, all along reaping tremendous benefits from public infrastructure while passing the bulk of its environmental costs on to others. \xa0Bart also talks about the difficulties of doing research on powerful corporations, why he thinks we should care about environmental history, and the meaning of what he calls “Coca-Cola Capitalism.” Dr. Bartow Elmore is Associate Professor of History at The Ohio State University. His book, Citizen Coke: The Making of Coca-Cola Capitalism (W.W. Norton, 2015) won the Axiom Business Book Award for best business commentary in 2015 and the Council of Graduate Schools 2016 Gustave O. Arlt Award in the Humanities.

Yet, in deciding the meaning of the Revolution, the evolving popular memory of its meaning counts as well. Founders like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams frequently told younger Americans not to revere the Revolution and its leaders as demigods, insisting that future generations were just as capable, if not more so, of continuing and improving America\'s experiment in government. Professor Freeman concludes the lecture by suggesting that the ultimate lesson of the American Revolution is that America\'s experiment in government was supposed to be an ongoing process; that the Revolution taught Americans that their political opinions and actions mattered a great deal - and that they still do. | Professor Freeman discusses the national debate over the proposed Constitution, arguing that in many ways, when Americans debated its ratification, they were debating the consequences and meaning of the Revolution. Some feared that a stronger, more centralized government would trample on the rights and liberties that had been won through warfare, pushing the new nation back into tyranny, monarchy, or aristocracy. The Federalist essays represented one particularly ambitious attempt to quash Anti-Federalist criticism of the Constitution. In the end, the Anti-Federalists did have one significant victory, securing a Bill of Rights to be added after the new Constitution had been ratified by the states. | Professor Freeman discusses the debate over the Constitution at the Federal Convention of 1787 - a convention that by no means had an inevitable outcome. Indeed, even attending the Convention at all was a subject of debate in the individual states; many people feared that the Convention would produce a pseudo-monarchical form of government that would abandon the true significance of the Revolution. Ostensibly called to revise the Articles of Confederation, the meeting ultimately produced an entirely new form of government, in part, thanks to the influence of James Madison\'s "Virginia Plan" of government. Professor Freeman focuses on three subjects of debate among the many that occupied the Convention: the debates over representation, slavery, and the nature of the executive branch. | In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses how the new nation moved towards creating a stronger, more centralized national government than the Articles of Confederation. Complications of commerce between individual states - a factor that wasn\'t regulated by the Articles - led to a series of interstate gatherings, like the Mount Vernon Conference of March 1785. Some strong nationalists saw these meetings as an ideal opportunity to push towards revising the Articles of Confederation. Professor Freeman ends with a discussion of James Madison\'s preparations for the Federal Convention, and the importance of his notes in understanding the process by which delegates drafted a new Constitution. | In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the Articles of Confederation. Although they seem hopelessly weak in the long view of history, the Articles made perfect sense as a first stab at a national government by a people who deeply distrusted centralized power - a direct product of their recent experience of the British monarchy. Among the many issues that complicated the drafting of the Articles, three central issues included: how war debts to European nations would be divided among the states; whether western territories should be sold by the national government to pay for those debts; and how large and small states would compromise on representation. When a series of events - like Shays\' Rebellion - highlighted the weaknesses of the Articles, some Americans felt ready to consider a stronger national government. | This lecture discusses the ongoing political experimentation involved in creating new constitutions for the new American states. Having declared independence from Great Britain, Americans had to determine what kind of government best suited their individual states as well as the nation at large; to many, this was the "whole object" of their revolutionary turmoil. Different people had different ideas about what kind of republican government would work best for their state. Should there be a unicameral or a bicameral legislature? How should political representation be organized and effected? How far should the principle of popular sovereignty be taken? | In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the experiences of African Americans, women, and Native Americans during the Revolution, framing her discussion within a larger historical debate over whether or not the Revolution was "radical." Freeman ultimately concludes that while white American males improved their position in society as a result of the Revolution, women, African Americans, and Native Americans did not benefit in the same ways. | Today\'s lecture concludes Professor Freeman\'s discussion of the four phases of the Revolutionary War. America\'s victory at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 marked the end of the third phase of the war, and led to a turning point in the conflict: France\'s decision to recognize American independence and enter into an alliance with the fledging nation. Although the British made one final attempt at reconciliation in 1778 with the Conciliatory Propositions, they were rejected by the Continental Congress. The fourth and final phase of the war lasted from 1779 to 1781, as the British Army focused its attention on the American South. The British seized Charleston and South Carolina, and defeated the Continental Army in a series of battles. But with the help of the French fleet, Washington was able to defeat Cornwallis\'s army at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. Peace negotiations to end the Revolutionary War began in Paris in June of 1782. | In this lecture, Professor Freeman explains the logic behind American and British military strategy during the early phases of the Revolution. First, she discusses the logistic disadvantages of the British during the war: the difficulties shipping men and supplies from more than three thousand miles away; the vast expanse of countryside with no one central target to attack; difficulties in recruiting British soldiers to fight in America; and the fact that the British faced a citizen army comprised of highly motivated soldiers who didn\'t act in predictable ways. In addition, the British consistently underestimated the revolutionaries in America, and overestimated Loyalist support. Professor Freeman also discusses the four main phases of the Revolutionary War, differentiated by shifts in British strategy. During the earliest phase of the war, the British thought that a show of military force would quickly lead to reconciliation with the colonists. During the second phase, the British resolved to seize a major city - New York - in the hope that isolating New England from the rest of the colonies would end hostilities. By 1777, the war had entered its third phase, and the British set their sights on seizing Philadelphia and defeating George Washington. This phase ended with the Battle of Saratoga in late 1777. | This lecture focuses on George Washington and the combined qualities that made him a key figure in Revolutionary America, arguing that the most crucial reason for his success as a national leader was that he proved repeatedly that he could be trusted with power - a vital quality in a nation fearful of the collapse of republican governance at the hands of a tyrant.', 'chan_desc': 'The American Revolution entailed some remarkable transformations--converting British colonists into American revolutionaries, and a cluster of colonies into a confederation of states with a common cause -- but it was far more complex and enduring than the fighting of a war. As John Adams put it, "The Revolution was in the Minds of the people... before a drop of blood was drawn at Lexington"--and it continued long past America\'s victory at Yorktown. This course will examine the Revolution from this broad perspective, tracing the participants\' shifting sense of themselves as British subjects, colonial settlers, revolutionaries, and Americans.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts/1a/fb/df/tns.zyuliyvd.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2011-03-29'}}

According to Professor Kagan, through these actions, Philip was able to make inroads into the Greek world. What made these inroads more effective was Philip's uncanny talent for diplomacy and the fighting between the various poleis. Eventually, the Greeks under the efforts of Athens and Demosthenes decided to face Philip in the battle of Chaeronea. The battle, though close, was won by Philip and his Macedonian forces. Finally, Professor Kagan evaluates the actions of Demosthenes and concludes that his actions should be judged as a noble endeavor of one who loved freedom. | In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the growth of a new power: Thebes. Under the leadership of Epaminondas and Pelopidas, Thebes grows into a major power among the Greek cities. In fact, the Thebans even rout the Spartans in a standard hoplite battle in the battle of Leuctra. Finally, Professor Kagan points out that by the time of Theban hegemony, the Greek world had experienced so many wars and conflicts that it opened the door to a powerful leader: Philip of Macedon. | In this lecture, Professor Kagan examines the continuation of Spartan tyranny over the Greek poleis and the response of the Greek world. According to Professor Kagan, it became clear that the Greek poleis needed to do something to check the power of Sparta. So, Thebes, Argos, Corinth, and Athens along with some of the smaller poleis joined together to fight Sparta in the Corinthian War. The war ended in a stalemate, but now the Persians were afraid of the growth of Athenian naval power. So, the king made an alliance with Sparta to bring about the King's Peace, which emphasized Greek autonomy and which had the effect of breaking up all alliances, except the Peloponnesian League. After this fact, Sparta continued in its tyrannical behavior. | In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War and how the Spartans began to dominate other Greek poleis, instead of liberating them. The Spartan general Lysander at this point not only grows in influence and power, but also follows an aggressive plan to establish pro-Spartan, oligarchical governments. However, according to Professor Kagan, this fact angered many cities. Therefore, Thrasybulus, along with the help of other poleis, resisted Spartan rule. Eventually he opposed Sparta at Phyle and in time reestablished the democracy of Athens. | In this lecture, Professor Kagan examines Pericles as a general. First, he describes Pericles' strategy of war and then he evaluates this strategy. According to Professor Kagan, Pericles' strategy was characterized by being both defensive and rational. It was defensive, because the Athenians did not engage the Spartans in a traditional hoplite battle, and it was rational, because Pericles assumed that the Spartans would cease fighting when they realized that the Athenians did not have to fight a land battle, since they had a walled city and a navy. On its surface, this strategy seems reasonable, but Professor Kagan points out that there were two flaws. First, the Athenians did not have an offensive plan: that is, a plan to deter the Spartans from quitting the war. Second, Pericles failed to realize that war is not always rational. | In this lecture, Professor Kagan focuses on the causes of the Peloponnesian War and the possible motivations for Thucydides' book, The History of the Peloponnesian War. Concerning the first point, Professor Kagan parts ways with Thucydides and argues that the war was not inevitable and that the Athenians under Pericles followed a policy of deterrence, which was aimed at peace. Similarly, he points out that there were a number of Spartans who did not want war as well. Therefore, according to this line of reasoning, war broke out due to a number of factors that were avoidable. Concerning the second point, Professor Kagan argues that Thucydides was a revisionist historian. In other words, Thucydides was writing not as a disinterested historian, but as a historian with a point to make, namely, that the war was inevitable and that Athens was only a democracy in name under Pericles. Finally, Professor Kagan acknowledges that his two points are debatable. | In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the aftermath of the Thirty Years Peace. He argues that the Peace had the potential to keep peace between Athens and Sparta due to the arbitration clause. In addition, he argues that during this time, Athens sends various diplomatic messages to the wider Greek world stating their intentions for peace, such as the Panhellenic venture to establish Thurii. However, this peace is seriously challenged when Corinth and Corcyra come into conflict over Epidamnus. At this point, Athens could make an alliance with Corcyra and run the risk of angering Sparta or allow Corinth to potentially take over Corcyra's navy and change the naval balance of power. Athens decides on a defensive alliance. | In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the events that lead up the Peloponnesian War. He argues that the rise of Athenian power and the concomitant challenge to Spartan dominance pointed to potential conflict. However, Professor Kagan also points out that there were many people who did not want war and that therefore war was not inevitable. The Thirty Years Peace was negotiated, and Professor Kagan finally argues that its clause for arbitration was the key clause that could have prevented war. | In this lecture, Professor Kagan continues to discuss the constitution of Athens. In particular, he explores the judicial workings of Athens. He describes in detail the effort of the Athenians to create a system of justice that would not only minimize tampering, in order to insure justice, but also maximize citizen participation. After this discussion, Professor Kagan comments on the role of women in Athens by looking at two types of sources. The picture that emerges is considerably complex and left without resolution. Finally, he comments on the role of slaves. In each of these discussions, he draws illuminating analogies to our modern society. | In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the mechanics of the Delian League and its transformation into the Athenian empire. This transformation caused Athens to rival Sparta as an equal in power and prestige. He also argues that this process took place rather smoothly due to the good relations between Sparta and Athens. Professor Kagan argues that Cimon the Athenian generally played an important part in this development. Finally, Professor Kagan begins to describe the workings of Athenian democracy by comparing it with modern American democracy.", 'chan_desc': '(CLCV 205) This is an introductory course in Greek history tracing the development of Greek civilization as manifested in political, intellectual, and creative achievements from the Bronze Age to the end of the classical period.

The ways that the United States has overcome the legacy of its colonial past with Great Britain is, in many ways, unique, especially by comparison to the former Spanish Americas. Today\'s guest, Lina del Castillo, recently published a book titled Crafting Republic for the World: Scientific, Geographic, and Historiographic Inventions of Colombia, which offers a new understanding of how Gran Colombia--which split from Spain at the beginning of the 19th century, and then further subdivided into Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador--came to deal with its own past, and the role that science, geography, and history came to play alongside politics as the former colonies grew into nationhood. | Sexual orientation conversion therapy, the attempt to change one\'s sexual orientation through psychological or therapeutic practice, has now been banned in 17 American states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, three Canadian provinces, one state in Australia and several nations in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Beyond the merits of sexual orientation conversion therapy as a medical practice, however, lies a social importance of what the practice represents for a segment of American society.Today\'s guest, Chris Babits, is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, where he researches the history of the practice and why so many people still support it, even in the face of opposition from medical and psychological professionals. | In the spring of 2019, a widely circulated column assailed the field of history for being too "esoteric," in particular calling out subfields like women\'s and gender studies. The executive director of the American Historical Association, Jim Grossman, wrote a response suggesting that the critic should have talked to actual historians about why fields that may seem esoteric are actually very valuable. Today\'s guests are the editors of the Oxford Handbook of American Women\'s and Gender History. Ellen Hartigan O\'Connor and Lisa Matterson, both professors of history at the University of California, Davis, join us to discuss the field of women\'s studies, which as they\'ve argued in the introduction to the book, is not an esoteric topic at all, but actually quite critical to our understanding of American history. | Historians have long assumed that white women in the U.S. south benefited only indirectly from the ownership of enslaved people. Historians have neglected these women because their behavior didn’t conform to the picture we have of the patriarchal culture of the 18-19 century marriage. In an extraordinary new book, Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers shows that “slave owning women not only witnessed the most brutal features of slavery, they took part in them, they profited from them, and they defended them.” Prof. Jones-Rogers joins us today to talk about the narratives of formerly enslaved people, whose testimony changes the way we view those white women and the lives of the enslaved in the U.S. | The Beatles arrived for their first concert in the United States on February 11, 1964 to rabid fanfare. Legions of screaming women greeted John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr on every stop of the U.S. tour, leading to observers dubbing the period as “Beatlemania.” As one of the most commercially successful and influential musicians of all time, almost every pop music artist cites their influence over their music. Yet who were the Beatles? What was their music like? And why were they so popular? Ph.D. student in history Eddie Watson takes us deep into the history of the Beatles first tour in the United States, and reveals why we should understand these popular cultural movements. But perhaps most importantly, Eddie tells us who is the best Beatle, reveals their greatest hits, and regales us of his own attempt at the Beatle bowl cut. | Biodiversity has been a key concept in international conservation since the 1980s, yet historians have paid little attention to its origins. Uncovering its roots in tropical fieldwork and the southward expansion of U.S. empire at the turn of the twentieth century, ecologists took advantage of growing U.S. landholdings in the circum-Caribbean by establishing permanent field stations for long-term, basic tropical research.Megan Raby describes how, from these outposts of U.S. science, a growing community of American "tropical biologists" developed both the key scientific concepts and the values embedded in the modern discourse of biodiversity. | The subject of endless speculation, fascination, and laudatory writings, German physicist Albert Einstein captured the imaginations of millions after his discoveries transformed the field of physics. Hailed as a god, saint, a miracle, and even a canonized angel by his biographers and contemporaries alike, Einstein seems a figure worthy of his larger than life status. Not so fast says today\'s guest, Dr. Alberto Martínez. We go deep into the personal life of Einstein, discussing his damaged relationships, intellectually incoherent views on pacifism and religion, and his own eccentric worldview. Guest Dr. Martínez of the University of Texas at Austin joins us today to discuss who Einstein really was, and how science really is done - reminding us that Einstein was not Jesus Christ, not Harry Potter, but just a normal man. | Iran is home to the largest Jewish population in the Middle East outside of Israel. At its peak in the 20th century, the population of Jews was over 100,000; today about 25,000 Jews still live in Iran. Iranian Jews rejected the siren call of the Zionist movement to instead participate in the Iranian nationbuilding process, welcoming European refugees during World War II, and participating in international exchanges between Iran and Israel.Guest Lior Sternfeld from Penn State discusses the rich history of Iran\'s Jewish community in the 20th century, and discusses the unique place of the community in Iran under the Shah, and how Jews even contributed to the 1979 revolution. | Between 1910 and 1920, an era of state-sanctioned racial violence descended upon the U.S.-Mexico border. Texas Rangers, local ranchers, and U.S. soldiers terrorized ethnic Mexican communities, under the guise of community policing. They enjoyed a culture of impunity, in which, despite state investigations, no one was ever prosecuted. This period left generations of Texans with a deep sense of injustice, and representations of this period in popular culture still celebrate police violence against ethnic Mexicans. Yet families fought back, demanding justice for atrocities against Mexican-American communities. Guest Monica Martínez of Brown University joins us today to discuss what happened on the Texas border a hundred years ago. She also reveals the striking similarities of the period to the Trump administration\'s November 2018 decision to send military troops to the border. | Many American Indian cultures, like the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, practiced a form of non-hereditary slavery for centuries before contact with Europeans. But after Europeans arrived on Native shores, and they forcibly brought African people into labor in the beginning of the 17th century, the dynamics of native slavery practices changed. Supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War, how did traditional native slavery transform in the Indian Territory throughout the 18th and 19th centuries into something resembling the unchangeable enslavement system of the American South?Guest Nakia Parker joins us to discuss the African American slave-holding practices of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians during the 19th century, tells us how this system evolved, and reveals the claims to tribal citizenship from this enslavement persisting to the present day.', 'chan_desc': '15 Minute History is a history podcast designed for historians, enthusiasts, and newbies alike.

We begin by considering a prophecy which illustrates the plight that Greece found herself in as the Persian army and navy entered Europe. We discuss the state of preparation in each relative camp as they made their respective preparations for the battle to come. We then discuss the regions in and around Artemisium and the island of Euboea, where the first naval battle of the war would take place. We consider the strategic advantages inherent in certain sites in the region, the theories about how large each navy would have been at this stage in history, and then we get into the opening moves of the chess game that would set up the conflict at Artemisium. A \'Hellesponter\' makes an dramatic appearance, and we witness some mishaps at sea in Part One of our look at the naval Battle of Artemisium. Show Notes - http://maritimehistorypodcast.com/ep-036-the-naval-battle-of-artemisium-part-i  | In today\'s episode we take a look at the final moves that both Greece and Persia made on the eve of their war. Themistocles and Aristides take center stage as they maneuver through the political scene of Athens, but with the success of the Themistoclean naval policy, we discuss how the Greeks may have rapidly built up their navy. We consider the Greek congress of city-states, their relative lack of support, and the final measures they took to try and recruit allies. We also consider a canal project and pontoon bridges that Xerxes had built to aid his army and navy as they both marched and sailed west to Greece. We conclude with a rather bizarre scene where the Persians try to beat the Hellespont into subjection and, ultimately, they all make it over into Europe. The stage is set for the final Greco-Persian War. Show Notes - http://maritimehistorypodcast.com/ep-035-the-eve-of-war | A substantial portion of the Persian fleet was wrecked in a storm in 492 BCE, but after Darius ordered it to be rebuilt, they set sail for Greece in the summer of 490. Today\'s episode examines the state of the Persian navy at this point, after which we discuss the fleet\'s route to Eritrea and Marathon, the site of one of Greece\'s most famous military victories. It was a land battle though, so after a brief look at some naval elements connected to it, we paint a picture of Athens after Marathon, where political leaders like Themistocles had to fear the newly popular use of ostracism. We conclude by setting the stage for the third and final Persian invasion of Greece. | In today\'s episode the curtain rises on a young man named Themistocles. He\'s always recognized for the role that he played at Salamis and in the Greek navy\'s stand against Persia, but today we go back to the earliest we know about his life. We ended last episode in 493 BCE when the Ionian Revolt was effectively ended at Lade, but in that same year Themistocles was made eponymous archon of Athens. Today we look at the early stages of the naval reforms he tried to institute in Athens, with a particular focus on the Athenian port of Phaleron. It was a weak port despite being the only port Athens had used in her history, so after looking at why it was weak, we then look at the location Themistocles proposed as an alternative, the Piraeus. A story that runs through the episode and probably shaped the views of a young Themistocles is one that involves an island rival of Athens, the mercantile power of Aegina. She\'d become a naval power before Athens had, so today we look at an undeclared war that simmered between them, the naval focus of their conflicts, and why Aegina actually played an interesting role in the shaping up of the greater conflict with Persia. There\'s also a bit in there somewhere about Persia\'s first attempt to invade Greece and the storm that caused one of the biggest naval disasters to that point in ancient history. A meandering but interesting episode, I hope. | Welcome to our third annual Halloween special here at the Maritime History Podcast. Rather than choose a grim, frightening, or eery tale, this year I felt that a more lighthearted fare was in order. This story was written by an Englishman named Richard Middleton. It tells of a quiet countryside village named Fairfield where the townsfolk are as comfortable with the ghosts that populate the village as they are with their neighbors. After a storm one night, a villager finds a ghostly ship at anchor in his turnip garden, and the story continues to elaborate the rather humorous consequences of having a ghost ship in temporary residence in "the ghostliest place in all England." Backing music for this story comes courtesy of Danish pianist\xa0Peter Bille Larsen. This specific song is Piano Nocturne No. 2 (A Loving Venus Brought You Stars). | If Episode 031 covered the heady, opening stages of the Ionian Revolt, then today\'s episode covers the\xa0denouement and rather anticlimactic conclusion of the revolt. At the start of the episode we follow Aristagoras as he goes on a recruiting trip to Sparta and Athens, using a world map to try and sway the Spartan king into joining the revolt. Athenian ships join the revolt, but after some early success in Ionia, Athens quickly withdraws. She has gained the attention of the Persian king by briefly aiding Ionia, but before Darius repays Athenian meddling he resubjugates Ionia and the surrounding regions. The end of the Ionian Revolt and Darius\' campaign to retake Ionia centers on Miletus, naturally. The conclusion of our episode focuses on the naval battle that brought an end to the revolt, a letdown of a naval encounter off the island of Lade. Herodotus gives us some great detail about the training of the Ionian navy and the events of the battle itself, so today\'s episode takes us all over the ancient Greek world. Show Notes - http://maritimehistorypodcast.com/ep-032-letdown-lade | In today\'s episode we begin our look at the events that directly contributed to the beginnings of the Greco-Persian War. After a brief summation of the events that brought the early Persian Empire into contact with the Ionian Greeks, we take a look at the evidence and theories about what the naval situation was like in the Aegean during the late 6th century BCE. We then consider how and why Persia went about building up its navy, including how Ionian Greek cities fit into the Persian system once they were subjugated. We then meet a tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, who\'s ambition and cunning spurred an Ionian/Persian invasion of Naxos, where a fleet of 200 ships besieged the island. Following this attempted invasion, we conclude by seeing how Miletus and an Ionian confederation decided to instead seize part of the Persian navy and start revolt against the empire from the east. Somewhere in there we also consider a unique form of punishment aboard a trireme. \xa0 Show Notes - http://maritimehistorypodcast.com/ep-031-a-persian-navy-an-ionian-revolt | Today we have a lengthy primer focused only on the\xa0trireme. After a jaunt through some of the evidence related to when the trireme first came into use on the seas of ancient Greece and the Near East we then take a deep dive into the numerous aspects of the ship itself. We discuss the materials used by ancient shipwrights, the process of building and outfitting a trireme, and the design of this ship that set it apart from the oared galleys of archaic Greece. The trireme was essentially an oar-powered maritime missile, so we then outline the various sailors who made up the typical 200-man contingent of each trireme. The\xa0trierarch\xa0functioned as a ship captain, and from there we meet the other 199 men, 170 of whom were oarsmen. Much of what we know about the trireme has been confirmed via the reconstruction of\xa0Olympias\xa0and the ensuing sea trials that she underwent. After a bit about\xa0Olympias, we conclude with a look at the naval tactics that developed in the wake of the trireme taking over the naval scene in ancient Greece. All in all, what we\'ve got is a 105-minute ode to the most important ship of the ancient world: the trireme.

Some believers would look for signs that civilization was declining, such as wars and natural disasters, or for new Roman Empires that would harbour the Antichrist, and from these predict the time of the Rapture.  Darby helped establish the Plymouth Brethren, and later his ideas were picked up in the Scofield Reference Bible (1909) and soon became influential, particularly in the USA.  With Elizabeth PhillipsResearch Fellow at the Margaret Beaufort Institute at the University of Cambridge and Honorary Fellow in the Department of Theology and Religion at Durham UniversityCrawford GribbenProfessor of Early Modern British History at Queen’s University Belfastand Nicholas GuyattReader in North American History at the University of CambridgeProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the range, depth and style of Browne (1605-82) , a medical doctor whose curious mind drew him to explore and confess his own religious views, challenge myths and errors in science and consider how humans respond to the transience of life.  His Religio Medici became famous throughout Europe and his openness about his religion, in that work, was noted as rare when others either kept quiet or professed orthodox views. His Pseudodoxia Epidemica challenged popular ideas, whether about the existence of mermaids or if Adam had a navel, and his Hydriotaphia or Urn Burial was a meditation on what matters to humans when handling the dead. In 1923, Virginia Woolf wrote, "Few people love the writings of Sir Thomas Browne, but those that do are the salt of the earth."  He also contributed more words to the English language than almost anyone, such as electricity, indigenous, medical, ferocious, carnivorous ambidextrous and migrant.With Claire PrestonProfessor of Renaissance Literature at Queen Mary University of LondonJessica WolfeProfessor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of North Carolina at Chapel HillAndKevin KilleenProfessor of English at the University of YorkProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss how artists from the Middle Ages onwards have been inspired by the Bible story of the widow who killed an Assyrian general who was besieging her village, and so saved her people from his army and from his master Nebuchadnezzar.  A symbol of a woman\'s power and the defiance of political tyranny, the image of Judith has been sculpted by Donatello, painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and, in the case of Caravaggio, Liss and Artemisia Gentileschi, been shown with vivid, disturbing detail.  What do these interpretations reveal of the attitudes to power and women in their time, and of the artists\' own experiences? The image of Judith, above is from a tapestry in the Duomo, Milan, by Giovanni or Nicola Carcher, 1555With Susan FoisterCurator of Early Netherlandish, German and British Painting at the National GalleryJohn GashSenior Lecturer in History of Art at the University of AberdeenAnd Ela Nutu HallResearch Associate at the Sheffield Institute for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies, at the University of SheffieldProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss why, in 1870, the Vatican Council issued the decree ‘pastor aeternus’ which, among other areas, affirmed papal infallibility.  It meant effectively that the Pope could not err in his teachings, an assertion with its roots in the early Church when the bishop of Rome advanced to being the first among equals, then overall head of the Christian Church in the West.  The idea that the Pope could not err had been a double-edged sword from the Middle Ages, though; while it apparently conveyed great power, it also meant a Pope was constrained by whatever a predecessor had said.  If a later Pope were to contradict an earlier Pope, then one of them must be wrong, and how could that be…if both were infallible?WithTom O’LoughlinProfessor of Historical Theology at the University of NottinghamRebecca RistProfessor in Medieval History at the University of ReadingAnd Miles PattendenDepartmental Lecturer in Early Modern History at the University of OxfordProducer: Simon Tillotson and Julia Johnson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the war in Europe which begain in 1618 and continued on such a scale and with such devastation that its like was not seen for another three hundred years. It pitched Catholics against Protestants, Lutherans against Calvinists and Catholics against Catholics across the Holy Roman Empire, drawing in their neighbours and it lasted for thirty gruelling years, from the Defenestration of Prague to the Peace of Westphalia of 1648.  Many more civilians died than soldiers, and famine was so great that even cannibalism was excused. This topic was chosen from several hundred suggested by listeners this autumn.The image above is a detail from a painting of The Battle of White Mountain on 7-8 November 1620, by Pieter Snayers (1592-1667)WithPeter WilsonChichele Professor of the History of War at the University of OxfordUlinka RublackProfessor of Early Modern European History at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of St John’s CollegeAndToby OsborneAssociate Professor in History at Durham UniversityProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the philosophy of hope. To the ancient Greeks, hope was closer to self-deception, one of the evils left in Pandora\'s box or jar, in Hesiod\'s story.  In Christian tradition, hope became one of the theological virtues, the desire for divine union and the expectation of receiving it, an action of the will rather than the intellect.  To Kant, \'what may I hope\' was one of the three basic questions which human reason asks, while Nietzsche echoed Hesiod, arguing that leaving hope in the box was a deception by the gods, reflecting human inability to face the demands of existence. Yet even those critical of hope, like Camus, conceded that life was nearly impossible without it.WithBeatrice Han-PileProfessor of Philosophy at the University of EssexRobert SternProfessor of Philosophy at the University of SheffieldAndJudith WolfeProfessor of Philosophical Theology at the University of St AndrewsProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas and life of the German theologian, born in Breslau/Wroclaw in 1906 and killed in the Flossenbürg concentration camp on 9th April 1945. Bonhoeffer developed ideas about the role of the Church in the secular world, in particular Germany after the Nazis took power in 1933 and demanded the Churches\' support. He strongly opposed anti-Semitism and, with a role in the Military Intelligence Department, took part in the resistance, plotting to kill Hitler and meeting with contacts in the Allies. Bonhoeffer\'s ideas on Christian ethics and the relationship between Christianity and humanism spread more widely from the 1960s with the discovery of unpublished works, including those written in prison as he awaited execution.With Stephen PlantDean and Runcie Fellow at Trinity Hall at the University of CambridgeEleanor McLaughlinLecturer in Theology and Ethics at the University of Winchester and Lecturer in Ethics at Regent’s Park College at the University of OxfordAnd Tom GreggsMarischal Chair of Divinity at the University of AberdeenProducer: Simon Tillotson | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss St Augustine of Hippo\'s account of his conversion to Christianity and his life up to that point. Written c397AD, it has many elements of autobiography with his scrutiny of his earlier life, his long relationship with a concubine, his theft of pears as a child, his work as an orator and his embrace of other philosophies and Manichaeism. Significantly for the development of Christianity, he explores the idea of original sin in the context of his own experience. The work is often seen as an argument for his Roman Catholicism, a less powerful force where he was living in North Africa where another form of Christianity was dominant, Donatism. While Augustine retells many episodes from his own life, the greater strength of his Confessions has come to be seen as his examination of his own emotional development, and the growth of his soul.WithKate CooperProfessor of History at the University of London and Head of History at Royal HollowayMorwenna LudlowProfessor of Christian History and Theology at the University of Exeterand Martin PalmerVisiting Professor in Religion, History and Nature at the University of WinchesterProducer: Simon Tillotson. | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the event of which Voltaire, two hundred years later, said \'nothing was more well known\'. In 1565, Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman leader, sent a great fleet west to lay siege to Malta and capture it for his empire. Victory would mean control of trade across the Mediterranean and a base for attacks on Spain, Sicily and southern Italy, even Rome. It would also mean elimination of Malta\'s defenders, the Knights Hospitaller, driven by the Ottomans from their base in Rhodes in 1522 and whose raids on his shipping had long been a thorn in his side. News of the Great Siege of Malta spread fear throughout Europe, though that turned to elation when, after four months of horrific fighting, the Ottomans withdrew, undermined by infighting between their leaders and the death of the highly-valued admiral, Dragut. The Knights Hospitaller had shown that Suleiman\'s forces could be contained, and their own order was reinvigorated. The image above is the Death of Dragut at the Siege of Malta (1867), after a painting by Giuseppe Cali. Dragut (1485 – 1565) was an Ottoman Admiral and privateer, known as The Drawn Sword of Islam and as one of the finest generals of the time.With Helen NicholsonProfessor of Medieval History at Cardiff UniversityDiarmaid MacCullochProfessor of the History of the Church at the University of OxfordandKate FleetDirector of the Skilliter Centre for Ottoman Studies and Fellow of Newnham College, CambridgeProducer: Simon Tillotson. | Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the man who was Henry II\'s Chancellor and then Archbishop of Canterbury and who was murdered by knights in Canterbury Cathedral (depicted by Matthew Paris, above). Henry believed that Becket owed him loyalty as he had raised him to the highest offices, and that he should agree to Henry\'s courts having jurisdiction over \'criminous clerics\'. They fell out when Becket agreed to this jurisdiction verbally but would not put his seal on the agreement, the Constitutions of Clarendon. The rift deepened when Henry\'s heir was crowned without Becket, who excommunicated the bishops who took part. Becket\'s tomb became one of the main destinations for pilgrims for the next 400 years, including those in Chaucer\'s Canterbury Tales where he was the \'blisful martir\'.

This is the little known story of the 1994 animated feature, The Lion King.Despite being one of Disney’s most cherished movies of all time, the Lion King was never expected to be such a massive hit.\xa0 The Lion King was considered a filler movie to tide people over until Disney released Pocahontas.\xa0Lion King was the first Disney animated movie based on a completely original story, it had a smaller budget and lesser known directors working on the film.Most of Disney’s “A-Team” animators chose to work on Pocahontas instead of Lion King because they worried a movie about a talking lion cub would be a flop.\xa0Those that ended up working on it were so dedicated that when an earthquake shutdown Disney studios in 1994, animators worked from their homes to make sure the film was completed on time.Despite these obstacles, The Lion King was a massive hit, making nearly a billion dollars at the box office and winning several awards including two Oscars.\xa0 In addition, it spawned the highest grossing Broadway production of all time and of course this year’s live action reboot with Beyoncé and Childish Gambino.The original Lion King also attracted its fair share of criticisms, including concerns that it portrayed hyenas in a negative light and some suggested it was knock off of a Japanese made American cartoon called Kimba the White Lion.If you enjoy the History of the 90s, please take a minute to rate it on Apple Podcasts or Google Podcasts, tell us what you think and share it with your friends.Contact:Twitter: @1990shistoryFacebook: @1990shistoryInstagram: @that90spodcastEmail: 90s@curiouscast.ca | On this episode Host Kathy Kenzora is looking back at how tabloid media had a feeding frenzy on the Long Island Lolita.\xa0In May 1992, a high school senior on Long Island, New York, went to the home of her much older ex-lover and shot his wife in the face.\xa017 year old Amy Fisher had been having an affair with 37 year old Joey Buttafuco for 18 months and was angry that he wanted to end the relationship.\xa0Within days, Amy was dubbed “The Long Island Lolita” and the story exploded in the media around the country.\xa0 Amy and the Buttafuco’s became household names overnight and tabloid newspapers and TV shows scrambled to dig up dirt on anyone involved with the story.\xa0This type of down and dirty pseudo-journalism was extremely common in the 90s, just think Lorena Bobbitt, Tanya Harding, Heidi Fleiss, Hugh Grant, George Michael and Peewee Herman.\xa0David Kamp, a contributing editor for Vanity Fair Magazine, wrote about the phenomenon in 1999 and dubbed the 90s the Tabloid Decade.Kamp, explains in this episode that the coverage of tabloid stories in the 90s was weirdly out of proportion thanks in part to the popularity of tabloid TV shows like A Current Affair, Hard Copy and Inside Edition.\xa0If you enjoy the History of the 90s, please take a minute to rate it on Apple Podcasts or Google Podcasts, tell us what you think and share it with your friends.Contact:Twitter: @1990shistoryFacebook: @1990shistoryInstagram: @that90spodcastEmail: 90s@curiouscast.caGuest:David KampTwitter: @MrKampwww.davidkamp.com | On History of the 90’s we’ll travel back in time through the stories that defined a decade.

The main character of the story, Leftenant Eric Peterkin, is a veteran of the trenches in Flanders and France as are nearly every other member of the gentleman’s club to which he belongs. Peterkin takes it upon himself to solve an unprecedented murder in the club when he suspects the case is not exactly going to be solved by the police. \xa0 Christopher Huang grew up in Singapore and moved to Canada when he was 17 years old. He returned to Singapore the following year for two years of military service, before going to McGill University in Montreal to study Architecture. He currently lives in Montreal, and these days he is pursuing the dream of writing full-time. Mr. Huang is a longtime fan of the "golden age" of detective fiction, and in that spirit he writes his debut novel in the hopes that readers will figure out on their own who the killer is. “A Gentleman’s Murder” is available through the Inkshares site, local booksellers, and Amazon. Links to the book will be provided in the episode description, as well on the website post and social media. Check out the book, and support an up and coming author.

We recall that the papacy of Gregory the Great is generally marked as the point where the city of Rome and the Roman church hit their low point in all the important areas a power needs: finance, politics, influence, culture and any other metric you can think of. Gregory began the process of reversing the backwards slide of Rome and the Roman Church. Let’s take a look at what happens in the next few decades in the papacy. This is a challenging time for popes of Rome, the Church in general and the entire western world. \xa0You can learn more about the History of Papacy and subscribe at all these great places:http://atozhistorypage.com/email: steve@atozhistorypage.comhttp://rss.acast.com/historyofthepapacy\xa0Get Your History of the Papacy Podcast Products Here: https://www.atozhistorypage.com/products\xa0On Social Media:§\xa0Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/HistoryOfThePapacyPodcast/§\xa0Twitter: https://twitter.com/atozhistory§\xa0Youtube Partner: The Study of Antiquity and the Middle Ages: §\xa0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxRSpkGOH_09pxKvgD8S5jQ\xa0Featured Podcasts:History of the Papacy Podcast on Himalayahttps://www.himalaya.com/History-podcasts/history-of-the-papacy-podcast-189396 Help out the show by ordering these books from Amazon!https://amzn.com/w/1MUPNYEU65NTF\xa0Music Provided by:"Danse Macabre" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)"Virtutes Instrumenti" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)"Virtutes Vocis" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)"Funeral March for Brass" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)"String Impromptu Number 1" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)Agnus Dei X - Bitter Suite Kevin MacLeaod (incomptech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Episode 86: Jacob Baradaeus – Changing the Game\xa0Description: Today we’re going to do another quick survey of what was going on in other parts of the Christian world. All too often, I have to skim over or entirely skip some really interesting bits of the history of the Church. Sometimes small pieces of history can make a big difference later on. That is the case with the topic of today’s episode. Jacob Baradaeus is one such person who didn’t quite fit into the narrative of previous episodes, but this humble monk who lived thousands of miles from Rome set off events that would make an enormous difference after his times. We will look at the life of Jacob Baradaeus and why he was so important not only to the history of Christianity, but also the Popes of Rome.\xa0You can learn more about the History of Papacy and subscribe at all these great places:http://atozhistorypage.com/email: steve@atozhistorypage.comhttp://rss.acast.com/historyofthepapacy\xa0Check us out on Himalaya! https://www.himalaya.com/en/show/189396\xa0Get Your History of the Papacy Podcast Products Here: https://www.atozhistorypage.com/products\xa0On Social Media:§\xa0Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/HistoryOfThePapacyPodcast/§\xa0Twitter: https://twitter.com/atozhistory§\xa0Youtube Partner: The Study of Antiquity and the Middle Ages: §\xa0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxRSpkGOH_09pxKvgD8S5jQ Help out the show by ordering these books from Amazon!https://amzn.com/w/1MUPNYEU65NTF\xa0Music Provided by:"Danse Macabre" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)"Virtutes Instrumenti" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)"Virtutes Vocis" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)"Funeral March for Brass" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)"String Impromptu Number 1" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)Agnus Dei X - Bitter Suite Kevin MacLeaod (incomptech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Sidetrack Episode 76\xa0ST 76 Quo Vadis with The Partial Historians\xa0Description: Today I have a really special episode I recorded with the great hosts of the podcast The Partial Historians.

Kim A. Wagner’s The Skull of Alum Bheg: The Life and Death of a Rebel of 1857(Oxford University Press, 2018) tells two stories. The first concerns the way in which he came into possession of the skull of a Muslim soldier executed by the British in the aftermath of the rebellion of 1857, also known as the Mutiny. The second story is Wagner’s attempted biography of Alum Bheg, a man who left no trace in the archive but whose head was taken as a battlefield trophy after his body was blown from a cannon in a grisly ceremony of revenge. Wagner uses this man’s life and death to explore British rule in India. The book raises important issues about the history of racialized violence in the colonial world. Wagner’s analysis is sure to challenge the ideas of those nostalgic for the Raj and for those who cherish India’s nationalist mythology.Michael G.

When the pollsters reversed the question―"Which country is Turkey\'s number one enemy in international relations?"―the United States came in second. How did Turkey\'s citizens come to hold such opposing views simultaneously? In The Limits of Westernization, Gürel explains this unique split and its echoes in contemporary U.S.-Turkey relations.Using Turkish and English sources, Gürel maps the reaction of Turks to the rise of the United States as a world-ordering power in the twentieth century. As Turkey transitioned from an empire to a nation-state, the country\'s ruling elite projected "westernization" as a necessary and desirable force but also feared its cultural damage. Turkish stock figures and figures of speech represented America both as a good model for selective westernization and as a dangerous source of degeneration. At the same time, U.S. policy makers imagined Turkey from within their own civilization templates, first as the main figure of Oriental barbarism (i.e., "the terrible Turk"), then, during the Cold War, as good pupils of modernization theory. As the Cold War transitioned to the War on Terror, Turks rebelled against the new U.S.-made trope of the "moderate Muslim." Local artifacts of westernization―folk culture crossed with American cultural exports―and alternate projections of modernity became tinder for both Turkish anti-Americanism and resistance to state-led modernization projects.Robert Elliott is a Ph.D. student in the Department of History, Duke University.Learn more about your ad choices.

In the last few decades, advances in technology and shifts in labor and farming policy have altered the way of life for tobacco farmers: family farms have largely been replaced by large-scale operations dependent on hired labor, much of it from other shores. However, the mechanical harvester and the H-2A guestworker did not put an end to tobacco culture but rather sent it in new directions and accelerated the change that has always been part of the farmer’s life.In When Tobacco Was King, Bennett examines the agriculture of the South’s original staple crop in the Old Bright Belt—a diverse region named after the unique bright, or flue-cured, tobacco variety it spawned. He traces the region’s history from Emancipation to the abandonment of federal crop controls in 2004 and highlights the transformations endured by blacks and whites, landowners and tenants, to show how tobacco farmers continued to find meaning and community in their work despite these drastic changes.Beth A.

How, when, and what do you like to read? Have you ever thought about the history of books and reading? How about shape, size, or texture of your book? Where do books go after they’ve been digitized? Harvard University professor Leah Price asks these questions and more in her new book, What We Talk About When We Talk About Books: The History and Future of Reading(Basic Books, 2019). Price begins her book by debunking the assumption that ebooks are more popular than print books, pointing out that in 2018 “sales revenue from hardbacks and paperbacks outstripped revenue from ebooks by more than $300 million.” She goes on to explore the history of books and reading from the changing social perceptions of reading, to reading on the move, to reading as method of political activism. Filled with cleverness and humor, Price surprises readers with interesting facts and anecdotes about books. As for the future of books and reading only time will tell, but Price believes that “the experience of immersion in a world made of words will survive if and only if readers continue to carve out places and times to have words with one another.”Leah Price is a Francis Lee Higginson Professor of English Literature at Harvard University, where she teaches courses on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature, gender, fiction, and the history of books. Her books include How to Do Things with Books in Victorian Britain and The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel.

New York produced some of the most well-known figures in suffrage history, including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, but Goodier and Pastorello have dedicated chapters to the activism of rural, black, working-class, and radical women alongside the supportive role played by men.

Still, Mauss\'s reflections were deeply tied to the context of interwar Europe and the French colonial expansion. Their normative dimension has been profoundly questioned after the age of decolonization. A century after Mauss, Grégoire Mallard, Professor Anthropology and Sociology at the Graduate Institute in Geneva, asks: what is the relevance of his ideas on gift exchanges and international solidarity? By tracing how Mauss\'s theoretical and normative ideas inspired prominent thinkers and government officials in France and Algeria, from Pierre Bourdieu to Mohammed Bedjaoui, Mallard\'s Gift Exchange: The Transnational History of a Political Idea (Cambridge University Press, 2019), adds a building block to our comprehension of the role that anthropology, international law, and economics have played in shaping international economic governance from the age of European colonization to the latest European debt crisis.

Yet, Lake Superior has experienced substantial environmental change—including today’s impressive but incomplete ecological recovery—in its existence, especially over the last 150 years. So argues the renowned environmental historian Nancy Langston in her latest book, Sustaining Lake Superior: An Extraordinary Lake in a Changing World (Yale University Press, 2019). An interdisciplinary scholar to her core, Langston ushers her training in science and history to tell a story of industrial development, ecological change, toxic pollution, and environmental injustice—and yet also one of ecological and human resilience. Much like the topic of her study, Langston moves fluidly across various political jurisdictions, from states and provinces, to national governments and international agreements, to First Nations and tribal territories. In so doing, she gives voice to a host of actors, including indigenous peoples (past and present), corporate executives and technicians in the pulp and paper and mining industries, government regulators and engineers, environmentalists, scientists, environmental justice activists, politicians, union workers, and many others. Sustaining Lake Superior illustrates the promises and limitations of ecological and human resilience, the inseparability of the local from the global, and the ongoing relevance of history for responding some of the most urgent challenges of climate change and environmental injustice.Nancy Langston is Distinguished Professor of Environmental History at Michigan Technological University.Joshua Nygren is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Central Missouri.

England in the Age of Shakespeare (Indiana University Press, 2019) draws together Black’s expansive reading in Shakespeare’s contexts with extensive knowledge of the canon of his plays. Black, a professor of history at Exeter University, reads the plays as evidence of Shakespeare’s interest in his changing world. As an English writer, rooted in the very distinctive theological and liturgical arguments of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Shakespeare offers a moral vision of a turbulent and contradictory world.Crawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast.

Dawley, an associate professor of history at Goucher College, explores this question in his new book Becoming Taiwanese: Ethnogenesis in a Colonial City, 1880s-1950s(Harvard University Press, 2019). Dawley traces the waves of newcomers to Taiwan beginning with Qing dynasty transplants from the southeastern coast of China. He then largely focuses on the Japanese colonial period and the first decade of ROC rule in Taiwan, relating significant encounters involving social organizations, religion, and social work. Dawley’s focus is the northern port city of Jilong (Keelung), which was a key site of Japanese modernization on the island due to its harbor and orientation toward Japan. Drawing from rich research conducted in Taiwan and Japan, Dawley highlights the practices of Japanese and Taiwanese local elites who acted as community gatekeepers, and in the process, uncovers how Taiwanese identity developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Laurie Dickmeyer is an Assistant Professor of History at Angelo State University, where she teaches courses in Asian and US history.

Since the nineteenth century, Blight suggests, there have been three predominant strains of Civil War memory, which Blight defines as reconciliationist, white supremacist, and emancipationist. The war has retained a political currency throughout the years, and the ability to control the memory of the Civil War has been, and continues to be, hotly contested. | Having dealt with the role of violence and the Supreme Court in bringing about the end of Reconstruction in his last lecture, Professor Blight now turns to the role of national electoral politics, focusing in particular on the off-year Congressional election of 1874 and the Presidential election of 1876. 1874 saw the return of the Democrats to majority status in the Senate and the House of Representatives, as voters sick of corruption and hurt by the Panic of 1873 fled the Republicans in droves. According to many historians, the contested election of 1876, and the "Compromise of 1877," which followed it, marked the official end of Reconstruction. After an election tainted by fraud and violence, Republicans and Democrats brokered a deal by which Republican Rutherford B. Hayes took the White House in exchange for restoration of "home rule" for the South. | This lecture focuses on the role of white southern terrorist violence in brining about the end of Reconstruction. Professor Blight begins with an account the Colfax Massacre. Colfax, Louisiana was the sight of the largest mass murder in U.S. history, when a white mob killed dozens of African Americans in the April of 1873. Two Supreme Court decisions would do in the judicial realm what the Colfax Massacre had done in the political. On the same day as the Colfax Massacre, the Supreme Court offered a narrow reading of the 14th Amendment in the Slaughterhouse cases, signaling a judicial retreat from the radicalism of the early Reconstruction years. The Cruikshank case, two years later, would overturn the convictions of the only three men sentenced for their involvement in Colfax, and marked another step away from reconstruction. Professor Blight concludes with the Panic of 1873 and the seemingly innumerable political scandals of the Grant Administration, suggesting the manner in which these events encouraged northerners to tire of the Reconstruction experiment by the early 1870s. | This lecture opens with a discussion of the myriad moments at which historians have declared an "end" to Reconstruction, before shifting to the myth and reality of "Carpetbag rule" in the Reconstruction South. Popularized by Lost Cause apologists and biased historians, this myth suggests that the southern governments of the Reconstruction era were dominated by unscrupulous and criminal Yankees who relied on the ignorant black vote to rob and despoil the innocent South. The reality, of course, diverges widely from this image. Among other accomplishments, the Radical state governments that came into existence after 1868 made important gains in African-American rights and public education. Professor Blight closes the lecture with the passage of the 15th Amendment, the waning radicalism of the Republican party after 1870, and the rise of white political terrorism across the South. | Professor Blight begins this lecture in Washington, where the passage of the first Reconstruction Act by Congressional Republicans radically altered the direction of Reconstruction. The Act invalidated the reconstituted Southern legislatures, establishing five military districts in the South and insisting upon black suffrage as a condition to readmission. The eventful year 1868 saw the impeachment of one president (Andrew Johnson) and the election of another (Ulysses S. Grant). Meanwhile, southern African Americans struggle to reap the promises of freedom in the face of economic disempowerment and a committed campaign of white supremacist violence. | Professor Blight continues his discussion of the political history of Reconstruction. The central figure in the early phase of Reconstruction was President Andrew Johnson. Under Johnson\'s stewardship, southern whites held constitutional conventions throughout 1865, drafting new constitutions that outlawed slavery but changed little else. When the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress reassembled late in 1865, they put a stop to Johnson\'s leniency and inaugurated Radical (or Congressional) Reconstruction, a process that resulted in the immediate passage of the Civil Rights bill and the Fourteenth Amendment, and the eventual passage of four Reconstruction Acts. The Congressional elections in 1866 and Johnson\'s disastrous "Swing Around the Circle" speaking tour strengthened Radical control over Congress. Each step of the way, Johnson did everything he could to obstruct Congressional Reconstruction, setting the stage for his impeachment in 1868. | In this lecture, Professor Blight begins his engagement with Reconstruction. Reconstruction, Blight suggests, might best be understood as an extended referendum on the meaning of the Civil War. Even before the war\'s end, various constituencies in the North attempted to control the shape of the post-war Reconstruction of the South. In late 1863, President Abraham Lincoln offered his lenient "Ten Percent Plan." Six months later, Congressional Republicans concerned by Lincoln\'s charity rallied behind the more radical provisions of the Wade-Davis Bill. Despite their struggle for control over Reconstruction, Congressional Radicals and President Lincoln managed to work together on two vital pieces of Reconstruction legislation in the first months of 1865--the 13th Amendment, which outlawed slavery in the United States, and the Freedmen\'s Bureau bill. | This lecture begins with a central, if often overlooked, turning point in the Civil War--the re-election of Abraham Lincoln in 1864. Although the concerted efforts of northern Peace Democrats and a palpable war weariness among the electorate made Lincoln\'s victory uncertain, timely Union victories in Atlanta and Mobile in September of 1864 secured Lincoln\'s re-election in November. This lecture concludes Professor Blight\'s section on the war, following Lee and Grant to Appomattox Courthouse, and describing the surrender of Confederate forces. The nature of Reconstruction and the future of the South, however, remained open questions in April of 1865. | Professor Blight uses Herman Melville\'s poem "On the Slain Collegians" to introduce the horrifying slaughter of 1864. The architect of the strategy that would eventually lead to Union victory, but at a staggering human cost, was Ulysses S. Grant, brought East to assume control of all Union armies in 1864. Professor Blight narrates the campaigns of 1864, including the Battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, and the siege of Petersburg. While Robert E. Lee battled Grant to a stalemate in Virginia, however, William Tecumseh Sherman\'s Union forces took Atlanta before beginning their March to the Sea, destroying Confederate morale and fighting power from the inside. Professor Blight closes his lecture with a description of the first Memorial Day, celebrated by African Americans in Charleston, SC 1865. | This lecture probes the reasons for confederate defeat and union victory. Professor Blight begins with an elucidation of the loss-of-will thesis, which suggests that it was a lack of conviction on the home front that assured confederate defeat, before offering another of other popular explanations for northern victory: industrial capacity, political leadership, military leadership, international diplomacy, a pre-existing political culture, and emancipation. Blight warns, however, that we cannot forget the battlefield, and, to this end, concludes his lecture with a discussion of the decisive Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July of 1863.', 'chan_desc': '(HIST 119) This course explores the causes, course, and consequences of the American Civil War, from the 1840s to 1877.

And, if you don’t know her name now, you’ve probably heard a few songs she is said to have inspired, like "Something" by The Beatles, "Wonderful Tonight" by Eric Clapton, and most famously, "Layla" by Eric Clapton when he was part of Derek & the Dominos. Oh, and did I mention that "Layla" was written as a love song for her while she was married to Eric’s best friend, George Harrison?

February 15th. Yup, you heard me right. February 15th, not the 14th.

Where he learns the Americans are once again mired in a World Cup fiasco.Fortunately, the smoking-hot time machine has returned him to a studio at WNYC, where Roger sits down to talk with Freakonomics Radio\xa0host Stephen Dubner about the 2018 World Cup, including the U.S. team’s failure to qualify for the tournament.They also deliver a primer on all the compelling drama that will unfold in Russia over the next month, including Lionel Messi’s quest for vindication with Argentina, Cristiano Ronaldo’s eight-pack, and the Icelandic underdogs who swear they have Viking blood coursing through their veins (but are also being coached by a part-time dentist.)Plus, Roger learns that Dubner, a soccer fan who hosts the podcast Footy for Two\xa0with his son Solomon, fell in love with the sport at his alma mater, Appalachian State University. The Division I upstart Mountaineers, as it turns out, were coached by none other than Hank Steinbrecher, the former U.S. Soccer executive and all-around soccer patriot who plays a key role throughout American Fiasco.Later, with the announcement of the 2026 World Cup host coming this week, Roger weighs in on whether the joint bid by the U.S., Mexico and Canada has a shot. And, he predicts that -- somehow, some way -- the United States will win the World Cup in 2018. | What do you do after you’ve just crashed and burned in a World Cup?That’s what the entire 1998 U.S. men’s national team was asking themselves, including the coach. The day after the team lost to Yugoslavia in its third and final World Cup game, Steve Sampson told the Washington Post that he wanted to remain head coach and that he wouldn’t let a few disgruntled players dictate his future. He even threatened to fine players who had aired their grievances in the press.\xa0\xa0But Sampson was smart enough to know he was headed for the exit. His boss, U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg, asked Steve to meet him for breakfast in Paris first thing Monday.Sampson remembers: “I offered my resignation because I felt it was the right thing to do because I had lost three games in a world championship. I didn\'t want Alan to feel as if he needed to fire me. Before he could get it out of his mouth, I offered to him to resign from the national team."An autographed U.S. national team jersey from the 1998 World Cup.Most of the players returned to the U.S., eager to forget the painful losses in France. But for Frankie Hejduk, the end of the World Cup marked a new beginning. He was actually kind of -- elated.Amid all the drama swirling around the U.S. national team, Hejduk and his agent negotiated a contract to play with Bayer Leverkusen, a top-flight German team. This California surfer and reluctant soccer star was headed to the big time in Europe.(Soccer Digest, November 1998)“It\'s crazy how that works out, right?” Hejduk remarks to Roger Bennett in American Fiasco. “It ended up changing my life in probably the best way ever because I wouldn\'t be here with you, doing interviews, I wouldn\'t be fishing. I wouldn\'t be hitting golf balls off my back deck.”Hejduk’s excitement, of course, was the exception. Most of the team returned to the U.S., eager to forget their humiliating defeat in France. More than anything, 1998 was supposed to be the year that this group of guys, playing this game, finally won over the great uncaring American audience to establish the game they loved as a truly major league sport.Roger Bennett with former U.S. national team defender Marcelo Balboa at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park in Denver, home of the Colorado Rapids. Balboa spent most of his MLS career with the Rapids and is a coach with the team’s development academy.\xa0\xa0“The boys had blown it. We had really lost of lot of respect from the world and internationally,” says striker Eric Wynalda. “Not until Brandi Chastain saved it in 1999, did we have a good feeling about the sport.”That was the year Chastain won the World Cup for the U.S. women’s team in a dramatic penalty shootout. Soccer was once again breakfast table conversation, because Chastain and Mia Hamm were plastered all over Wheaties boxes.\xa0It’s been 20 years since the men finished last at the World Cup. The petty grievances, the outsized vanities and the rank embarrassment have mostly faded away. Since then, soccer has arrived in the United States.Dozens of leagues are broadcast on American television. EA Sports FIFA isn’t just a best-selling video game; it’s an educational tool that is introducing generations to the rules, teams and stars of the sport. International icons Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi regularly poll in Americans’ top ten favorite sports heroes, outranking their N.F.L., M.L.B. and N.B.A. counterparts. This past season, 72,000 fans packed a stadium in Atlanta and set a Major League Soccer attendance record. The two previous records were held by, wait for it, Atlanta.And today, though Americans were embarrassed that the U.S. men failed to even qualify for the 2018 World Cup, worry not. The U.S. Women will — let’s pray — redeem us once again at the 2019 World Cup. After all, they’ve won three World Cups to date.As for the men’s team, hope still burns in the hearts of American soccer evangelists and 1998 survivors like Hank Steinbrecher.“We\'re Americans,” Steinbrecher tells Roger in the final moments of the podcast. “Let\'s climb Everest. Let\'s go to the moon. Let\'s cure cancer. Go for it. Let\'s win a World Cup.”\xa0 | So far, the 1998 World Cup was going pretty badly for the U.S. men’s national team. They’d just played the Germans, losing 2-0 when they’d been counting on a tie. The next two games, against Iran and Yugoslavia respectively, now mattered more than ever.First up, Iran.As of game day -- June 21, 1998 -- Iran had been America’s sworn enemy for the past 20 years or so. Memories of the 1979 hostage crisis in Tehran still made American blood boil. Even the White House was concerned, calling the secretary general of the U.S. Soccer Federation, Hank Steinbrecher, to confirm the U.S. was favored to win. And they were.The Iranians had also lost their opening game. In fact, Iran had never won a World Cup match. Most of their players had not played outside of their own country. For the first time in this World Cup, the U.S. team was not the underdog. They were determined to get as many points as they could. They needed a win before they faced the formidable Yugoslavian team.U.S. and Iran players in the tunnel.\xa0So for the Iran game, Sampson shifted the team’s strategy to all-out attack. He made five lineup changes -- that’s essentially half the team -- and abandoned the complex 3-6-1 formation he’d employed for the past two months.Instead, Sampson organized the team in a 3-5-2 setup that uses two forwards. He went a step further, slotting in an additional forward (Joe-Max Moore) in what was normally a key defensive midfield role. Sure, the team would be vulnerable to counterattacks, but that was Sampson’s whole point: attack first, attack again, then keeping attacking.Three minutes into the game, 26-year-old forward\xa0Brian McBride came close to scoring a header in his first-ever World Cup. The Americans had set the tone: they meant business. They continued to outplay Iran during most of the first half, except in one key way: The U.S. could not put the ball in the net.After McBride hit the post, Claudio Reyna did the same. The Americans were doing everything right -- just an inch off the mark.But in the 41st minute, Iranian midfielder Hamid Estili did not miss with a perfect header into the far corner of the goal. The U.S. returned to the locker room down 1-0.Press officer Jim Froslid recalls that the locker room was devoid of positive energy. “You\'re 1-nil down. You\'re dominating. This is a moment where you know you can come back. Right?”McBride says, “I don’t remember anybody getting fired up and screaming at each other or yelling something positive. No.”The U.S. continued to play dominating football, but the goals just wouldn’t come. Meanwhile, Sampson’s all-out attack strategy had left the American side of the field vulnerable. Iran’s Mehdi Mahdavikia launched a one-man counterattack in the 84th minute, leaving a defender in the dust and rocketing the ball off U.S. goalkeeper Kasey’s fingers.McBride finally scored a goal four minutes later -- the only goal the U.S. would notch in the entire tournament. The Americans could not equalize. They lost the game, 2-1, ensuring that the team would not advance past the group stage. The World Cup was effectively over.After the game, the players went back to blasting Sampson in the press. Jeremy Schaap of ESPN was there that night and he remembers it “as the darkest place I’ve ever seen in sports.”Dark indeed, the day a team has blown its chance at World Cup glory. Four days later, the U.S. had to play Yugoslavia, but the game was a formality at this point. And again, they lost. This time one-nil. The U.S. men’s national team had made a fool of American soccer in front of the whole world. A reckoning was coming.\xa0 | On June 15, 1998, the U.S. men’s national team was waiting to kick off their first World Cup game. The players warmed up in the tunnel before taking the field at Parc des Princes stadium in Paris. Their German opponents were waiting there as well.Of the three games the Americans were set to play, this first one was expected to be the hardest. Germany was (and still is) one of best national teams on the planet. The U.S. team was hoping for a tie, to stay in the running for the tournament’s next round.Striker Eric Wynalda had played professionally in Germany, and he knew how good these guys were. “I knew Olaf Thon and Kohler. Christian Wörns. Those guys were laughing at me. And I\'ll never forget Kohler saying, ‘Got no chance. It\'s one against three.’ I think I just responded, ‘I know. You\'re right.’”Specifically, the Germans were laughing at the American’s team’s new on-field formation, the 3-6-1. As implemented by U.S. coach Steve Sampson, the strategy called for three defenders, six midfielders and just one striker to carry the scoring burden. Wynalda was that lonely striker, whose only company would be three intimidating German defenders.This 3-6-1 was rarely used in international soccer. It relies heavily on youth and speed. It requires players to be well-drilled in their roles and understand each other’s positions. When the 3-6-1 works, the formation is fast and lethal. But when it doesn’t, it can destroy the team almost before kick-off.Most important: A complex strategy change requires buy-in from players, something that was in short supply on Sampson’s roster. Lest we forget: The team’s veterans were on the bench, the newbies were on the field, and everyone had been going stir-crazy in a secluded chateau.So it wasn’t surprising that early on, in the 9th minute, the Germans took the lead with a corner kick. And in the 65th minute, they stole another goal. The Americans were outclassed and they were learning it in the worst way possible. Try as they might, the Americans couldn’t redeem the score. After 90 minutes, the game ended at 2-0.Yet the loss gave the embittered veterans the opportunity they wanted: an opening to vent. Even though the U.S. team was still in the running for the trophy, some players went straight to the media.Alexi Lalas blamed the chateau: "We were isolated in the middle of France, then plopped down in the middle of Paris where it\'s like a circus."Roy Wegerle lambasted the 3-6-1, saying it was "twice the work and half the help.”Eric Wynalda blamed the inexperienced starters. "You could tell some of us were playing for the first time in a World Cup," he told the LA Times’ Mike Penner.Tab Ramos criticized Sampson’s decision to bench veterans Lalas, Balboa and Agoos. He told the Washington Post: “Obviously, you don\'t have to agree, and I don\'t.”Weeks of the team’s internal grumbling, sniping and bad blood was now making headlines back home. Not only had the team lost their first game on the world stage, but they’d also lost their unity. How could they pull it together in time for their next two games against Iran and Yugoslavia? In each case, they had a chance of winning. But the team had become its own worst enemy. | When the U.S. men’s national team departed JFK International Airport for France on June 5, 1998, many players assumed they were headed straight into the heart of World Cup action.Fourteen hours later, they arrived in the middle of nowhere.It’s common for elite national teams to train in isolation during the final days before the World Cup. Argentina was holed up in the town of L’Etrat, in the Loire Valley. The English were hiding out on a golf resort an hour west of Nantes.U.S. head coach Steve Sampson wanted the same thing for his players. “We were staying at the Chateau de Pizay, in one of the finest hotels in the world,” he tells Roger Bennett in episode 5 of American Fiasco. “We had a five-star chef preparing meals for these players. We had a magnificent training ground. France, Brazil and England all stayed there and I felt it was good enough for our national team.”However, the Chateau de Pizay was surrounded by 130 acres of beaujolais vineyards in Saint-Jean-d\'Ardières, four hours away from Paris.Defender\xa0Marcelo Balboa remembers his frustration. “You\'re like, \'We\'re isolated up in a mountain, in a vineyard where I have to ride a bike into town 10 minutes just to get out and go do something.\' We were like, \'Why are we being isolated? Why are we being secluded? Why are we being put by ourselves out here?\'”Jeremy Schaap, then an ESPN reporter embedded with the team, explains: “Look, mostly these were guys who were expecting something out of the World Cup akin to what Olympic athletes get out of the Olympic Village.”“We wanted this to be ridiculously special for the players,” says Sampson. “It cost the Federation a lot more money than they anticipated.”But his players just couldn’t -- or wouldn’t -- hack it. In the Chateau, their gilded prison, the inmates were going a little batty.“It looked great from the outside,” remarks forward Eric Wynalda. But inside? “It was Hotel California, man, and we were inside those walls trying to figure out how we could just get through the next day.”Everyone had their way of coping. High-stakes poker games were popular. Midfielder\xa0Preki\xa0Radosavljevic soon amassed enough cash to fill a sock he slung over his shoulder. (“Most of it was mine,” notes Wynalda.) Once, press officer Jim Froslid saw a pot that was about half his salary. Needless to say, he didn’t join the game.Forward\xa0Brian McBride read the New Testament cover to cover for the first (and only) time. Midfielder\xa0Brian Maisonneuve told a reporter he was reading les pages jaunes … the yellow pages. Meanwhile, veteran midfielders\xa0Cobi Jones and\xa0Earnie Stewart were spotted having conversations with the local ducks.Each of these men, everyone on that team, had devoted his professional and personal life to this moment. They’d all made enormous sacrifices to be here, had beaten out every other American to make the squad, and then competed against each other to lock down starting roles. They’d desperately tried to impress their coach even when they did not understand what he wanted from them.They had lost their captain. And now, they felt they were losing their minds.On June 14th, 1998, the first kick-off was just a night away. Come morning, the U.S. would battle Germany on the football field. The whole world would be watching. | The U.S. men’s national team had done it. They’d qualified for the 1998 World Cup. Now it was time to find out which teams they would face.The World Cup draw\xa0determines the matchups for the tournament’s first round, the so-called group stage. Imagine the Powerball drawing on your local TV station, except this one is watched by half a billion people around the world.Instead of drawing lottery numbers, a high-ranking FIFA official plucks balls from a bowl. Each ball contains the name of a country. When its ball is drawn, that country is slotted into one of eight groups consisting of four national teams.In other words, three years of hard work, international travel and swaggering self-confidence can all be erased by three little plastic balls.\xa0\xa0Hank Steinbrecher, who was then the secretary general of U.S. Soccer, attended the draw, which was held in an outdoor stadium in Marseilles on a chilly, windy December evening.“So the first ball we draw is Germany,” he explains. ”And I distinctly remember sitting in my seat, saying, ‘Oh great. We’ve had two wars with them. They’re only the best team in the damn world and we’re playing Germany to start out with!’ Next is Iran! ‘Oh great. They have our hostages. This is going to be a diplomatic nightmare.’”“Next one is Yugoslavia!” he continues. \xa0“Which is a great team and we are currently bombing them. So I’m thinking, ‘This is going to be a whirlwind of warfare.’”Before facing these opponents in France, however, the U.S. team still had many challenges in the coming months. The players had to compete with each other to secure a spot on the final team roster. And coach Steve Sampson introduced a complex, new on-field formation, the 3-6-1, which changed everyone’s roles and prioritized speed and younger players. In turn, the team’s most veteran and high-profile players began to ride the bench.Meanwhile, a newcomer arrived with just weeks to go before the World Cup.\xa0David Regis hadn’t helped the U.S. team qualify for this World Cup. In fact, he wasn’t even a U.S. citizen: he was born in Martinique, a territory of France, and had been playing professionally in France and Germany. But Regis was married to an American and at the behest of Sampson, was racing to get his U.S. citizenship. While Regis was doing that, he was also competing for a starting position against the team’s beloved left back, Jeff Agoos.Agoos was no stranger to this gauntlet. He’d been cut from the World Cup team in 1994 at the last minute. He’d been so upset at the time that he burned his U.S. jersey in a fireplace. Fast forward four years, and Agoos feared he might once again be left behind.On June 2 -- just two days before the team was scheduled to depart for France -- Sampson finally submitted his World Cup roster to FIFA. Twenty two players would represent the U.S.A. at the 1998 World Cup, including both Agoos and Regis. But Regis would be starting and Agoos, the veteran, would be watching from the bench.Regis was elated and even teared up during the national anthem in his first World Cup game. But the team’s core of older players, who identified with Agoos and his plight, were none too pleased. A storm was brewing on the horizon.\xa0 | American Fiasco isn’t Roger’s only podcast gig. Along with his great friend (and fellow bald) Michael Davies, he hosts the soccer show Men in Blazers. That show’s unofficial slogan -- “Soccer. America’s sport of the future, as it has been since 1972” -- is based on the hilarious expectation that soccer is forever tomorrow’s sport. Always on the horizon, having never quite arrived.When Roger first came to the U.S. in the 1993, Americans were not just inured to soccer’s charms. They actively disliked it. Roger was fascinated by their malice -- and about what’s important to Americans in sports. Even today, with the rise of MLS and growth of the game nationwide, soccer still has its skeptics who savor a good dig at the game.In this bonus episode, Roger sits down with\xa0Dan Katz, better known as Big Cat. The\xa0Barstool Sports personality and host of Pardon My Take explains why he and other Americans won’t take soccer seriously, in part because of its time-honored association with orange slices and Oreos.\xa0 | John Harkes\xa0was off the team. It didn’t make any sense. Harkes was practically born to play on the national team. He grew up in Kearny, N.J. -- nicknamed “Soccertown U.S.A.” -- where everyone he knew was the kids and grandkids of Scottish and Irish immigrants, and a love of soccer was in their DNA.“We played constantly,” remembers Harkes. “We got kicked off the baseball fields, we got kicked off the American football fields, we got the ball stolen by the police and then had to have our dads go down and get the ball back again so we could play again that night.”That non-stop playing paid off. Harkes was recruited by the University of Virginia and in his senior year, he quit college and joined the U.S. national soccer team. In 1990, the 23-year-old helped the team qualify for the World Cup for the first time in four long decades.He was so good that he got picked up by one of the oldest pro teams in England, Sheffield Wednesday. It was a tough initiation for the young American, but he found a way to prove himself: with a blast from 35 feet out that flew past one of England’s best goalkeepers of all time, a legend name Peter Shilton. It was Harkes’ way of saying, “Hey, Americans can do it.”But there was no time for celebrating. “Don’t get caught up in your emotions,” he told himself. “You’re an American. You’re trying to break in here. Get back to business.” Because professional soccer has an unforgiving, unsentimental culture. All that matters is the game.\xa0\xa0By the time Harkes returned to the U.S. in 1996 to play for the shiny new Major League Soccer, he had become a legit international star – as well as one of People magazine’s 50 Most Beautiful – and was named Captain for Life by team manager Steve Sampson. Harkes was funny, confident, well-liked and respected by his teammates.And he was Eric Wynalda’s best friend.They had been teammates for eight years and worked well together. Harkes could take the pressure off when Wynalda got too intense. They were partners in locker-room comedy and on the team bus did scenes from Dumb and Dumber or Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.But Steve Sampson didn’t always appreciate Harkes’ breezy personality. And on April 14, 1988, Sampson called a press conference and announced that John Harkes – the man who’d become arguably the centerpiece of American soccer – was off the team.The announcement shocked everyone – reporters, fans, players and Harkes himself: “I was just like, ‘Wow. I don’t understand.’”At the time, Sampson vaguely cited discipline and leadership issues. In American Fiasco, Sampson boils his decision down to three strikes -- only two of which were made public at the time of Harkes’ ouster. \xa0Strike one: Sampson says Harkes, a midfielder used to playing at the center of it all, initially refused to move to left back during an exhibition match against Holland. (Harkes disputes this, saying he was merely reluctant.) Strike two: Two days later, Sampson says Harkes and other players went out on the town and trashed a hotel room. (Harkes also disputes this.)Strike three is a longer story.The last straw for Sampson involved allegations that Harkes was having an affair with another player’s wife. Upon hearing the news, Sampson says he knew immediately that he’d have to kick Harkes \xa0off the team. “There were lines that you do not cross over. You don’t have an affair with another player’s wife." And it wasn’t just another player, but his best friend, Eric Wynalda.The story behind that third strike wasn’t made public for 12 years, until Wynalda himself revealed it on his soccer talk show, Fox Football Fone-in. He and co-host Nick Webster were discussing an English player being accused of having an affair with the ex-girlfriend of a teammate. \xa0Webster said, “Well, you’ve had experience with this, Eric.” At that point, Wynalda explained to viewers, “there were allegations that John Harkes had been, had an inappropriate relationship with my wife and he was removed from the team for that reason.”\xa0\xa0Sampson then broke his silence about the matter and spoke to reporters. “It was a relief, for me, because, finally, people heard the truth,” he says. (John Harkes declined to discuss allegations of an affair.)Many players were surprised to learn an off-field issue had subtracted Harkes’ on-field skills and leadership from the team.\xa0Alexi Lalas was angry. Had he known the reason at the time, he says he would have said, “I want him on my team because he’s a good soccer player. As a professional, I will forgive you a lot as long as you’re going to help me win.”Even Eric Wynalda was against Harkes getting sacked. “I thought that if I can handle it, Steve should have been able to handle it. Ripping John off that team was ripping the heart out of our team.”All these years later, Steve Sampson doesn’t regret his decision, but he’s learned an important life lesson from it: “That to be a principled man, always comes with consequences.” | Fresh off their impressive showing at the Copa America tournament, the U.S. team was feeling ready to take on the world. Or, more specifically, the World Cup. That was coming up in 1998 and the players were primed to begin the qualification run.“We were a confident team,” remembers defender Marcelo Balboa. “When we walked out on the field, we knew that we could beat anybody in the world.”But exactly who would walk out on that field was the question nagging at every player. Even if the team qualified for the World Cup, not every player would make the final 22-man roster. Even fewer would get starting roles.The yearlong qualification process, thus, became a kind of ongoing audition for the World Cup roster, with Steve Sampson serving as casting director. And with his interim-coach days now behind him, he felt confident about making decisions, even bold ones that would not make everyone happy. \xa0His first big move was to take the title of team captain away from the calm-under-pressure veteran Balboa and give it to the scrappy, tenacious Jersey boy, John Harkes. And this title didn’t come with “interim” before it. In fact, Harkes was known as “Captain for Life.”The change didn’t put Balboa in the best frame of mind for the march toward the World Cup. To make it, the U.S. would have to survive an initial round of six games and qualify for a second round of 10 games, dubbed the “Hex.”For players, this test is both physical and psychological. Stifling heat, waterlogged fields and in every city they traveled to — a stadium filled with people who truly hated them.Balboa remembers a dummy dressed in a U.S. national team uniform that was swung from the top tier of a stadium with a noose around its neck.\xa0Jeff Agoos says a bag of urine was probably the worst thing thrown at him — though the C batteries hurt, too.It was an added degree of difficulty for players who were battling other teams and trying to outshine one another for playing time.The next big move by Sampson as he started to whittle the team down was to bench the team’s highest-profile player, the closest thing it had to a star, Alexi Lalas. “It sucked,” says Lalas. “Because I felt that you dance with the ones that brung you.” But the players weren’t the only ones with jobs on the line. U.S. Soccer was already courting the Portuguese coach\xa0Carlos Queiroz as a replacement for Sampson. \xa0By November 1997, there were just three games to go in the “Hex” and the American position was tenuous. With doubt setting in, the team arrived in Mexico City for a crucial game, knowing the U.S. had never beaten or even tied Mexico on their home turf.Once inside The Estadio Azteca, the team would battle the triple threat of altitude, smog and the noise of 105,000 frenzied Mexican fans. The Americans played shorthanded after Jeff Agoos was sent off the field with an early red card. Yet, somehow, they tied, 0-0. Their performance was so impressive that the Mexican fans gave the American team a standing ovation as they left the field.That game proved to the team they could win anywhere in the world. Just one week after Mexico, the U.S. qualified for the 1998 World Cup in a shutout game against Canada.Cue: the celebration. The flowing champagne, giddy embraces and heartfelt speeches were all captured for posterity, including that moment Sampson threw an arm around his Captain for Life, John Harkes, and said to him, “Your third World Cup. Can you believe it?”But not all the players celebrating in the locker room that day would actually get to play at the 1998 World Cup. Some of the team’s most experienced veterans would go to France, but never set foot on the field. Others wouldn’t make it there at all, including, of all people, John Harkes.Just two months before the World Cup, the Captain for Life was captain no more.\xa0 | 1994 World Cup? America nailed it. Regional rival Mexico? Crushed ’em in D.C.! Now it was time for the United States national team to prove it could be successful outside the U.S.In July 1995, the team traveled to Uruguay for the Copa America, a battle royal among South American nations. The U.S. was an invited guest that would face some of the toughest teams in the world.Little did the players know they would also have to scrap with their bosses at the U.S. Soccer Federation.It all started on the flight to the tournament. There hadn’t been time to finish negotiating players’ contracts before the flight took off. Six hours into the flight, a piece of paper with the Federation’s terms began circulating among the players.They gathered in the back of the plane to discuss a major sticking point in the proposal: Players would not be compensated equally. Instead, a sliding scale based on experience with the national team would dictate compensation.“It was divide and conquer,” explains star forward Eric Wynalda, noting that younger players with few games under their belts were being asked to play for glory – and nothing else. “It was, let’s get the veteran players to comply and screw everybody else.” Even those who would benefit knew it would go against the very thing that had made them successful: being a team.That team, as a whole, made the decision that they would not play, much less practice, until the issue was resolved.Upon their arrival in Paysandu, Uruguay, the players’ bus was met with a crowd of soccer-obsessed locals bearing signs and warm regards. This unexpected celebrity treatment was due, in part, to the high visibility of American stars like\xa0Alexi Lalas during the previous summer’s World Cup. \xa0But also, the Americans were slated to play Uruguay’s archrival, Argentina, in the Copa. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, as the old saying goes. The people of Paysandu began to follow the team around town.The hotel where the U.S. was staying had windows across the front and adoring locals would press their noses to the glass to watch the players hang out as long-distance negotiations took place via fax.“We played a lot of backgammon and we drank a lot of cappuccinos in that lobby,” says Wynalda.Adds Lalas: “It was almost like a museum exhibition. ‘Come see the Americans!’”Back home, Federation secretary general Hank Steinbrecher saw the negotiations differently. From his perspective, U.S. Soccer had invested a lot in these players and now thought they were an “ungrateful lot.”Many faxes later, Steinbrecher had had enough: \xa0“You’re going to put a noose over our neck and a bullet to our head? Screw you. You’re finding your own way home and I’m bringing down the Olympic team.”Faced with the threat of scabs, the players reacted with, “Great. Go for it.” They felt confident that if crowds of Uruguayans came to the hotel just to watch Marcelo Balboa, Alexi Lalas and Eric Wynalda sip coffee, Steinbrecher wouldn’t actually replace them in the biggest tournament in South America.Some believe Steinbrecher blinked first. Steinbrecher says they “came to a compromised position.” In either case, the players got their money.There was time for just one practice before the first game of the Copa and Coach Steve Sampson warned his players, “You better go out and prove that you deserve that money.”And prove it they did. They won their first game 2-1, against Chile. It was the first time the U.S. had beaten a South American team on South American soil since the inaugural World Cup in 1930.After a brief 1-0 setback against Bolivia, all thoughts were on their next opponent, Argentina. The Argentine playing style is singular – as brutal as it is beautiful. No player personified both sides of this style more than the legendary Diego Maradona. His playing days were over and he was watching from the stands. But the team on the field was no less fearsome. One of their most talented and ruthless players was another Diego: Diego Simeone.Warming up in the tight confines of the hallway outside the locker room, Simeone started talking trash to Wynalda. A few stretches later, Wynalda warned Simeone, “I’m going to rip your face off.” Then Wynalda grabbed Simeone by the throat. All of this was before the game even started.The truth is, the U.S. team would have been happy with a tie. The players had grown up watching the Diego Maradona era of Argentine soccer. When Alexi Lalas was 16, he watched Argentina play in the World Cup in person. Nine years later, he would score a goal against them.The U.S. struck twice in the first half, then Wynalda tacked one on, making the final score 3-0. The Americans had never dominated an opponent this powerful in quite this way.What happened on the field was impressive, but what came next is soccer lore. The guys were boisterously celebrating with cold beers, when the room suddenly went quiet. The crowd parted to make way for none other than Diego Maradona, who emotionally shook each player’s hand. “I’m not crying because Argentina has lost,” he explained. “I’m crying because the Americans played such beautiful football.”The U.S. ended up placing fourth at the Copa, which was an astonishing feat. They beat a team no one had thought was touchable. And they coaxed tears from a legitimate soccer god. They were starting to believe in themselves and work as a team, on and off the field.\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'Join host Roger Bennett of Men in Blazers for this story of the U.S. men’s soccer team that swaggered onto the international stage and set out to win the 1998 World Cup in France.
