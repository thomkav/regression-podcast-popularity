LESSONS: Often times simplicity is more powerful than complexity. Take accountability for things. Did you open it? Then close it? Did you make a mess? Leave crumbs behind? Clean it. Did you break it? Then you must fix it and / or replace it. Did you use it? Return better than you found it!

Host & Show Notes: Zach Even - Esh © 2019 Spartan | Dr. Lara Pence says: We are a society of human beings that engage in relationships, look for connection, and are looking for ways that we fit into the pie of community. So it’s no wonder that we can get activated in relationships and with the people that we come in contact with. Getting activated is often best identified by feeling irritable, angry, frustrated, or ‘hot’ when you\'re in connection with someone. We all get activated but understanding where the activation is coming from and how to work through it can be an important factor when trying to make the next best choice. LESSONS: We can all become activated in relationships and when we are in engagement with another person. A few questions to ask yourself when you feel yourself getting activated: Where is this coming from? (insecurity / fear) Does this person remind me of someone? How can I breathe, take perspective, and make the next best choice? Do I need to circle back with this person (or myself) in order to get more clear on what was activated?

And we aren’t very good at taking accountability for our own role in this absent-minded behavior. Time management matters when we’ve got so much happening AND when distractibility is so available to us. But you’ve got to be able to integrate some time management skills into your daily life in a way that supports all of your busy activities rather than restricts them. LESSONS: Time management is important in order for you to execute on choices that move you forward. Use these steps to help you manage your time: Prioritize Say No Commit Write this process down!

It fired me up SO much because I felt that I was ending my day on a WEAK note. NO good!  LESSONS: No matter what happens between the morning and night time, you can ALWAYS start AND finish the day with something Strong & Positive. Choose something that Benefits YOU & Betters YOU. It can be 1 set of push-ups, squats or burpees. Maybe it’s some stretching. You can also write in a gratitude journal. Put your phone away during the start and end of the day, this ensures you will do something for YOU!

Host & Show Notes: Zach Even - Esh © 2019 Spartan | Life is filled with tough choices, especially if you are looking to challenge yourself and elevate your own life. We are wired to look for comfort but sometimes the tough choices put us in a position of discomfort no matter which you choose. Keep in mind that avoiding tough choices is never going to benefit you - but rather leave you unfulfilled and pining for more, despite the ease of being unchallenged. LESSONS: Tough choices will exist and sometimes there is no “good” choice. Tap into your value system to help you make a choice that is in alignment with what matters to you. Remember, no matter the choice - if you are open to it - there will be wisdom gained. Trust in yourself - if you focus on values and are open to learning - you will win.

Specifically I am talking about my back squat, it’s been over two years and my back squat PR won’t move. I back squat often, I train variations like paused back squats, low volume, high volume, I worked on my glute strength and activation, strengthened my hamstrings, worked on bracing...I feel like I’ve done all the things and while my PR has improved as far as coming up out of it faster I feel like I’ve hit a wall. Please tell me I have not reached my true potential?10:45 - Training - What approach would you suggest to build up hamstrings & glutes for someone who sits a lot for their job? Seems like whenever I try to do squats I’m wrecked for days.17:35 - Nutrition - Are you putting out any other recipe books in the future?\xa019:25 - Supplement - At what point would using adaptogens be recommended vs just reducing stress?21:25 - Random - If you could only drink one coffee for the rest of your life what would it be & how would it be prepared?23:22 - What are your current physique goals?28:30 - When is it safe to actively lose fat after you recovered from hypothalamic amenorrhea that lasted years rather than months? What is the safest way to lose some of the weight you had to gain to get your period back providing there’s no deadlines and no performance goals?32:23 - Proper way of measuring vegetables like squash which has hit amounts of water prior to cooking and is soggy when cooked. Weight changes so it is a bit confusing to be accurate35:54 - Ok, so I want to tackle a marathon during my 35th year of life, so, January sometime. If so , I want to challenge my bod to do an ultramarathon, relays, maybe a hike to Machu Picchu. Best training plan you have and best way to avoid overuse injuries along the way?38:10 - I would like to know your opinion on power naps. Are they beneficial after a rough or short night? Or does it hinder your sleep in the evening?40:00 - Recommendations on lifting for endurance athletes42:35 - How would you personally go about trying to maintain as close to your recent photoshoot physique as you could?46:35 - When coming out of a cutting phase and starting a reverse diet, how many cals would you recommend to increase each week to minimize fat gain?50:07 - Are cold showers every day / ice baths / /cold packs etc. beneficial for someone who\'s almost always freezing in the cold months ?

I started from 1500 cal and have worked up to 1750 cal, and now recently my bodyweight has increased by 0.7-1kg in two weeks. (I added 50 cal every week and carbs have gone from 140-150 to 200-220g). I haven’t noticed any unusual fat gains/water retention. Should I Stop adding calories and make this my new maintenance or is this normal and I should go on with my reverse diet? I am not really happy that my cal intake is this low, but I need to be in the weight class in powerlifting comps. I am just worried that I start maintenance too soon… few stats about me; 5’2” and 114.5kg (went down from 130lbs to 112lbs), training 4x a week and have increased training volume and intensity with the reverse diet.\xa047:15 - Since February I have been weightlifting and have lost about 30lbs. I am down to about 114 lbs and 5’3 and thought that this would be my goal (below it even) but i still have some stomach fat and other fat i would like to lose. I am burnt out of being in fat loss and am dying to get calories up so i can gain strength in the gym. I feel my newbie gains are slowing down and it’s getting harder to get stronger, and I\'m really excited to move on to getting stronger at maintenance. I\'m eating about 1400 right now and walk 20k steps a day (student) and my losing has slowed to about .6 lb average a week. should I keep at it for a while longer to try and lose the stomach fat? or start reversing our? thank you in advance for the advice!!\xa050:50 - I follow your page and I loved macros when I started them. I started seeing results and was consistently losing about a pound a week, it was motivation to keep going, I’m the type of person who dives in head first to what I do. However, I suddenly stopped losing weight and even started gaining. I was still super compliant with my macros and my weights. I was irregular so my first thought was fiber, maybe my cut in carbs caused insufficient fiber. Well I upped my carbs but I’m still below maintenance, became more regular but I’m still gaining weight. I have been on these macros a little over 12 weeks so I’m thinking I should’ve gone ahead and taken a diet break to eat at maintenance, but honestly I’m scared to lose my progress and my weight has been slowly increasing anyway, what are your thoughts\xa055:20 - I need an opinion on my prep macros 4 weeks out..----Get Your Free Copy of The Nutrition Hierarchy, HERE\xa0Learn How We Coach: Read This Case Study ArticleTop 4 Episodes:- Nutritional Periodization- Nutrition FAQ- Training FAQ- My StoryThings Mentioned:- Dr. Jose Antonio Protein Study\xa0- Mike Millner\'s Podcast (Interview with myself)\xa0- Jason Phillips Interview\xa0- BBP Coaching----You can get access to ALL of our content in one place, now:www.boomboomperformance.com/linksJoin The Boom Boom Elite (BBP’s Membership Site) to receive exclusive content and interviews, monthly training programs, bonus eBooks, the private coaching forum, and more by visiting www.boomboomperformance.com/eliteASK BOOM-BOOM YOUR QUESTION HERE! : www.boomboomperformance.com/podcastCheck out all of our e-books by visiting https://www.boomboomperformance.com/productsTo Apply For Coaching With Boom Boom Performance, visit – htthttp://bit.ly/Coaching-PodSocial Links:Blog – www.boomboomperformance.comFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/boomboomperformance/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cody.boomboom/\xa0YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/user/BoomBoomPerformanceEmail – info@boomboomperformance.com | Today’s guest is the training legend, Todd Durkin!

One of the main purposes of our metabolism is to convert what we eat or drink into energy. And from an exercising point of view, our metabolism is linked to our energy expenditure, or in other words, the number of calories we burn.\xa0Our metabolic rate is affected by several factors, such as age, gender, and genes. Hence, it cannot be artificially influenced by any gadget. However, there are certain natural “remedies” that can help boost your metabolism for a short period of time.\xa0But if you\'re looking for something more sustained, your focus should be around optimal nutrition and/or increasing your muscle mass. Press play to learn what innovations are out there that will help you achieve these and hopefully lead to boosting your metabolism in the long run! | This week on the 20 Minute Fitness podcast\'s\xa0 ‘Why I Built This’ show, we are honored to introduce you to someone with an extremely inspiring and empowering story: Michael Kuech, the Co-Founder of Your Super. Once an aspiring pro tennis player, Michael’s life took a dramatic turn when he was diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately, he managed to recover and one of his secret weapons turned out to be a daily dosage of superfoods, "prescribed" to him by his partner Kristel De Groot. Eventually, all of this inspired the two of them to found Your Super, a direct-to-consumer nutritional supplements company.If you would like to learn about the full story of how superfoods actually helped Michael through his hard times and why Your Super is very different from your typical nutrition supplement company, then you should definitely stay tuned!Three Things You Will Learn1) Superfoods At Your SuperEven though superfoods only got hyped in Western societies a couple of years ago, they go a long way in the Eastern world. These ancient veggies and fruits are extremely high in nutrients and have been used for decades as alternative medicine by different cultures.Maximizing their benefits and making them easily consumable, Michael and Kristel decided to combine various superfoods and create 7 different powder mixes. Each of them is a functional powerful mix that brings different health benefits to the consumer. With only one spoon a day, you can get all essential fruits & veggies in your diet.Their Forever Beautiful Mix is, for instance, supercharged with anti-oxidants and aims to nourish your skin. While their Power Matcha Mix is a great alternative for coffee as it will boost your energy. Listen on to hear about the other superfood mixes they have for you!2) The Your Super IngredientsAt Your Super, we only meet with superfoods in powder form, which might make you wonder whether they give you the same amount of nutrients as fresh fruits and vegetables? The answer is that superfoods don\'t just give you the same amount, but actually a lot more.\xa0As superfoods are dried and shredded, which count as very minimal processing, they don\'t lose from their nutrient content. On the other hand, fresh fruits and vegetables lose nutrients as soon as they leave the ground and you also never really know whether the \'fresh\' label in the supermarket really means something.\xa0Taking it a step further, all the Your Super ingredients are strictly organic, non-GMO and come from the highest quality sources. Michael and Kristel make sure of this by actually visiting every single farm where they source their ingredients from and by running lab tests on everything they put in their mixes.\xa0Press play to hear why the Your Super founders put such a high emphasis on sourcing from the right places and why they\'d like to educate people to read the labels before buying anything in a grocery store!3) Outlook On Our Future Health TrendsAccording to Michael, it\'s not a surprise that people are becoming more and more receptive to superfoods. He sees that while in the past everything revolved around convenience, today we are simply not willing to make a choice between convenience and quality. People have become more health-conscious and "force" brands to create products that excel on both ends.\xa0As brands recognize that trends move in a healthier direction, they offer a greater variety of high-quality options. Which in turn further pushes people towards a healthier lifestyle. And Your Super is ready to stand at the forefront of these changes by sharing knowledge and educating people about the benefits of a more plant-based diet.\xa0Tune in to hear more about how Michael sees the future of our nation\'s health and in what ways Your Super will educate people to eat more plants! | Today on the 20 Minute Fitness podcast we are discussing a crucial matter for our health: hydration. Hydration is extremely important not only for fitness purposes but for basically keeping yourself alive. 60-70% of our body is made up of water and it\'s essential for maintaining a healthy functioning of your key organs, like your heart. Losing as little as 2% of your body\'s water content can lead to dehydration, which could have several negative effects on your daily life. But today we\'re here to prevent this by introducing the best innovations out there that won\'t let you ever experience dehydration. Press play to learn how tech can help you to stay on top of your hydration game!Three Things You\'ll Learn1) Cheap Hydration RemindersAs you probably could\'ve guessed, there are a number of apps out there, which are specializing in hydration. These apps can basically take the place of your personal assistant and make sure that you never forget to drink enough water.\xa0The first one is called Plant Nany, which aims to gamify hydration. As the name suggests, you get a virtual plant that you have to take care of. Every sip of water is translated into watering your plant, which will help in its growth. Besides having fun, you can also set water-intake goals, look at your historic data and work on improving over time in a systematic manner.\xa0For those who are not that interested in the gamification part, we have Daily Water (for iPhone users) and Water Drink Reminder (for Android users). These apps have the same underlying approach of trying to build your habit of drinking enough water via reminders throughout the day. They will let you set your unit and volume of choice and provide you with more detailed insights on past consumption habits.\xa0Listen on to hear more about the different features these hydration apps have!2) Smart Water BottlesTaking it a step further, there are also physical products that can help in hitting your hydration goals. On the smart water bottles\' end, we have Hydrate Spark 3. This smart bottle reminds you when to drink by lighting up and also tracks your water intake.\xa0 The bottle comes with an app that sets your personalized hydration goals every day based on your activity level, physique, and the weather. After the data is synced to the app, you can compare how well you are doing based on your targets.\xa0If you\'re one of those who don\'t like caring water bottles around, you can also get a hydration reminder attachment called Ulla. This tiny gadget can be placed on any glass or bottle that you\'re drinking from, which is a great flexibility benefit. Ulla also tracks when you\'re drinking water and sends you reminders by blinking min 1x/hour. This way you\'ll never forget to sip on a glass of water regularly. Press play to hear how Hydrate Spark 3 and Ulla will ensure that drinking enough water becomes your next healthy habit!3) The Multifunctional Water Bottle\xa0Finally, we have a gadget that\'s not just a smart water bottle, but also a nutritionist at the same time. Lifefuels is probably the most high-tech water bottle you\'ve ever seen. On one side, this smart nutrition bottle also helps you stay hydrated by tracking your beverage consumption, allowing you to set goals and giving you feedback on your hydration progress.And on the other hand, which is the wow factor of Lifefuels, it also ensures your right nutrient and vitamin consumption in a tasty way. You can insert fuel pods in the base of the bottle and with the help of the app dispense these in the liquid the bottle contains. There are various categories of fuels, such as wellness and fitness, with special flavors and benefits.Tune in to today\'s episode to discover what fuel pods you can get with your Lifefuels bottle! | This week on the 20 Minute Fitness podcast’s ‘Why I Built This’ mini-series, we bring to you Omri Yoffe, a guy behind a very interesting company in the health & fitness space, called Vi. Omri’s path is definitely not your average tech founder’s, as he is a former Israeli Air Force pilot. And today he is the mind and leader behind Vi, the ultimate next-generation running coach: an AI personal trainer, who gives you real-time feedback.\xa0Even though Vi started off with a focus on running, Omri and the team have much bigger goals for the company’s future. Listen on to find out more about Omri’s journey from the Air Force to the fit-tech space. And how he’s planning to fulfill Vi’s mission of growing the world\'s best AI companion for body & mind!Three Things You Will Learn1) The Vi ExperienceYou must be wondering how Vi looks like and what it\'s like to go for a run with her. Well, Vi is also an app, just like the rest of your health & fitness apps sitting on your smartphone. But due to Vi\'s three magic ingredients: data collection, machine learning tools, and her UX, she will take you on a more immersive, natural & audio journey.\xa0After completing the on-boarding and going on your first running "date", Vi will start learning about you and get to know you as a person. From that moment onwards, she will build up a truly personalized training plan that\'s in line with your fitness level, goals, and personality. Each session will be highly personalized, using your own name, stats, and goals with the right kind of music in the background. Press play to hear how Vi is crafting your personalized running sessions and what else she has to offer!2) How Vi Will Coach You For Your First 5kWhile Vi can be relevant for all levels, the team is most passionate about casual runners or those who have not even started running yet. So if you\'re just about to start training for your first 5k, Vi is definitely a running buddy for you!Vi will set up a weekly plan for you every week and all you have to do is press \'play\' on the app and start running. After each session, you can give her feedback, which will be taken into consideration when Vi plans your next run.And the most valuable part of all is that Vi is also there with you during each run and gives you feedback in real-time. She will pay attention to your cadence and make sure that you maintain the right step rate. She will also give you advice on how to stay in the optimal HR zone based on your personal goals. And finally, Vi will give you feedback on your pace as well.\xa0Tune in to learn how Vi is able to give you all these real-time feedback and how she will guide you to reaching your personal goals!3) The Evolution Of ViVi was officially born and taken to market in 2017 after a very successful Kickstarter campaign. However, the technology itself was built a few years back for a completely different purpose. Vi was originally built as a voice feedback technology for pilots & astronauts. A system that was created to save lives after a tragedy that happened to one of Omri\'s friends in the Airforce.\xa0But after a few years, Omri realized that it\'s not only pilots and astronauts who could make use of Vi. He thought that the "hands-free - eyes-free" experience also has great potentials in the fitness industry. And that there’s some magic in getting into this “audio zone” with the right music, coaching, and personalization. And he was right.\xa0The team started off with running, but Omri gave us a sneak peek of where we can expect to see Vi popping up in the near future. Tune in for more! | This week on the 20 Minute Fitness podcast we’re taking you out on the ocean, as we’ll cover tech that comes handy for surfers. Some might have a misconception of surfing and think of it as just a fun activity rather than a challenging sport. But as soon as you get out on the water you realize that this is not the case, and there’re a number of devices that can also prove this to you.Press play to hear about the gadgets that will become your best surfing buddies and to learn how they can guide you both before and after your sessions!Three Things You\'ll Learn1) Forecast & Rewind With These Surfing AppsIt really shouldn’t come as a surprise that there are a number of dedicated surfing apps that are available right at your fingertips. For pre-surfing help, you can, for example, download Surfline. An app that is considered as one of the world’s most trusted ones in weather forecasting.With a professional meteorologist team behind Surfline, you can get information on the conditions of hundreds of surfing spots around the world. You can access long range swell forecasts and also see what’s happening at more than 500 surf & beach camps via real-time data. This way Surfline will always ensure that you know what to expect ahead of getting out on the water.While Surfline also tracks your surfing performance, an app that specializes in this, even more, is Dawn Patrol. This app works with Apple Watch & iPhone integrations to analyze your surf and log all your sessions. Your Apple Watch & Dawn Patrol together track everything from the distance and the number of waves surfed to your HR and calories burnt.Listen on to hear more about the before and after guidance, these surfing apps can provide!2) Your Virtual Surf CoachIt’s one thing to get some feedback on your surfing performance, but taking it to the next level really comes with recommendations based on that feedback. Which is exactly what By The Wave, a company that provides virtual coaching for skate, surf, and snowboard, does. And this time around we’ll focus on their device, called Ride+ that was built for surfers.Ride+ is a tiny gadget that can be attached to your board and connected to your phone via their app. The gadgets track your rides and provide you with all the basic data measured by the previously mentioned apps as well. But what makes Ride+ unique is that the device also measures your form and can detect errors in it.When you open up the app you get a visual representation of yourself via a virtual avatar. With this virtual avatar Ride+ goes through your mistakes and shows the correct form of each movement. Tune in to hear more about how Ride+ will turn you into a pro surfer over time!3) The Surfing ExtrasBesides all the gadgets that focus on your performance and form, there are quite a few innovations that we can think of as “extras”. One of which is a really useful tool for especially those who shred the waves of more wild waters. The Sharkbanz 2 is a wrist band with a technology developed by marine biologists that “scares” sharks away. The band has a strong electromagnetic field that releases 1000x stronger sensations than anything in the shark’s normal food chain. As a result, sharks are deterred away.And if we take turns from focusing on things that benefit the individual surfer to innovations that benefit the entire planet, we can take a look at Smartfin. Smartfin is not just a technology, it’s a movement that provides its members with research-grade data collecting surfboard fins. This integrated technology then collects data that can “help fill the gap in the oceanographic data”. An innovation that can aid the research on how Earth is going to respond to global warming over time.Press play to learn more about the Smartfin’s movement and to hear about other exciting innovations in the surfing world! | This week we are lucky enough to have someone on the show, who basically pioneered one of the biggest trends in today’s health & wellness world: personalized vitamins. Craig Elbert, a double Ivy League graduate, has co-founded Care/of, the first personalized vitamin company in 2016 and has changed the way we all think about vitamins and supplements.\xa0In less than 4 years, Care/of has grown into a worldwide known brand with millions of customers. Listen on to hear about Craig’s story, why he decided to found Care/of and their overall mission that goes way beyond vitamins!Three Things You Will Learn1) Why Care/of Was BornTraditionally the thought of buying vitamins and supplements was nothing fun or pleasant. It was more of a miserable experience of walking into a store and grabbing something off the shelf with no idea whether it would work or not. This is exactly how Craig felt about vitamin shopping as well, until one day he realized that he could actually change this. Craig figured that the vitamins & supplements industry is perfect for e-commercialization and that he could apply his knowledge in user experience design to create something much better. Which is exactly what he did by building Care/of.\xa0From this week\'s episode, you can learn more about the Care/of experience and how they personalize every users\' vitamin pack. Press play now!2) How Care/of Fixes A Broken IndustryThe vitamin and supplement industry has always been quite self-regulating. Meaning that vitamins don\'t have to go through FDA approval to get on the shelves. Which, unfortunately, leads to companies cutting corners here and there and not being transparent with their customers.\xa0Care/of has decided to take a different approach. Their local supply chain team have decades of experience and connections all over the world. They source their ingredients globally, aiming for nothing but the best quality. These ingredients are then shipped to their US manufacturing plants, where they go through several rounds of testing, which is crucial in the process.\xa0Listen to the interview with Craig to learn more about Care/of\'s vitamin "menu" and where they source their ingredients from!3) The Evolution Of Care/ofCraig and his Co-Founder started Care/of as a simple online vitamin company, but it quickly turned out that it will grow into something much bigger. The Care/of team knows that vitamins and supplements are just a piece of the healthy living puzzle. And as they\'re putting the customer at the heart of the company, they decided to provide support on other fronts as well.\xa0Besides selling their products and educating their customers about vitamins and supplements, Care/of also creates content around other aspects of health & wellness. Their ultimate goal is to build an ecosystem where their consumers can get continuous preventive health guidance. Including topics around nutrition, fitness and the science of habit building.\xa0Tune in to hear all about the Care/of initiatives and how they are planning to perfect their services in the future! | Today on the 20 Minute Fitness podcast we bring you the popular mini-series special, our favorite health & fitness apps of the month.

Because why would you want to get stuck in a gym, when you can exercise in the fresh air as well?Listen on to find out which are the outdoors physical activities that are not just efficient, but also fun and which apps you should download for them!What You Will Learn1) Our Favorite Hiking Apps - Gaia GPS App & Maps 3D ProThe best form of physical activity that takes full advantage of the weather and the beautiful nature is hiking.

Gaia GPS App has an over 1 million people community and a great database of hikes. For each trail, you can check its length, difficulty level and how long it takes to complete it before you get on the road. The Gaia GPS app uses intelligent routing tools, and tracks your distance, altitude climbed and elevation change.Just like Gaia GPS, Maps 3D Pro will also allow you to download maps and use them offline and track a bunch of metrics during your hike. But what\'s really special about Maps 3D Pro is its 3D visualization feature of the trails. So if you\'re struggling with topography, you can ask Maps 3D Pro for help! Listen to this week\'s episode to find out which of the hiking apps is the one for you!2) Our Favorite Mountain Biking App - Trailforks AppIf you want to opt for something of a bit more an extreme sport, try mountain biking. With Trailforks you can discover more than 130,000 trails in 95+ countries that you can ride through with your bike.The app acts similarly to a crowdfunding campaign, as every user can submit new trails to the library. Similarly to the hiking apps, Trailforks also has an offline map feature and gives you a bunch of info about each route. These include route popularity, elevation profiles, topography and points of interest.\xa0And if you don\'t want to ride alone, you can use the heatmap feature to discover where you might find some other bikers. Based on the heatmap, you\'ll also be able to discover the most popular trails in your area. So, are you ready to hop on your bike?3) Our Favorite Rockclimbing App - Mountain ProjectTo up your extreme sports game, you can also go for an exciting rock-climbing trip.

Here you can find additional climbing information, such as blogs and forums, which can come handy for both beginners and pros.\xa0Press play to learn more about why Mountain Project should be your ultimate rock-climbing buddy! | This week\'s episode is all about strength training & weight lifting, as we have the pleasure to introduce you to the editor & Co-Founder of BarBend, David Tao. David is a veteran in the health & fitness industry, with nearly a decade of experience building editorial teams in the space.Press play to hear all about David\'s story and how he built BarBend, the gold mine of strength training!Three Things You Will Learn1) The BarBend EcosystemThere are a lot of great blogs out there. There are also some awesome YouTubers and inspiring social media channels. But when a brand can do it all, that\'s the real deal.\xa0BarBend grew from a tiny blog into a whole ecosystem of a blog, YouTube channel, social media and soon a podcast. As, according to David, they are trying to build "multimedia packages" from every piece of content rather than just focusing on a standalone format.\xa0Content-wise, BarBend is centered around strength training. They cover everything from events to expert opinions, training plans and nutrition guides. And recently they have also started to work with brands that they personally use and support, as well as to review products in the industry.\xa0Listen to this week\'s episode to hear what sort of advice you can get if you visit one of the BarBend channels and who their main target audience is!2) Why Is BarBend Different Than OthersThe core philosophy of BarBend is creating credible content that has not been created before and making it accessible to all. To ensure the content\'s credibility, David has collected an amazing network of experts, including coaches and PhDs, who are all working hard to ensure the high quality.\xa0Referencing research papers and getting experts to verify articles however if only one side of the story. On the other end, David says that making a piece of content as enjoyable and easily consumable as they can is another key factor they strive for. And so creating something more engaging, like a video or an infographic, that goes with a given article is a must and is also something that makes BarBend stand out.\xa0Finally, we all know that every story has several sides, which doesn\'t necessarily mean that someone is wrong and someone is right. This is how the guys at BarBend think as well. So they aim to give a full picture to their readers, introduce several opinions and contextualize them.Press play to learn more about why BarBend\'s unique and who stand behind the great content they publish day by day!\xa03) How BarBend Was BornDavid got into both weight lifting and the editorial world even before leaving college.\xa0 After a significant injury and an unsuccessful recovery process, he started training with the weightlifter community in Boston - as weight lifting was known for focusing on mobility. This is where he got one of his passions.\xa0And his other passion, creating content, was born when he started working for Greatist, a well-known online health & fitness magazine. After leaving Greatist he continued to follow his two passions and jumped onto the road of freelancing mainly in the fitness world. And this road of freelancing is what took him to meet his Co-Founders today.\xa0As someone who has been into sports and worked on great content all his life, his disappointment about not being able to find the right quality content around strength training has been building up for a while. So after meeting his Co-Founders in 2015, David presented them with the idea of BarBend and started building it straight away.Tune in for some more on the founding story and to hear how the name, BarBend was really born! | As we all know, "abs are made in the kitchen", meaning that if you want to see results, you\'ll always have to pay attention to what you eat. But what if all the tracking and counting drives you crazy? You\'re definitely not alone, and this is when you should turn to mindfulness.So if you want to make mindful eating a habit for a beneficial long-term change, press play to learn about the resources you should use!\xa0Three Things You Will Learn1) How To Build Up Your Mindful Eating Knowledge BaseBefore jumping straight on to the mindful eating wagon, you should build a thorough understanding of what mindful eating really is. And to do this, what better resources could we recommend than some other fantastic podcasts out there?The first addition to your library should be the Brain over Binge podcast by Kathryn Hansen. And the episode you should aim for is #42 The power of mindfulness in binge eating. In this episode, Kathryn interviews someone who used to struggle with binge eating for a long time and managed to finally overcome it with the help of mindfulness.\xa0The next one on your playlist should be the Technology for Mindfulness podcast that introduces a range of topics where mindfulness can help you. The host doesn\'t just "explore the intersection between mindfulness and technology", but also interviews experts in the field of mindfulness, who all share their tips & tricks.\xa0Finally, to learn more about various cues that can signal hunger and fullness, you should press play on the Just Eat It podcast! In every episode, the host, Laura Thomas, will help you build a more meaningful relationship with food and teach how to stay on top of your intuitive eating game.\xa02) Guided Through Mindful EatingOnce you feel like you get it all, you can actually move on to practicing mindful eating. While some might argue that technology takes away the whole point of mindfulness, at the first stages of your practice, it won\'t hurt to use some mindfulness apps for guidance.Smiling Mind is one of the most popular ones, with a massive database of mindfulness programs designed to deal with challenges in all fields of your life. After creating a profile, go in the "Find 10 minutes for your mind" category and look for the mindful eating session. This will help you take the first steps on your mindful eating journey!If you\'re looking for something longer-lasting, you can turn to the famous Headspace app. Headspace has a 30-day long mindful eating course that will explain to you why we eat the way we do and what drives our different choices when it comes to food. During this course, you\'ll also learn various techniques, such as "body scan" & "noting", which will be helpful in the mindfulness journey ahead of you.Listen to this week\'s episode to find out more about the mindfulness apps, their features and decide which one will suit your needs the most!3) How To Hack Mindful EatingFor those who feel like actively practicing mindfulness is not their thing, there\'s another way around incorporating mindful eating into your routine.

Press play and learn how you\'ll be able to use these insights in becoming more mindful in your everyday life! | Today on the 20 Minute Fitness we dig deep into a topic that has not entered the mainstream markets yet but is extremely important: gut health. And to get real professional insight on the topic, we talk to Richard Lin, the founder of Thryve, a personalized probiotics company targeted for your gut health.\xa0Listen to learn more about gut health, why it\'s important and how Thryve will get you the personalized probiotics your gut calls for to live a happy & healthy life!Three Things You Will Learn1) Why Thryve Is Better Than Your Average ProbioticsYou can easily walk in any major supermarket and get a bottle of basic probiotics. But to be fair, you might not be doing any good to your health & body with that. As 1) you don\'t actually know what you\'re getting & 2) it might have completely different strains than what your body needs.In contrast to this, Thryve works at a completely personalized basis. The first step with Thryve is to do an at-home microbiome test, which is then sent to a lab for analysis. Once you receive your lab test results, you\'ll know all the ins and outs of your gut and what bacteria live in your body.\xa0Based on these, Thryve will give you an overview of the various symptoms that you’re likely to have. Additionally, they\'ll also provide you with food recommendations and truly personalized probiotics. Tune in to hear more about how Thryve\'s gut health testing works and the benefits your body will gain from personalized probiotics!\xa02) Microbiome A-ZMicrobiome testing is unfortunately not that common yet, but it can really go a long way. There are a lot of chronic diseases as well as digestive issues that you can get to the bottom of with a simple microbiome test. While you might think, "I know how to eat healthily, I just have to avoid processed foods & eat more veggies", which is indeed a great generic advice, one size doesn\'t fit all. Meaning that your microbiome might call for completely different veggies than your best friends\'.\xa0Personalizing your diet and complementing it with the right probiotics can have tremendous benefits for your gut health & overall wellbeing. The variety of bacterial species found in your gut will increase, just like the good bacteria. While the unpleasant bacteria that live in your body will decrease. This will ultimately result in improvements in digestive & metabolic issues.\xa0Press play to learn more about the microbiome and why microbiome testing can be beneficial for you!3) How Thryve Was BornYou might think that Richard has some sort of medical background, which is why he founded a gut health & personalized probiotics company. But this is not the case. In reality, Richard has a completely different background, however, he went through a very serious disease, which made him realize how important his gut health was.A couple of years back, Richard was misdiagnosed, put on some antibiotics and got a superbug in his stomach. Even though he could feel that something was wrong, all the doctors that he saw told him that he was perfectly healthy.So he went on to the road of self-diagnosis and looked for answers at online forums. Finally, he found out that he has a very serious chronic illness which kills about half a million citizens a year in the US alone. After being successfully treated and getting better, Richard came to the conclusion that consumers don’t have a good tool to understand what’s happening in their microbiome. Which he wanted to change.Listen on to hear all about Richard\'s dramatic journey and how he used one of his competitors to gain inspiration for Thryve!\xa0', 'chan_desc': '20 Minute Fitness hosted by Shape', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/fc/a0/10/fca0104b-efb1-f31d-64f7-a77cea190938/mza_2866077480652897150.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2017-10-31'}}

Crossfit is perhaps the ultimate sport with concurrent demands (although interestingly high level Crossfit athletes don\'t necessarily train concurrently). The Crossfit training practiced in most gyms is concurrent in nature, with any given workout incorporating a mix of weightlifting, conditioning (HIIT and longer-term cardiovascular work), gymnastics, and other elements. \xa0 Conjugate training on the other hand involves training one specific skills or attribute at a time, with the aim of tying each individual attribute together for a performance event at the end of a block of training. Interestingly, the word conjugate comes from the Latin words con-, a prefix meaning with, and iugum, a noun meaning yoke or chain; in other words, to chain together. Block training is a form of conjugate training in which a lifter begins with high volume, high rep programming, possibly with accessory lifts and conditioning, and transitions through phases which gradually taper the work toward the specific demands of the strength meet -- single rep max attempts performed entirely in the anaerobic ATP energy system. \xa0 The Soviet coaches recognized that exposing children to a wide variety of sports and physical activities -- soccer, gymnastics, swimming, etc -- developed broad, general athletic skills which translated well to other sports and activities as the children aged and became more focused and specialized. Training these various skills at the same time, or concurrently, was an important aspect of the early development of any athlete in the Soviet system. For the Russians, only at more advanced stages of training should an athlete hone in very specifically on a single sport, training singular skills on at a time in a conjugate method. \xa0 Have a question about training?

Andy is a master strength coach and full of insight into programming theory as well as practical solutions to the issues lifters face in their day-to-day training. \xa0 In this episode, Andy debunks the idea of a "perfect program," and outlines practical ways to set yourself up for success on any program you try. He also discusses the importance of intensity in post-novice programming specifically, and why the weight on the bar is still a key driver of strength gains even after the lifter starts cycling volume and intensity in the intermediate phases of training. \xa0 Have a question about training?

After observing that the lifter\'s barspeed was quite fast during multiple consecutive intensity day lifts, Scott took it as a sign that the volume day work was sufficiently driving progress and decided to hold the weight on the bar steady for future volume day workouts. Interestingly, the lifter has continued to hit intensity day PR\'s for several weeks without increasing the weight of the volume work. \xa0 RIP Glenn Pendlay, who passed away on September 5, 2019. Glenn left behind many contributions to the strength world -- he introduced a style of barbell row now known as the Pendlay Row, had a hand in the creation of the Texas Method, and coached many Olympic weightlifters.\xa0 \xa0 Have a question about training?

Is the way you think about your habits, your every day habits that create the level of health which you currently have, aging you or slowing the process? Mindful practice of your inner and outer conversations may have more influence on your aging process than anything else that you do.\xa0 Of course you’ll have to have the right habits. Yet, if you’re mindful of them, you’ll naturally be inclined to make positive changes. You’ll seek the right information and the right steps. Then you’ll be conscious applying them in your life.\xa0 Dr. Ellen Langer, Ph.D., is a social psychologist and the first female professor to gain tenure in the Psychology Department at Harvard University. She is the author of eleven books and more than two hundred research articles written for general and academic readers on mindfulness for over 35 years. Her best selling books include\xa0Mindfulness; The Power of Mindful Learning;\xa0On Becoming an Artist: Reinventing Yourself Through Mindful Creativity; and\xa0Counterclockwise: Mindful Health and the Power of Possibility. Her most recent book is\xa0The Art of Noticing\xa0which pairs one-liners culled from her research with her original paintings. Dr. Langer has been described as the “mother of mindfulness” and the mother of positive psychology. Among other honors, she is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and three Distinguished Scientist Awards, the World Congress Award, the\xa0NYU\xa0Alumni Achievement Award, and the Staats award for Unifying Psychology. Most recently she received the Liberty Science Genius Award.\xa0 The citation for the\xa0APA\xa0distinguished contributions award reads, in part, “…her pioneering work revealed the profound effects of increasing mindful behavior…and offers new hope to millions whose problems were previously seen as unalterable and inevitable. Ellen Langer has demonstrated repeatedly how our limits are of our own making.” This episode was peppered with questions: You started pioneering this mindfulness movement – certainly about aging – before anyone else seemed to be writing much about it. In 1979, the rest of the world wasn’t quite tuned into the shock that was going to happen when baby boomers all started turning 50 and the change it would have on business opportunity, the economy, health care, so what was it that made you do that study so early in your career? Was it personal? Was there some influence of other researchers that pivoted you in that direction? In 1979 how old were you? And now you are? \xa0 Tell listeners about the Clockwise study When you removed them from that environment what happened? This is a quote from some of the press reporting on the Clockwise study: “What she found, however,\xa0surprised even her own team of researchers. Before and after the experiment, both groups of men took a battery of cognitive and physical tests, and after just one week, there were dramatic positive changes across the board. Both groups were stronger and more flexible. Height, weight, gait, posture, hearing, vision—even their performance on intelligence tests had improved. Their joints were more flexible, their shoulders wider, their fingers not only more agile, but longer and less gnarled by arthritis. But the men who had acted as if they were actually back in 1959 showed significantly more improvement. Those who had impersonated younger men seemed to have bodies that actually\xa0were\xa0younger.” [as printed in Harvardmagazine.com]\xa0\xa0 Because your body is listening you can change anything. -Dr. Ellen Langer Why didn’t we… the mainstream rest of the world hear more about this earlier?\xa0 The counterclockwise study results have been described in several of your books, but have never appeared in a professional journal.\xa0 Why was that? The Impact of Mindful and Mindless Revealed Almost 4 decades after that study… you’ve been quoted and your research cited many times in regard to placebo, the power of thinking. We’re now using and hearing the word mindset so much more often. Do you think we’re getting it? The majority of us? Or is it mindset that still limits us? “It is not our physical state that limits us,” she explains—it is our mindset about our own limits, our perceptions, that draws the lines in the sand.” Why is it so hard – or is it that we’re doing it wrong – to change mindset? How can listeners put mindfulness to work for them? But the biggest obstacle for so many is the language and thoughts that reflect their expectations. The entire premise of Flipping 50 is to first change our mindset so that our expectations send us looking for new knowledge and science that will help us live out our much higher expectations. Exercising less, with the eye on balancing hormones naturally for more longevity and vitality, optimizing weight with more but better food not diets, and moving for joy not punishment.\xa0 “Wherever you put the mind, the body will follow” But if the expectation is currently exercise is hard and it’s only purpose to burn off something that shouldn’t be there or change something unacceptable… or that it must take dietary deprivation and restriction … then getting healthy becomes hard. Do you live with any care about your age? Hotel Maids Mindful Change The other study I love to refer to is that you did with Alia Crum with 84 hotel workers. Talk about placebo effect. The mindset we adopt when we take pills – or not – that matters. You divided the maids into two groups and nothing changed about their physical habits at work, only the belief about their physical activity while at work changed. The study was 4 weeks – is that correct? Engagement is powerful, it’s the act of noticing. Much of what you’re saying is about the ability to accept that there is a different way to think about anything. If I gave you some thoughts from our listeners – limiting beliefs – would you be willing to counter with something that might help them see the obstacles those mindless thoughts provide … and offer an action or thought change that would remove self-inflicted limits? Many of the women listening are thinking:  I’ve always been overweight. I’ve had insomnia forever. I always get injured just when I get some momentum exercising.

And for good reason! Muscle mass not only contributes to your metabolism but it determines your successful independent living later in life. When I began presenting on stages internationally in the 90’s I often said sexy now is one thing but later it’s going to be who can carry their own tray in the dining room. Truth. Today’s episode is in part about some of the research making waves and about contents of the Flipping 50 Member box too good not to share. In the Flipping 50 Member box recently we’ve added super strength bands- also known as blood flow restriction bands used in a special Kaatsu training method. As always the Flipping 50 Member Box is filled with items vetted and used by me and I also love to introduce you to the creators and people behind the company. That’s what today is all about. In the show notes I’ll be linking to the products –F50MB subscribers have a special market place access to find at a better rate – and I’ll also link to a recent blog all about the technique complete with videos. The method is going to be an extra bonus for STRONGER I participants this last quarter of 2019. My Guest My guest is creator of BFR bands that went into our Flipping 50 Member box this month.\xa0 As a personal trainer,\xa0Kusha\xa0Karvandi has trained over 10,000 hours of one-on-one sessions. With over 20 nationally-recognized certifications, and a unique specialty in neuroscience,\xa0Kusha\'s ability to transform his clients is unlike any other coach in the fitness industry. Although considered the eternal student,\xa0Kusha\xa0describes his coaching philosophy by the latin word "docere" which implies \'coach as teacher.\'\xa0Kusha\xa0is the creator of the BFR Bands, designed for the research-backed form of training known as blood flow restriction training, which helps you gain muscle tone and strength without lifting heavy weight. Questions We Answer in This Episode:  So, if a woman is able to lift heavy and willing to, research seems to prefer results from heavy to results from blood flow restriction bandsalthough there\'s promise in the gains from BFR (compared to not using them with light loads), do you concur? What if any research is there about bone density benefits? That said, there\'s a lot of great opportunity for strength after 50 in using BFR including less recovery time, an easy travel alternative, or during bedrest/other injury or life getting in the way of the "gym" an easy way to prevent muscle loss - do you have some customer stories to share?\xa0 Let\'s talk about protocol for listeners that varies from the traditional 2-3 times a week strength training protocol? What\'s the ideal frequency? \xa0   And in terms of sets and repetitions, let\'s talk about that for listeners seeking strength after 50 because that too is unique...\xa0   Let\'s talk about the elephant in the room... the bands look like some big muscle head in the deep dark of the weight room would use them. In fact, when you go shopping online it\'s pretty apparent that they are intended for body builders, or figure competitors, there\'s not a menopausal female in any of the ads I saw for over 2 dozen different products, are you trying to change that? Why and how?\xa0 So, truth there is some research on older adults, both resistance training, aerobic exercising, and even at rest or bedrest ... what areas show promise for this tool with regard to age?\xa0 Should my listeners be using it? or should they be using it for their parents seeking strength after 50!? Last, we\'re super excited about the lower body bands our Flipping 50 member box subscribers are getting gifted! Do you also have upper body bands? We don\'t want to skip that!\xa0  Links to the BFR bands: https://checkout.bfrshop.com/double-wrap-bfr-bands https://checkout.bfrshop.com/prox-bands/ (Flipping 50 Member Box subscribers: Use your special Market Place to get yours at the better rate on additional sets) Links to resources mentioned: Osteosarcopenia podcast\xa0 Flipping 50 Member Box \xa0 STRONGER I\xa0 Should You Be Doing Blood Flow Restriction Exercise\xa0\xa0  I’d love to hear from you on this one.

This condition that refers to bone and muscle losses is relatively new. There is a lack of consensus among researchers on what to call it (sarco-osteopenia, sarco-osteoporosis, osteosarcopenia). No matter what they name it, for you and I this is a topic we need to unpack.\xa0 Before we dive into this week’s episode … a shout out to listener mlg114 who left this comment in iTunes: “You and Figs might have saved my marriage. My husband and I have been in the “me exercise you not” pattern for a few years! We’ve been hurting each other unintentionally on this very subject! Result has been severe resentment though we’re about to celebrate 25 years married! You have spread your mission of kindness to us successfully! Thank you with all my heart for this valuable, intelligent podcast!” So thank you to mlg114 this made my day and I shared it with Figs, too.I’d love it if you’d leave a rating in iTunes too. I have been reading these regularly and want to start sharing them with you. I’ll link to iTunes in today’s show notes at flippingfifty.com/osteosarcopenia and to the episode about how to encourage healthy habits without nagging.\xa0 So let’s get into it. I’ve got a lot to cover here. You’ll notice this episode is potentially longer than most. It’s a big topic. There’s a lot of controversy at first glance and that’s resulting in a lot of confusion. I want to clear it all up for you. Osteosarcopenia is the new term given to the combination of osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia. I’ve got to cover some vocabulary first. Osteoporosis\xa0is the low bone mineral density (BMD) that is statistically 2.5 standard deviations from the ideal of a young woman. Meaning, it’s significantly lower than ideal bone density. Osteopenia\xa0is the space between that ideal bone mineral density and 2.5 standard deviations from ideal. You’re not good any longer, you’re not quite bad enough to diagnose as having osteoporosis. But it’s not going in the right direction. Sarcopenia\xa0is pronounced muscle and strength loss. It can be in spite of normal weight or obesity – that when coupled is termed “sarcobesity.” It’s characterized by low grip strength, a poor chair stand test (say you can’t do more than 5 rises from a chair in 15 seconds), low muscle measured by a DXA scan, and low performance of a battery of tests like an up and go test\xa0and a timed 400 meter walk, to name a couple.\xa0 The combination of both low bone density and low muscle mass is what I’m referring to today as osteosarcopenia. This Episode Non-pharmacological strategies to help prevent, reverse, or treat (by way of exercise and lifestyle habits) to improve both conditions independently and the combined condition osteosarcopenia are the topic for this episode.\xa0 Spoiler alert.\xa0This episode is aptly sponsored by STRONGER I, my 12-week strength training program designed for women in perimenopause, menopause, and beyond. It’s based 100% on research featuring women in that group. Such a small percent of programs are made for women, based on research featuring women, that most everything you’ve learned about exercise may be a lie. If it wasn’t about who you were or are at the time you did it, then it wasn’t considering the unique hormones, metabolism, body composition or unique socialization that you as a woman have. I don’t think for a minute any 60-year-old overweight man would have begun an exercise program based on what worked for 22-year-old female collegiate athletes. Do you? And yet, the equivalent is essentially what’s been going on for decades in fitness for women. STRONGER I opens four times a year. As I record this my team just let me know it’s open! That means there’s a juicy early bird rate right now. You can learn more about it at flippingfifty.com/getstronger [I’ll share that link in the show notes] If you’re listening to this later – which I know happens – and you’re curious you can get on a notification list to learn when it does open again and have first chance to save a spot if you decide you want it.\xa0 Stopping Bone Losses Let me start with osteoporosis. For women in post menopause concern about bone density usually heightens. For good reason, once we lose the protective factor that estrogen offers, we lose bone faster – in fact it really accelerates right after menopause.\xa0 Currently losses of .6%, 1.1% and 2.1% per year for the 60-69, 70-79 and over 80 age groups is the level of average bone loss.\xa0 In the first 4-5 years post menopause loss is accelerated to 1.5% per year for spine and 1.1-1.4% for hip. I want to stop the red flags and alarms going off in your head right now. I want to remind you: that these statistics are looking at a lot of women who Do Not exercise. They may smoke, drink more than a glass of wine a day, eat poorly and never lift weights. This is like “normal range” in labs. It’s COMMON, it may not be you. And no matter what, bone losses are preventable, and to some extent reversible, or there are ways to prevent falls and fractures so bone losses are not devastating. So if your thoughts are spiraling downward, stop.\xa0 Stopping Muscle Losses Truthfully, stopping muscle loss is easier or at least has less specific “rules.” To provide adequate stimulus to muscle for lean muscle maintenance or increases, you must reach fatigue. That can be done with heavy load and few repetitions or with a lighter load and more repetitions. Fatigue, or temporary fatigue, is simply getting to the last repetition that you can do with good form or complete. Within minutes, or actually seconds, you recover and are able to do more if you had to. But without that actual muscle fatigue stimulus of overload for women in perimenopause and beyondcountless studies are coming back saying the positive influences on muscle, strength, fat burning, and metabolism is minimal.\xa0 I Exercise, Is that Enough? At this point I hope you understand there’s some criteria you have to meet for either bone and or muscle benefit. The effect of exercise on bone loss is controversial. At best, however, every professional not quoting research and testing effects of bone density tends to have anopinion, based on general research collectively done for populations, young and old, men and women. If you are in our Flipping 50 tribe, what I’m about to share is specifically filtered for YOU. All too often a woman may be told to “exercise” or to “walk” by her physician. She may be told to lift weights but that it doesn’t have to be heavy. I provide research here to explain why that information is or is not on target depending on who you are, what your activity history is. There is a continuum of exercise with minimal and with optimal benefits. There’s a continuum of sedentary and deconditioned women on one end and athletic women on the other end. Consideration of both continuums has to be examined to arrive at the best option for you.\xa0 Exercise for Osteosarcopenia\xa0 For osteopenia and osteoporosis aerobic and low impact exercise fails to benefit Bone Mineral Density(BMD) in most studies. In a few studies walking limits progressive bone loss. Note that is limits losses, not stops bone losses or increases bone density. Typical aerobic activity like elliptical trainers, bicycles, rowing machines have little to no positive influence on bone density. There’s a complete lack of heel strike or what’s referred to as Minimal Effective Stress (M.E.S.).\xa0 Though there may be some resistance benefit at higher settings as opposed to use of speed for intensity.\xa0 Swimming potentially has a negative effect. It completely removes the effect of gravity.\xa0 With co-existing factors many women have in addition to osteoporosis or sarcopenia, like arthritis, prior joint issues, or lack of cartilage, many older adults naturally (and should) choose water exercise. Choice of swimming for cardio exercise increases the need for resistance training. Surf and turf is a must. M.E.S. is not even met in repetitive low impact exercise like walking or jogging beyond a certain point of adaptation. Once you’re ambulatory and moving around your body has gained all the benefits it’s going to from that position and stress. More steps do not equate to more stress that the bone will positively respond to. Jumping rope or other plyometric exercise is most associated with building bone density though it may not be wise in many cases where there is already a low BMD. Strength is the clear winner for bother bone density and for muscle maintenance. If You’re Out of Shape vs. Fit For untrained individuals aerobic activity that is weight bearing in nature, like walking or Zumba, may increase BMD while in already trained individuals who have already attained a baseline of osteogenic activity (bone reformation to avoid getting too technical) these activities neither stimulate more bone density or prevent further losses.\xa0 In other words, once you’ve achieved a minimal level of bone density from an activity, you don’t get more bone benefit from the same level of stimulation. More steps, more miles, more minutes don’t equate to more benefit. Summarizing A Few Exercise Considerations: Walking: The load above gravity is less effective in osteoporosis prevention. Swimming: In some cases subjects whose primary mode of exercise is swimming show a 10% greater occurrence of low bone mineral density than those who do land based exercise. Other studies show some minimal support for bone mineral density from swimming and water exercise. This goes back to… are you a beginner who’s been doing very little? Or already active? Rebounding: This activity misses the heel strike though there is some muscular force that can increase BMD in those with LBM mass upon initial use. This aerobic activity may be safe for those with high risk of fracture, provided they have good balance (required not necessarily gained from the activity). Can you do more? Can you walk? Can you dance or box with more ground mechanical forces? Rebounding may make sense. For someone who can’t do higher impact exercise, but higher impact will provide greater benefits for those who are able. Do you remember Lance Armstrong? It’s rare for a young male, let alone an elite athlete to be diagnosed with osteoporosis. At one point one of the fittest men on earth, from hundreds of hours cycling in an unloaded environment (even with the resistance of uphill climbs) was diagnosed with low bone mineral density. This was before the interference of chemotherapy. There’s got to be a mechanical stress that is more than usual your stimulation. Once achieved more of the same mechanical stress does not improve bone. A long distance runner for instance, cannot outrun the need for strength training. In fact, because most endurance athletes tend to be lean or smaller in frame, they are likely candidates for low bone density. They’re even more at risk if they have a diet low in absorbable calcium, protein, and otherwise high in nutrient density and also don’t lift weights. Walking and Running Examples If you walk 3 miles three times a week and then become a runner you may experience a slight bump in bone density. You leave the ground with running and there’s a greater force to the bones. After that initial change, your bone density won’t further increase. Running 3 miles 3 days a week then increasing to 3 miles 6 days a week would not make you less likely to lose bone mass. In fact, if you did become leaner, you may accelerate your likelihood of low bone mass. Regular endurance exercise (without strength training) can over time accelerate muscle breakdown called catabolism. The combined loss of muscle and bone loss make a runner just as likely for osteosarcopenia as anyone. Don’t Throw Out Your Cardio Completely However controversial, there is some proof that aerobic activity can begin a process of stimulating some enzyme activity within the bone that then makes resistance training more effective. For that to happen the exercise can occur concurrently on same days or on alternate days. Resistance Exercise for Osteopsarcopenia The research on aerobic exercise is a little controversial at least before you look at the populations studied. There is no controversy\xa0about resistance training’s effects on bone mineral density. There is some confusion however about what qualifies as adequate bone mineral density and I’ll get to that next. Almost all studies point to resistance training – provided it is done with adequate intensity– as providing a protective factor for bone.\xa0 What qualifies as resistance training? There’s a continuum here too.\xa0 Yoga trainings for registered instructors list bone density as a benefit. I came unglued the day my instructor told the class that in my own 200-hour Yoga Instructor Training. There\xa0is\xa0evidence yoga helps, again on a continuum. For someone who has been previously sedentary and deconditioned, there will be bone density benefits from yoga. From couch to mat, I can’t argue that. But we’ve got to keep very clear on the fact that this doesn’t eliminate the need for a progressive resistance training plan. For someone who has been lifting weights regularly or even doing higher impact aerobic activity, there will not be “more” bone benefits from yoga, even “power” yoga. Resistance exercise for sedentary, weak, or most frail individuals might include water exercise (with adequate intensity), bicycling (again- in high gear simulating uphill climbs) though the benefits will be site specific. That is, if you’re pedaling a bike you’re going to gain the most bone density and muscle benefits in the upper leg and hip. With swimming your gains will be in the arms, upper back, and shoulders, somewhat dependent on your stroke. Starting and Progressing You can experience initial bone density benefits from yoga, bands and tubing, pilates reformers, and work your way into free weights and, ultimately, if you have known low bone density, use machine weights. Machine weights make lifting as heavily as you can, safe. I’m a firm believer that every retirement center, assisted living community should provide at the least a leg press, a chest press, and a seat row machine to help load the hip, spine and wrist.\xa0 The recommendations for resistance training for bone density specifically include:  Reaching fatigue at a weight you can lift for 10 or fewer repetitions Reaching fatigue at a slightly lower weight using power (adding force during the lift)  Not every resistance protocol that supports muscle – (which can prevent sarcopenia) – will help bones and prevent or treat osteoporosis. For muscle-specific benefits you need to reach fatigue and it can be done with lighter weights for more repetitions. That, similar to reasons more running doesn’t result in more bone density, will not be enough stimulus for the bone. Nutrition for Osteosarcopenia Low protein is directly correlated with both bone loss and muscle atrophy. High protein is associated with less muscle loss at a given age and better lower limb performance. Protein supplementation over 3-24 months corrected sarcopenia. The intervention provided 6-30 gram servings/day combined with resistance training.\xa0 Where older adults need to lose weight, resistance training plus protein intake prevent muscle loss related to calorie restriction. Bone density is also associated with higher protein intake. Further, hip fractures decreased by 16% in subjects who had high protein intake compared to those with low protein intake. Lifestyle Choices Decreasing alcohol intake and managing daily supplements like Calcium(when dietary calcium intake or absorption is less than optimal), Vitamin D, and magnesium may also support bone health. Overall nutrition adequacy is more important than it’s ever been considered before. In an upcoming podcast I’ll discuss the role of stress and happiness, as they’re associated with bone density. It’s simple. Strength training is key to aging well, independently, and to metabolism. Strength training targets bone density and lean muscleboth in a way that aerobic activity does not. That’s not to discount aerobic exercise. It’s important, though in much smaller doses than you’ve ever believed before. The Bottomline on Osteosarcopenia “Those with osteosarcopenia have worse prognosis than adults with either osteopenia or sarcopenia alone. Therapeutic strategies that have a dual effect on bone and muscle are critical in the management of osteosarcopenia.”Those therapeutic strategies include:  Adequate protein (6 x 30 gm/day) and calcium intake (1000 day – supplement with 500-600 mg calcium if not consumed though diet) Maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels (testing regularlyto adjust accordingly) Regular muscle and bone strengthening exercises (resistance training above all other exercise)  I leave you with this last comment. If you’re not strength training now, start. If you influence and love young women encourage them to get into strength training early in life to prevent bone losses that begin at age 30 otherwise. If you influence pre-teens or teens encourage participation in sports with higher impact like basketball, soccer, gymnastics, and martial arts. Swimming and biking are wonderful activities but have little influence on bone mineral deposits. Balance them with other activities.

I’ve said it before here at Flipping 50. But you already know because there are days you don’t feel like exercising, or you feel like the mirror isn’t reflecting the consistent hard work you’ve done. And it feels relative to hormone changes. Whether you knew you were in perimenopause or not– that period of time lasting up to 10 years for some women, you realize that other things were changing too.\xa0 Your skin seemed to be thinning, maybe showing more signs of wrinkles or more cellulite than you had before. You may deal with both breakouts and fine lines during this time. You notice more hair loss in the shower. So is the answer hormone replacement? What if you are and you’re still not feeling 100%? It doesn’t do all the heavy lifting, or shouldn’t. And you’ve got a lot more control than we ever might have known. The foods you eat, or don’t, the sleep habits you have, or don’t, the way you handle stress or don’t, and exercise type and timing play a factor.

And it’s less complicated than you think. So this episode is about really unraveling the hormones we’ve got changing most, what they do or did, and don’t without help as they decrease…and how exercise can help. First let’s look at the role of sex hormones in the body. Then we’ll look at how exercise influences hormones. ESTROGEN 1.Grows the lining in the uterus so that the fertilized egg can implant. 2.Increases collagen production in the entire body, most notably in the blood vessels, skin, vagina and bladder. 3.Maintains cardiovascular elasticity and blood flow. 4.Prevents the body from losing bone densityby inhibiting osteoclasts. 5.Increases vaginal lubrication and sex drive. 6.Augments sexual desire. 7.Fuels fat metabolism. 8.Facilitates mental health by increasing serotonin and dopamine in the brain. 9.Stimulates the production of progesterone, testosterone,\xa0thyroid, and more estrogen receptors. 10.Modulates adrenaline levels. 11.Is anti-inflammatory. 12.Modulates immune functions. 13.Increases melatonin levels. PROGESTERONE 1.At its peak, stimulates apoptosis (cell death/anti-cancer). 2.Increases bone density. 3.Reduces anxiety. 4.Lowers blood pressure. 5.Reduces cramping. 6.Acts as a natural diuretic. 7.Improves insulin sensitivity. 8.Increases GABA secretion. 9.Is a precursor to cortisol, and all the steroid hormones. 10.Modulates immune functions. \xa0 TESTOSTERONE 1.Plays a role in healthy heart and blood. 2.Supports a body to makeless fat, more muscle. 3.Builds bone. 4.Improves verbal memory, spatial abilities and mathematical reasoning. 5.Improves libido& erectile function. 6.Improved mood. With hormone decline, physical health may deteriorate, mental wellness decreases, and chronic diseases may creep in. At least this is what you’ve been taught and the correlation that has been true until now. Until this time when more of us have been exercising for decades or are starting now. This is important: understand that the science that’s collected data up until now is looking at the past. It is not looking at your future.\xa0 What if you chose not to believe it?\xa0 During the recession, about 14 years ago I heard a speaker get up and talk about just how much we were hearing how bad the economy was at the time. She began with, “what if we decided not to participate?” I challenge you to think the same. What if you decided not to participate in what you were told is coming with menopause and with aging? What if you rejected it? Instead, what if you went on believing you could enjoy an even more vibrant life now because of your life experience and wisdom and personal insight into what makes you happy? Physical changes may include: 1.Increased resting heart rate 2.Rise in blood pressure 3.Amplified immunoreactivity 4.Decrease in short term memory function 5.Changes in body fat distribution and composition 6.Thinning hair on head, arms, legs, and pubic area 7.Increased facial hair 8.Blood chemistry changes such as:  Raised cholesterol levels and elevated fasting insulin / glucose levels. Increase in bone turnover markers Positive ANA and increased inflammatory markers\xa0  How did that list make you feel? Think about it? If it makes you feel like you’re fighting a war, it should. It’s not much of a party, right? I encourage you to reject the idea these things WILL\xa0happen, or that if they do they are permanent. They are merely signs and symptoms. Signs that you indeed are having changing hormones. Changing hormonesis a part of the evolution of a woman’s life whether they occur at menopause or with surgery. You can opt to change. Change exercise. Change nutrition. Change lifestyle habits and break old patterns that will no longer work for you (hint: they weren’t working for you… you were lucky).\xa0 What do I mean by lucky? The science we had decades ago was the best we had. But if 39% of all sports medicine and exercise research features females right now, imagine the low percent that featured females 30 years ago.\xa0 Exercise plays a role in balancing these hormones and their reactions IF we use an exercise prescription that is HORMONE BALANCING, and not all people all the time. Bootcamps Mass bootcamps with all ages and levels … is very attractive to gyms and trainers. Let’s pack them in and charge a nominal rate but with dozens in a session it’s still a huge win. The energy and excitement is contagious. Unfortunately, injury rates climbed. There is no modification when it’s one or two trainers to 2, 4, or 6 dozen attendees. When others are driven you are driven and yet, that isn’t what every hormone imbalance needs. Group Fitness Classes are no different. Groups of 25 or 30 adults coming together to do either a workout dictated by the instructor’s mood or energy, or a pre-scripted program may not be what any individual needs at the moment. Once you know how hard you need to work and what kind of workout you need, group may work well for you. You know you and then you can choose the best options – and frequency for yourself. Let\'s talk about weight training. Why Weight Training Exercise for Hormone Balance Weight training is one of the absolute best things you can do for your hormone balance. Specifically targeting growth hormone, testosterone, cortisol, and insulin, with strength training you can introduce exercise without a sweat if that’s something you can do without. Though estrogen isn’t necessarily effected by weight training, it’s effects are addressed as bone density losses are slowed by weight training (and only weight training). There’s more. Additional hormones positively influenced by strength training are endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine. Though aerobic activity has always been associated with endorphins, don’t overlook strength training because the benefits seem to be equal. These hormones also bump cognitive performance long term. After a year of strength training women improved on executive planning abilities (problem solving and memory). \xa0There’s also a reduction in anxiety and depression. High volume lower-to-moderate intensity sets with short breaks works. Low-volume, high intensity sets with longer rest intervals works better. If you’re scared, just starting, opt for the high volume. Progress as you can (and assess on a joint by joint basis) to heavier weights for optimum hormone, bone, and muscle benefit. STRONGER I is a moderate to heavier and STRONGER III is a lighter weight higher volume program for both beginners and for developing “cut” or definition.\xa0 HIIT or S.I.T. (sprint interval training) Focus on an aerobic (or higher intensity which is referred to as anaerobic when you can’t sustain for periods longer than 30 seconds) with intermittent recovery periods. The total sessions should last 20-30 minutes at most. Weekly total HIIT times should be 45 minutes or less. After that time injury rates increase and benefits decrease. The body needs recovery from hard work in order to reap benefits. Prolonged endurance activity Disruption of the endocrine system tends to occur at varying levels for individuals. It is more common however in women who focus uniquely on endurance exercise without weight training or HIIT, and or who only add rather than removing to find a balance between activity. Time of day to exercise Intense early and light late is the Flipping 50 guideline. Testosterone levels are naturally higher in the morning. Strength and HIIT sessions that occur early also work with natural healthy cortisol patterns. Late day cortisol drops but your body is warm and loose. It’s the perfect time for “light late” activity like stretching and yoga or a light walk. If you need to accommodate your schedule, later in the day is fine for weight training. Keep your exercise pre-dinner. Avoid any exercise within 4 hours of bedtime. How hard when it’s high intensity? The key to benefits from Interval Training is high enough intensity. There’s got to be metabolic demand sufficient enough to cause change. That is why Flipping 50 recommends always reaching fatigue when you’re focused on body composition, metabolism, and positive hormone influence of exercise.\xa0 Fatigue during strength training is getting to a repetition that truly is the last one you can do. During intervals that is breathless. If you’re not doing either of those, you’re not influencing your metabolic-driven hormones and won’t experience the beneficial changes. Whether you want to boost libido, regain lost muscle tone, decrease fat, increase muscle mass to boost metabolism, or regulate blood sugar levels, proper intensity, in other words, training with purpose, not just random exercise is your goal.\xa0 Which hormones, again? These matter significantly. Testosterone slowly declines in women leading to menopause and then can drastically drop off. Bye bye libido and maybe your confidence at work. Increased testosterone can be induced by resistance training. Again, provided the stimulus is intense enough. Growth hormone and testosterone have been examined for their role in boosting strength or muscle mass. Especially among body builders. The actual role of them is backward. Resistance training improves levels of growth hormone and testosterone, not the other way around. Increases in growth hormone benefit collagen synthesis and fat burning. Testosterone as stated above supports better libido and energy. Both GH and testosterone support more muscle and lower fat. Resistance training supports the fountain of youth. If you\'re looking for support and understanding the science behind what\'s true and what\'s just always been accepted.. I\'d love to see you in the  course. Resources: Kraemer W, Ratamess N.

You may be one of our Flipping 50 Member Box subscribers and you’ll appreciate the knowledge behind this product I vetted for your box this month – which was all things to make your workout more effective, enjoyable, and beneficial. If you’re not already a member – and you’re into Christmas surprises and all the things that make fitness easier and want to avoid toxic products that mess with your hormones - I’ll link to details in the show notes for today’s episode. First of all, what is it? Hydrogen water is created when you add extra hydrogen molecules to water (which is already hydrogen and oxygen). You can buy it in a can, purchase a machine to split the molecules and add the hydrogen, or use a tablet which is what we’re talking about today. I tracked down Jeff Taraday, one of the co-owners of Trusii, creators of hydrogen tablets for this episode.\xa0 I asked him to share the need for Hydrogen with us. I did some research on this lesser talked about component of fitness nutrition and there is significant information available on the benefits of Hydrogen. Benefits that appeal to the Flipping 50 community that include bone health, reducing effects of oxidation on aging, improving mitochondrial function, weight loss and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Why don’t we hear more about this?\xa0 What led you to develop Trusii?\xa0 Many of you Flipping 50 audience members already take additional magnesium to supplement a multivitamin and Trusii lists magnesium on the ingredients list so I asked knowing you’d be curious about that.\xa0 I don’t love that the tablets contain dextrose – something our audience members are taught to seek out on a label. Can you comment on the reason and role dextrose is included?\xa0\xa0 There’s no denying that the benefits sound good. Here are some Jeff shared There are over 1100 peer-reviewed studies on benefits of hydrogen gas. There are a lot of animal studies so far, but fewer human studies, so I had to ask about any negative side affects. Numerous articles – several by doctors as well as pub med-published studies, showed no negative side effects to date including studies on patients after having undergone radiation treatments. What guidelines exist about this fitness nutrition supplement? Hydrogen water is GRAS-certified by the Food and Drug Administration, which means it’s generally recognized as safe. There aren’t any regulations or standards when it comes to dosage. I also ask the question about any existing studies featuring women in midlife specifically using H2 products and if so what were the results. I couldn’t find any specifically isolating women in perimenopause, menopause, or post menopause. That’s not a surprise, though there are tests done proving bone density, and improvements in Alzheimer’s, hearing, wrinkles, and ocular degeneration. It also reduces mitochondria damage and oxidative stress and muscular fatigue in athletes. What about results? How soon can you expect to feel results?\xa0 It depends on what you’re looking at.\xa0 Oxidative stress and inflammatory response to exercise was tested within hours of consumption of 1500 ml of hydrogen rich water for instance. Acute improvements in heart rate during submaximal exercise were also recorded after ingestion of H2 water the day before and day of exercise testing. Some of the brain benefits were recorded after 7 days in traumatic brain injured patients given H2 water. My bottomline is this: I’m going to use Trusii for the remaining 3 months of my training leading to Ironman Cozumel and journal about it in the blog. It’s going to be a staple in my fitness nutrition for these last big months of training. Flipping 50 Member Box subscribers are going to get the chance to try it too. If you’d like to join the Flipping 50 Member Box that gains you access to an exclusive members-only market area I’ll link to it below. I’ll also list the place to review Trusii if you want more information yourself and you can link to a pool of studies there.

Today, Jerry is the author of a popular children’s book that offers an important message that children of all ages need to hear. But that wasn’t always Jerry’s life.\xa0 Jerry grew up in a working-class Irish family and played football, and as he explains, there was always alcohol around. So Jerry became a heavy social drinker for over 30 years of his life. But eventually, Jerry began to get tired of the drinking. He wanted a break. He saw the ad for One Year No Beer after trying Dry January. He decided to do a 90-day challenge on his own, without joining OYNB. After completing it (and on April Fools Day) he opted to drink again and felt bad dealing with the resulting hangover. That was when he decided to take the plunge and join OYNB.\xa0 “I look back and I think did drinking affect what I do? It definitely did, it definitely did.”\xa0 Listen to the episode to hear more about Jerry’s journey, which has now reached over 500 days without drinking. Hear him explain how going alcohol-free improved his health and boosted his mental health and emotional stability. And listen in to hear Jerry’s surprising discovery of talent that he didn’t even know that he had – the ability to write a children’s story. In today’s episode, he’ll talk about how he came to write that story, why its message matters so much, and what’s next on the horizon.\xa0 OYNB LINKS\xa0\xa0\xa0 OYNB Website: https://www.oneyearnobeer.com/\xa0 OYNB Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/Oneyearnobeer/\xa0 OYNB Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/199505820380513/\xa0 OYNB Twitter: https://twitter.com/oynbuk/\xa0 OYNB Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/oneyearnobeer/\xa0 Email: info@oneyearnobeer.com\xa0 Let’s Do This! by Andy Ramage:  https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lets-Do-This-motivational-psychology/dp/1783253282/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=andy+ramage+lets+do+this&qid=1567684584&s=gateway&sr=8-3 JERRY LYON’S LINKS\xa0 Spot the Different: https://www.spotthedifferent.co.uk/ | How do you know when a fun social habit has turned into a problem? On today’s episode of One Year No Beer, we’re going to hear about \xa0the journey of Freddie Bennett-Willetts from a social drinker, to a heavy drinker, to a world record holder. Freddie talks about his journey, his past with alcohol, the excuses we make, the “perfect time” to start, and about the benefits of going alcohol-free. You might know Freddie as the “guy in the fisherman’s costume,” but around the office, he was known as the heavy drinker and the party-boy who was destroying himself. After changing his perception of his life, he let his journey change his life for the better. “To get the things you’ve always wanted, you have to do the things you’ve never done before.” Freddie delves into his history with social drinking as a teen in the 90’s. His social drinking quickly spiraled into a habit. While he was a well-behaved teen, he didn’t realize that his life was filled with drinking and heavy drinkers. As an adult—and after his father’s death—he knew he didn’t want his life to be a waste. But Freddie’s life hasn’t always been about alcohol. In the office, he always works hard. He is a dreamer, schemer, lover, father, and an adrenaline junkie. His kids helped push him even further and were a surprising source of inspiration as they were the reason he first thought about becoming the Guiness World Record holder for being “the fastest fisherman.” He talks about how his life could have turned out differently but instead of regrets, he’s turned to anticipation and productivity. Because of One Year No Beer, Freddie explains that he was able to change his life around. Not just with sobriety but by transforming from the asthmatic boy in school to the fastest fisherman in the world. He has also completed an Ironman triathlon, launched a new business, started meditating, journaling every day, and started writing a book. He has focused his addictive personality into a more positive outlet.\xa0 OYNB LINKS: OYNB Website: https://www.oneyearnobeer.com/\xa0 OYNB Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/Oneyearnobeer/\xa0 OYNB Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/199505820380513/\xa0 OYNB Twitter: https://twitter.com/oynbuk/\xa0 OYNB Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/oneyearnobeer/\xa0 Email: info@oneyearnobeer.com\xa0 \xa0 | This podcast is being reposted as a tribute to Sean, self-help author, therapist, and motivational speaker, who sadly died on Wednesday, August 28 2019, due to complications after suffering a head injury.\xa0 It can be easy to get sidetracked by your own fears, insecurities, and troubles. This may be especially true when you’re trying to accomplish something big, like giving up alcohol for a period of time. Without meaning to, you can begin to slide into negativity, allowing your fears and problems to take over and lapsing into unwanted behaviors or temptations. It can be hard to bring yourself back up when you’re going through those dark times and experiencing negative emotions. But today’s guest has some ideas about how to bounce back, take care of yourself, and make a positive impact on the world around you. Dr. Sean Stephenson was born with osteogenesis imperfecta, a condition that is otherwise known as brittle bone syndrome. By the time he was 18 years old, he had already broken over 200 bones in his body. He likes to say that he was given 24 hours to live by the doctors when he was born – but now, more than 30 years later, he’s the only doctor still alive. In today’s interview, Dr. Stephenson talks about the importance of perspective and being able to bounce back from dark places. One way that he deals with challenges is by reaching out and helping people who are going through bigger challenges. He explains that helping people with their problems can take your mind off your own struggles. Dr. Stephenson also shares the three factors of his unstoppable formula: impeccable self-care, self-purpose, and an empowering environment. He says these are the things that you need in order to overcome your insecurities, achieve your goals, and overcome your negative habits. Tune in to the episode to hear the whole inspiring interview.

If you’ve never thought about it, now is the time to give it some thought. On today’s episode of One Year No Beer, Dr. Mahmoud Ghannoum explains what an imbalance in the gut biome is, what happens when you have an imbalance, and what alcohol has to do with it. \xa0\xa0 Dr. Ghannoum is the author of the book Total Gut Balance. He explains how people get involved with his organization, Biohm, and what happens when people have a gut imbalance. He explains that people usually want to know what they can do to rebalance their gut – which foods and lifestyle changes will help. \xa0\xa0 “I direct the center for medical mycology which is the fungal research. That’s why I’m known as a fun guy.”\xa0 Dr. Ghannoum also talks about the role that alcohol plays in the gut biome, especially in relation to problems like IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome).

Today’s guest says that he plans to live to 100, and understands that if he wants to work and build and create all the things that he wants to do in that time, then it’s important to get started now.\xa0 Richie Crowley has been alcohol-free for about two years now. He stresses the importance of health, wellness, meditation, and connecting with others. Richie points out that while people often encourage their friends to leave toxic relationships and workplaces, they don’t necessarily encourage them to change toxic ways of living, and that the relationship with alcohol is a toxic one for many people.\xa0 “There’s just so many different things that I want to build and create and work on and be a part of in this life, that I look at and say hey, the clock is ticking in a way, let me start doing it all.”\xa0 In today’s episode, Richie talks about his current adventure, a bike ride across America. Richie will be starting his ride in Boston, Massachusetts, and finishing in Los Angeles, California. Along the way, he plans to meet and connect with people from communities that he’s never visited before and share what he knows about health, wellness, and meditation with the people who need to hear it.\xa0 Richie wants to make connections and show the importance of connections, and he believes that there’s no time to waste.

Pete Cohen joins the One Year No Beer podcast to talk about addiction, delayed gratification, and meditation, among other things.\xa0 Pete describes his own background when it comes to drinking. He says that he began drinking at around age 14 and that the pub he went to never asked for ID until shortly before he turned 18. Pete also says that drugs were accessible and available where he lived, but some early bad experiences prevented him from getting seriously involved. Pete says that his college was a sports college with a heavy drinking culture. Now, however, Pete says that he values feeling healthy and being able to get up early in the morning more than he wants to drink. Pete worked as a personal trainer and got a degree in sport science. He says that his goal is to help give people a different perspective.\xa0 “For me, I just love getting to that place where I feel like there’s possibility.” On the subject of willpower, Pete says that the human ability to delay gratification is where the real power lies. He talks about how making choices and getting better at something can cause momentum and energize people, which is what he feels that One Year No Beer is accomplishing. He believes that if people can quit drinking, they will feel empowered to accomplish other things as well.\xa0 Pete also talks about the power of meditation and the power of feeling possibility. He discusses the importance of having a coach and of people helping each other as they work to reinvent themselves. He explains the importance of not only finding your own why but also buying into your own why and then using that emotional connection to achieve your goals and have an impact on the people around you.

It’s an achievement that deserves to be celebrated. And what’s the best way to celebrate an alcohol-free year? Why not with a Spartan race?\xa0 In today’s episode, Ruari talks to Zoe Grant and Sharon Hartley not only about their experiences going alcohol-free but also about their experiences running a Spartan Race. The interview was recorded in a tent at a Spartan event, shortly after Zoe finished her first race. And though she signed up for the race much earlier, the event itself came just after finishing her one year challenge. “I knew it was like the ultimate, ultimate celebration, actually. And I knew I’d cry.” Zoe talks about herself and her experiences before joining One Year No Beer. She says that she was a low-level constant drinker, drinking just one glass a night, every night. She realized later that the alcohol was keeping her anxiety high, but without it, she was happier and less anxious. She explains that things have changed a lot over the last year and that she spent a lot of that time discovering herself.\xa0 Zoe and Sharon discuss the connections that they’ve made in the group and what it feels like to meet up in person with people who have been supporting you in your alcohol-free challenge in the group. They talk about the importance of making connections with people who are experiencing or have experienced the same things.\xa0 They also talk about what the first month or so without alcohol is like, and how it can be exciting to watch the days add up into weeks and months. They explain what it’s like to go out to restaurants or bars without drinking and how, over time, it gets easier to bat away negative comments about not drinking. Listen to the episode to hear the whole conversation and what it’s like to celebrate an alcohol-free year with a Spartan race.\xa0 OYNB LINKS\xa0 OYNB Website: https://www.oneyearnobeer.com/ OYNB Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/Oneyearnobeer/ OYNB Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/199505820380513/ OYNB Twitter: https://twitter.com/oynbuk/ OYNB Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/oneyearnobeer/ Email: info@oneyearnobeer.com | If you’re new to One Year No Beer, or if you’re just considering taking a challenge and starting to change your relationship with alcohol, you may be wondering not just about the short-term challenge, but what going alcohol-free might look like in the long term. In today’s episode, you’ll hear from a long-time member of One Year No Beer about her journey from her first challenge in 2017 to now.\xa0 Louise Vickers discovered One Year No Beer in January of 2017. She had done Dry January a few times before and was planning on doing it again, so she decided to go to a party and drink on December 31st. The night ended with Louise breaking several of her toes. She describes herself sitting on her couch the next day, resting her sore foot and scrolling through Facebook, when she came across an ad for One Year No Beer and decided to give it a try.\xa0 “I think me finding me took longer than 90 days. It maybe even took longer than the 365.”\xa0 Louise started out with a 90-day challenge and then decided to try the 365-day challenge next. She says that before she found OYNB, she was a partier, but that her hangovers were starting to last two days instead of one, and that she was experiencing a lot of anxiety during a hangover as well. Louise describes herself as a goal-driven and deadline driven person, so she decided to set a goal of one event a month along with her alcohol-free challenge. And despite the broken toes that kept her from completing a physical event in January of 2017, she still managed to complete 12 events that year.\xa0 Louise says that the first 90 days were tough but going to events and completing challenges gave her a way to channel her energy and adrenaline. Louise also says that without alcohol, she was able to discover more things about herself and feel her feelings more fully.\xa0 Louise explains that at some point, she began substituting sugar for alcohol, and she’s now working on weight loss and healthier living. She says that she’s using the same tools that she learned when originally cutting out alcohol now to meet her new goals. She says that she still loves the OYNB group and that she’s now approaching 900 days without alcohol. Listen to the episode to hear more of Louise’s story in her own words.\xa0 OYNB LINKS\xa0 OYNB Website: https://www.oneyearnobeer.com/ OYNB Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/Oneyearnobeer/ OYNB Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/199505820380513/ OYNB Twitter: https://twitter.com/oynbuk/ OYNB Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/oneyearnobeer/ Email: info@oneyearnobeer.com | Everyone knows about rehabilitation facilities and Alcoholics Anonymous, but what is out there for people who want to live a healthier, alcohol-free life or who want to moderate their drinking, but aren’t in need of interventions or total permanent abstinence? One Year No Beer provides one community for people in those situations, and today’s guest is also helping to create a community by hosting events for the sober curious and talking about her own journey with alcohol and with giving up alcohol.\xa0 Janey Lee Grace is a television presenter and radio personality who’s been featured on BBC Radio 2. She was a singer who toured with Wham and performed alongside artists like Boy George and George Michael. Today, she’s a journalist and an alcohol-free inspirationalist. “You actually get younger when you get sober.”\xa0 Janey says that when you give up drinking, you’re actually giving more than you’re giving up. Abstaining from alcohol improves health and relationships and reduces anxiety. Janey says that even her eyesight has improved since she quit drinking.\xa0 Although Janey has a background in health, wellbeing, and holistic wellness, she explains that she didn’t change her diet or do any other special health-related work while she was in the process of getting sober. She says that she felt she needed to just focus on getting sober and that she actually ate more sugar in the beginning. Janey explains that sometimes you need to put your energy and focus into doing one thing – in this case, getting sober – and it’s OK not to also be trying to lose weight or avoid sugar during that time.\xa0 Janey has partnered with a charity called My Yard to host Self Care for the Sober Curious events for people who are trying to get sober or who are considering it. My Yard is a small charity that focuses on providing healthy food for people in crisis, and they found that in the course of that work, they encountered a lot of people who were dealing with alcohol and substance dependence issues. These free events are meant to help people who want to cut down or quit drinking meet other people who feel the same way.\xa0 Janey explains that she kept her alcohol-free journey quiet at first, but going public with it helped her by providing accountability and community. She now hosts a podcast called Alcohol Free Life where she speaks to authors, experts, and other guests about living a sober life.

Whitney. The Badwater 135 is billed as the\xa0most demanding and extreme running race offered anywhere on the planet. The start line is at Badwater Basin, Death Valley, which marks the lowest elevation in North America at 280’ below sea level. The race finishes at the Whitney Portal at 8,300’, the highest point in the contiguous United States. In just over 36 hours, Tim covered three mountain ranges for a total of 14,600’ of cumulative vertical ascent! Tim isn’t just an accomplished athlete, but also a dedicated husband and father of three children. He’s also a physician, and president and chief executive officer of The Spine & Nerve Centers in Charleston, West Virginia. Not only do he and Matt go into the nitty-gritty of the training and racing, but they also speak globally about the importance of health, fitness, goal-setting, and having a trusting support system. He also draws on the many parallels between racing and being a doctor -focusing on a plan, keeping calm under pressure, not being afraid to deviate when necessary. You may not have the desire to race an event like Badwater, but it is our hope that you will be inspired to take positive action in your life, just like Tim Deer - the epitome of someone who is reaching their human potential via their athletic potential. \xa0 To submit a question to the podcast, visit https://www.purplepatchfitness.com/podcast and fill out the podcast question form. \xa0 \xa0 Copyright 2019 All Rights Reserved | Malindi Elmore is the queen of evolution. Growing up in Canada, she knew early on that running was her passion. This, after all, was a girl who was more excited about winning the 100-meter dash than the spelling bee in school. She was raised as a multi-sport athlete who participated in soccer, field hockey, skiing, waterskiing, running, and hiking, but running was her passion, and coaches took notice early on. By 12 years old, she decided it would be the sport that would take her to the Olympics. \xa0 After a stellar middle-distance career at Stanford, she went on to run professional and put her efforts into qualifying for the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Her dreams came true on July 1st, 2004 when she won the Canadian Track and Field Championships in 4:04 and was selected to the Olympic Team. \xa0 Elmore retired from professional running in 2012 and, after the birth of her first son Charlie, dove headfirst into the waters of long-distance triathlon (under Coach Matt Dixon) where she raced a sub 9:00 hour Ironman in 2016, placing 3rd in her first Ironman event.\xa0 While she enjoyed the variety of Multisport training and earning her pro card, the birth of her second child evolved priorities once again and Malindi transitioned back to her first love - RUNNING. This time? Her focus was on the marathon. In January 2019, just six months after the birth of her second child,\xa0 Elmore ran a 2:32 at the Houston Marathon. As she writes, “A 2:32 marathon left me hungry for more and brought an old flame back into my life: the pursuit of the 2020 Olympic Games.\xa0 I realize I have a narrow window left to do some amazing things as an athlete in the sport as I will be 40 years old next year and my clock is ticking!” There are, no doubt, many lessons to learn from this passionate coach, athlete, wife, and mother.

Chelsea\xa0fell in love with running, which took her through college at Cal Berkeley along with\xa0a post-collegiate professional running career. She may be a superhuman on the track, but she is also very human, having suffered frustrating injuries and setbacks that kept her from having the running career that she truly desired. But, just like the rest of us, she was inspired by the 2016 Rio Olympic triathlon. She loved watching the build-up to that race and decided to give the sport a go knowing it would provide a new outlet for athletics and beneficial cross-training. Today, she’s just a couple of years into her professional career and in the process of writing history. Chelsea landed on the podium in both of her 70.3 races in 2018, including an overall win at Indian Wells 70.3.\xa0 She opens up with Matt today on her past and the valuable lessons that triathlon has brought into her life.

The coaching cue I give on the first rep of a new drill more than any other is “it’s a new drill, it’s cool, first rep you’ll sort it out, here we go” and let them find it before we start nailing them with all these specific cues and details”“One of our taglines is “Humans First, Athletes Second, Football Players Third””“When we are dealing with athletes that aren’t anywhere close to their genetic potential, everything is improving everything”“For the sake of a coach’s resume, we’re going to have a kid do one thing, and he’s going to be useful for the team because he does one thing, and that sounds great for a victory-centric model, | Today’s episode features Miguel Aragoncillo, strength coach and skill acquisition specialist based out of Boston, MA.\xa0 Miguel has worked with athletes of all levels, and now specializes in working with baseball pitchers where he is getting serious results through integration of skill and motor learning tools.\xa0 Miguel has a significant background in PRI and worked as an assistant in multiple courses.\xa0 He also has a unique athletic backstory, as he was a break-dancer before moving into a coaching role.Miguel is one of the most intelligent and innovative coaches in the field.\xa0 He is pushing human performance forward by integrating what he has learned in the world of strength and conditioning, neuro-mechanics and skill acquisition, and is using that to get results such as tacking 5-7MPH on pitching speed in a matter of minutes.Our field is still growing at a rapid rate.\xa0 Although hard-line definitions of the scope of a strength coach definitely exist in the university and professional sectors, there is no doubt as to the inter-disciplinary nature of sports performance, as well as the impact that the wide-scope of S&C related concepts can have on the next level up on the performance pyramid, that of sport skill itself.\xa0 This is something that Mike Guadango mentioned in podcast #151, and has been resonating with me for some time.Miguel’s intelligent take on the performance industry has been on my radar for some time.\xa0 On today’s show, Miguel and I chat about guiding athletes in the process of skill acquisition, through processes on creating drills to improve sport skills, integrating biomechanical and PRI based concepts, and also setting up sport skill training through sensory contrasts.Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.Key Points How Miguel got into strength and conditioning, and eventually, into coaching baseball pitchers How to guide athletes correctly in skill acquisition without over-cueing and over-coaching Miguel’s thought process on creating drills to improve sport skills Integrating biomechanics and PRI based concepts into a sport skill teaching process Setting up sport skill training through sensory contrast How Miguel sets of resistance training for young athletes outside of actual skill coaching“If I’m trying to help individuals to throw faster, I can get them to deadlift 500lbs for reps, to have vertical jumps and bounds for so many feet, we can do RSI, etc. etc., but what happens when someone simply doesn’t know what it means to throw”“You don’t need a lot of drills in order to improve one’s relationship with one’s own body”“When we do any movement, I show them the movement, and then I ask them, “what do you feel”…. “where do you feel”, “what do you feel”, why do you feel it””“I’m allowing the individual to self-organize on the context of building a better mental representation of what their body is doing”“Internal cueing, in my head, is a good thing… because even sometimes the experts will need an internal cue to be more aware of something that they are lacking”“The funny thing is you are always using some type of constraints, but you are not really thinking of it like that”“I will literally just say, do you want me to explain this drill, or do you just want to do it”“Pitching is both a frontal and transverse dominant plane”“When you do a non-manual technique of some sort to gain range of motion, now you need to go through a guided discovery process doing the terminal skillsets with different constraints, and that’s where it gets fun”“If you ever watch me coach, I almost never say no… I’ve read a lot of research speaking about negative feedback.\xa0 It’s something I’ve picked up and I found out it works really well”“We will do an integrated movement, we feel certain things, | Today’s episode features an expert roundtable on an integrative view of single and double leg (unilateral and bilateral) training.\xa0 Experts include Cal Dietz, author of Triphasic Training and University of Minnesota strength coach, Cameron Josse, director of sports performance at DeFranco’s gym (co-author of “The Process”), and Chad Dennis, veteran NCAA and professional level strength coach who is now director of performance for the XFL Seattle Dragons.Single and double leg training is hotly debated in many cases, each method with its own unique aspects, benefits and drawbacks.\xa0 In the majority of situations, single leg training is used as a warmup or auxillary while the “big lifts” dominate the landscape of exercise.\xa0 Taking a wider view of these training modalities is important when it comes to optimal integration into our own training.On the show today, myself, Cal, Cameron and Chad go over many ideas on this topic, particularly the idea of using single leg training as the primary method in earlier training phases (accumulation, GPP, etc.) and moving towards bilateral dominated training in later training phases (intensification, SPP, etc.).We also take a deep dive into the neurological aspects of barbell (and jump) training, as the ramifications of movements with many, vs. few degrees of freedom (i.e. a walking rotational lunge vs. a heavy quarter squat).\xa0\xa0 This episode is rounded out by a chat on unilateral jumping progressions and using dynamic work to prepare tissues for the rigors of high intensity training and in-season play.Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.Key Points A thesis summary of building a foundation of single leg training and then filtering into double leg training Different approaches to periodization and planning in regards to single and double leg training Neurological Ramifications of unilateral vs. bilateral training via threat response Approaches to jump training periodization looking at single and double leg periodization A discussion on using unilateral work in the weightroom, and on field (jumps and sprints) to prepare tissues of the body for the season“I’m looking at a \xa0progression where we start with a foundation of coordination (single leg/more degrees of freedom) and we transfer that into really high outputs (bilateral training)” ~Cam Josse“Unilateral work favors the cross crawl concept” ~Dietz“I’m not a big fan of single leg squat with dumbbells, because I don’t feel there is enough stress, in my opinion” ~Dietz“In the bilateral (lifting and even plyometric), I didn’t get a good neural feedback loop” ~Dietz“I haven’t found one of my athletes that didn’t go into threat with a double leg, or get better (neurological) responses from a split squat stance” ~Dietz“How do I fix that threat? I just have them march.\xa0 If they do a hurdle hop, the next four steps are marching steps, and that takes them out of that threat as they go to the next exercise” ~Dietz“There was a great tissue resiliency built from doing (single leg rudiment hops, filtering into bounding over time, as well as a unilateral to bilateral progression in the weightroom) from the joints, especially in the lower leg” ~Dennis“It makes a lot of sense to use unilateral training in the early during these early periods in the training year, it could be 6-8 weeks, it could be 4 weeks really.\xa0 I’m thinking field first, weightroom second” ~Josse“If you are in the weightroom, it’s naturally multi-planar, just because you are on one leg more degree of freedom are involved” ~Josse“If we are concentrating speed and power on the field, how do we support that in the weightroom? Bilateral activities” ~Josse“While we are emphasizing force and accumulation, we are thinking mostly unilateral with a gradual shift... | Today’s episode features Doug Kechijian, therapist, coach and owner of Resilient Performance Systems.\xa0 Resilient’s clientele includes athletes and operators from a variety of professional and collegiate sports, as well as, federal law enforcement tactical teams, military special operations forces, and those with a history of persistent pain and extensive surgical backgroundsBefore beginning his sports medicine practice, Doug was a Pararescueman in the U.S. Air force where he deployed throughout the world to help provide technical rescue capability and emergency medical care to U.S and allied forces. \xa0Additionally, Doug is the host of the “Resilient Performance Podcast” featuring a number of thought leaders.Doug is introspective, humble, and transparent.\xa0 His diverse experience and education, as well as his own practice of learning and reading has given him an wide lens perspective on many domains of the human performance sector. \xa0As a field (and with anything) it’s easy to make noise, or get noticed, based on extreme viewpoints, often talking about avoiding a common practice in coaching, such as “don’t squat”, “don’t lift weights”, “don’t internal cue”, “don’t do drills”, “don’t foam roll”, etc.Doug is a coach who really makes me think in his drive to find the truth in things, and avoid the tribe mentality in coaching stances.\xa0 In the spirit of that, I wanted to tackle some facets of the field that tend to be looked at in a black and white frame, but in reality are more grey, which is in the realms of rotational core training, self-organization and when to intervene in coaching versus letting athletes figure things out themselves unimpeded.Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.Key Points Doug’s transition from the military to physical therapy and his approach to learning and growing in the field Concepts on core-bracing and anti-rotation versus a more fluid and dynamic view on trunk training Ideas on self-organization in athletics: when and how to intervene“When you prepare to be good enough at a lot of different things, you recognize patterns and commonalities across these skillsets, across these diverse fields”“When it comes to learning, people love formulas… but now I realize that learning is a lot more messy”“There is always this range between being a specialist and a generalist”“I think reading outside your field is what helps you to connect dots and see the bigger picture”“Scientists and all us of want to prove certain things, and often times, just confirm our biases”“If you don’t see the bigger picture, then that’s where we get these silos between strength and conditioning, and physical therapy, and sport coaches, and all of these things exist on a continuum”“For most people, I don’t know if a palloff press is dynamic enough or challenging enough… you want to integrate that stiffness in a contextually specific way”“I don’t teach people specific bracing techniques, because people do that stuff reflexively well, with the caveat that you’re putting them in a good position”“We’ve made lifting weights way too difficult, it’s not calculus”“Every intervention has un-intended consequences”“If the key to rotational performance is to relax and get really stiff…. If that’s what we are really chasing from a rotational performance standpoint, if we are tell people when they do these activities to deliberately brace, are we inhibiting their ability to relax?”“If you only have one way to do something, then under stress, you have no options!”“I think it’s dangerous to assume that every movement that emerges organically is best for the athlete, because it might not be a choice, so you want to give people choices and at least give them the requisite foundational joint positions or motor skills, | Today’s episode features Greg Potter.\xa0 Greg is a former sprint coach (he has written some fantastic Q and A pieces for Just Fly Sports in the past regarding all things sprint training) who is now a Ph.D and expert on Circadian Rhythms and their impact on our health and well-being.Greg is the former content director at HumanOS.me and now works as the chief scientific officer of a health-tech startup. \xa0Greg’s work at the University of Leeds on sleep, diet, and metabolic health was featured by the likes of the BBC World Service, the Washington Post, and Reuters. As a sprint coach, Greg coached a sprinter to four gold medals at the European Championships. Greg has also worked with groups such as The United States Naval Special Warfare Command on health and performance optimization.Today’s show is all about our body’s “clocks” (Circadian Rhythms) impact our health, metabolism, ability to train, and our ability to recover via sleep.\xa0 It’s important to know how to train, but it’s also critical, especially in our modern digital age, to understand how to better recover and live based off of our innate wirings.Topics addressed on today’s show include the basics of circadian rhythms and impact on nutrition, sleep, training, and metabolism (fat loss).\xa0 Greg also gives plenty of tips and ideas on how to optimize our lives based off our own circadian rhythms.\xa0 The back half of the show in particular has a lot of great concepts on training optimization based on time of day.Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.Key Points What circadian rhythms are and what they mean to us What the modern lifestyle (in terms of artificial light cycles and ever-abundant foot availability) means for our health and function The metabolic advantages of early day, time restricted eating Nutritional concepts in a non-training day for a speed-power athlete who wants to stay lean Greg’s take on the ketogenic diet Ideas on timing multiple workouts in a day with various emphasis Variation in VO2 max based on time of day The importance of naps for strength and power performance The importance of body temperature in speed and power performance Artificial light and its impact on our daily rhythms and clocks How to use light-based products and apps to help synchronize the body clock“The most important time cue in resetting our biological rhythms with the 24 hour day is the light/dark cycle and the problem of course is that now we live these 24/7 life cycles where we have artificial light cycles at night, we spend too much time indoors during the day time, we have round-the-clock food access, and because of all these different factors we behave in a way that is discordant with our biological rhythms”“Our bodies are best set to digest food in the daytime”“Insulin sensitivity is higher in the daytime than the nighttime, our bodies are primed for eating during the daytime”“Skipping breakfast is associated with negative health outcomes and eating at nighttime is associated with negative health outcomes”“(For time restricted eating) I would stick to a 6-12 hour caloric period that finishes at least 2 hours before you plan to go to bed, but earlier than that is probably better.”“What we want is a nice high-amplitude rhythm in core body temperature… it’s generally highest in the late afternoon, which is the best time for strength and power exercise for that reason”“I think it’s smart to give our digestive tracts a break each 24 hours”“(Peripheral clocks) seem to be primarily set by our food intakes each day”“I would recommend that your final meal of the day is relatively small compared to others”“When people consume regular meals at scheduled times, they tend to burn more calories after consuming those meals” | Today’s episode features founder of Achieve Performance, Jeremy Frisch, and guest co-host, Dr. Tommy John.\xa0 Both of these individuals are making a big difference in not only the world of youth sports, but also in teaching the importance of global human movement skills, as well as in bringing the importance of movement as a necessary and healing force to the general population.Jeremy Frisch has been a past guest on episodes 100\xa0and 134, and Dr. Tommy John has been a guest on 101\xa0and 139.\xa0\xa0 These two guys both have a passion for redeeming what our sports industry has become in regards to not only sky-rocketing injuries, but also restoring the core of what it means to be a kid, an athlete, and a human being, which is creativity, play, and free movement, before external parameters, competition, stress and judgment are all added through early specialization and over-coaching.We spend a lot of time zooming in on things like sets, reps, exercise modalities and training blocks.\xa0 At the end of the day, these factors are important, but the long term process by which athletes are facilitated, and the joy that happens when this is done correctly, is an area of our industry that truly demands our focus and attention.\xa0 Knowing how to progress youth athletes, and also how to integrate sport coaching with physical preparation on all levels of performance helps us all become more aware and well-rounded in our coaching process.On today’s show, Jeremy, Tommy and I discuss changes in coaching emphasis from youth through adult, the importance of a thorough warmup that covers a variety of movement skills, how Jeremy’s experience as a youth sport coach has helped his process and integration in physical preparation, the importance and relevance of free play for children vs. organized coaching, and much more.Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.\xa0Key Points How perception of watching adult athletes changes when you have experience watching children learn and play How moving non-injured body parts and joints is critical in the process of injury and recovery How coaching changes from working from youth to high school, to adult trainees How to structure a warmup to provide a powerful strength and movement stimulus, as why this is the most important part of the total workout in many cases Jeremy’s experiences as a youth sport coach (e.g. football, baseball, tennis), how he incorporates physical preparation methods, and how this work has impacted his physical preparation coaching The reasons that un-structured play is superior to organized sports for athletic (and personal) development in children Why pickup basketball is crucial for creative development in basketball players, even if it seems like a “lazy” pace Is it possible to build skills later in life if a kid missed the window of development early on“When we were kids, when we got hurt, what did we do? As quick as we could we got back outside trying to play… it’s like we knew intuitively that moving around makes you heal”“When he got done squatting, when they took the cast off his arm, his arm had more muscle on it than when he started… he did 20 rep breathing squats and that… like 3x a week (being unable to train his arms in that time period)”“The majority of young athletes coming in, their feet are shot, and if their feet are shot, their hips are going to be shot”“When you start with a\xa0 kid, the change from play to more organized stuff starts when he or she is ready… I’ve had kids who are just studs physically, are they are the most immature kids in the whole world, so I pulled them back because if I tried to organized things to much, they shut down and they don’t come back.”“For ages 13,14,15 it’s more technical based, for ages 16-19 we are cleaning, | Today’s episode features javelin coach and athlete Kevin Foster.\xa0 Kevin is a former Division I javelin thrower for the University of Connecticut. He is currently training to compete post-collegiately as an athlete for the 2020 Olympic Trials in the javelin event.\xa0 Kevin works as a private trainer and consultant, specializing in javelin.A young coaching prodigy, Kevin is one of the brightest and holistic young minds in the field.\xa0 He has been a prolific writer for Just Fly Sports in the last couple of years, and owns the popular Instagram page @javelin.anatomy.\xa0 Kevin is integrating ideas from many great minds in training, such as former podcast guests such as David Weck, Ben Patrick and Adarian Barr.\xa0 He is also familiar with ideas from DNS (Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization) and Ido Portal, alongside many others.This episode is all about getting to the core of what it means to be athletic.\xa0 Kevin clearly asks the question of what are we missing out on by just thinking about force from a quantitative perspective, and ignoring the total design and abilities of the body in respect to movement.\xa0 The more we know and understand about what makes the best athletes in the world the best, the more we can infuse this into our own coaching process.On today’s show, Kevin talks about some technical aspects of the javelin throw and throwing in general from a perspective of the feet, elbows and hands.\xa0 He gets deep into the elastic potential of the body from a perspective of waveforms and body segments, essentially, things that make an elite athlete able to transfer energy properly.\xa0 Of a particular focus on this show is Kevin’s take on the feet, hips and spine in making the ultimate elastic athlete. If you don’t care about javelin throw, or throwing concepts skills in general for that matter, you may want to skip to around 20-25 minutes into the talk.Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.Key Points How coiling the body shows up in Kevin’s training for javelin How “pistol finger” works to lock the front big toe in throwing How the tongue works to direction tension to different parts of the body in athletics Examples of how Kevin trains throws from the perspective of the feet The importance of spinal segmentation in athletic performance and practical training What inspired Kevin to consider training on the level of energy and waveforms How to unlock the bodies elastic potential and why it is important to do so before optimizing other forms of training“How you conceptualize the throw matters, if you just view the throw as a series of body parts moving you are going to set yourself up for very thinking brain, very rigid movement”“With the opposite hand when you are throwing, you need to be thinking about pronation in the hand of the reaching arm”“The tongue can direct tension to different parts of the body, so if you look at pictures of Jan Zelezny on his javelin release, you’ll see his tongue pushing into different parts of his mouth”“Movement is more than muscle… focusing on (squat routines and VBT) is focusing on the 1% compared to the 99%”“The feet and the hips and the spine are all connected in a much bigger way than we normally give credit for, so getting strong arches and capsular hip internal rotation, those are two ways to take slack out of system, so that’s how become fascially dominant as an athlete, to get that slack out of the system, it’s that neurofascial remodeling that takes place”“You need spinal segmentation, you need to be able to move every vertebrae to transfer energy optimally”“In order to unlock fascia driven movement, you need to strengthen the arches, you need to develop the ability to internally rotate your hips, and you need the ability to segment your spine”“First we’re humans, | Today’s episode features Dr. Ben House.\xa0 Dr. House\xa0has a Ph.D. in Nutrition from the University of Texas at Austin, is also a Nutritionist (CN), Functional Diagnostic Nutritionist (FDN), and Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner (CFMP).Functional Medicine is Ben’s life’s passion. He has studied under some of the best in the world and continues to regularly attend and present at conferences and seminars around the world.\xa0 As a strength coach, House has worked at both the high school and collegiate levels, including time under Coach Wright at the University of Texas Basketball. Besides practicing Functional Medicine, coaching, and writing articles for Functional Medicine Costa Rica, House has numerous publications in peer-reviewed, high-impact scientific journals.I first found Ben’s work on the Train Adapt Evolve website several years ago, and seeing his journey to practicing functional medicine and leading retreats in Costa Rica in the time since been nothing short of inspiring.\xa0 Ben is a versatile and exciting guest because of his experience and knowledge of multiple aspects of human beings, from nutrition, to physiology, to training concepts, to meditation, restoration and recovery.\xa0 Ben has a tremendous knowledge of the associated research, and how this fits in with many current training trends.On today’s show, Ben talks about meditation, recovery methods to calm athletes down from training, his take on the concept of training from a hormonal perspective, and also how to simplify corrective methods such as PRI into a user-friendly training session.Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.Key Points: Quick thoughts from Ben on the Westernization and use of meditation Means of getting athletes in recovery mode post-exercise session How to use breathing and other integrated means to get athletes calmed down post workout Sympathetic and parasympathetic states and training Types of training and effects on the anabolic and hormonal processes of the body Differences between males, females and testosterone (or lack therof) Simplifying and integrating PRI based ideals into a training program“We’ve really westernized meditation”“People who have been meditating for 25 years, they kind of rest on that default mode network, so they are more present, less reactive”“People would generally rather shock themselves then sit in silence”“You could turn (post-workout box breathing) into a repositioning exercise… there are so many different ways you could take it, you could do body scans, you could do a Feldenkrais class”“For some people who really like to train, their only stress reliever in life is another stress reliever… we have to give them other tools.\xa0 I find that a lot of people that I coach have two stress relievers, one of them is food, and another one is exercise.\xa0 Those are two coping strategies that I really don’t want people to use with stress”“Our mindset around stress is very important, if we believe we are going to break, stress is very debilitating”“I would never chase something happening in the endocrine system with my training”“Females generally can put 85% of the muscle on as men, relatively they can put on (almost) as much muscle as men and they have 1/20th of the testosterone”“Unfortunately, we’ve been looking at a good indicator of over-training or over-reaching for a really long time, and none of the hormones really pan out as far as a 2017 meta-analysis”“What is the best marker we have for over-training?\xa0 It is an increase in training volume or training intensity, met with a decrease in performance”“Just sciency enough, just bothers me so much, because a lot of people are trying to sell a simple story with science”“I spent 4 years of my life on meal frequency to come ou... | Today’s episode features nutrition consultant and performance coach, Matt Cooper.\xa0 Matt is a bright young mind who I’ve had many conversations with in my recent journey of human performance.\xa0 He was the guest for episode #121 where he talked about many training concepts, including the potential neurological drawbacks of excessive training under heavy barbell loads.Today’s show is a chat about holistic training integration, where Matt covers the elements of stress, recovery, nutrition and energy systems. \xa0Being a masterful coach represents knowing not only the “big rocks” of training, but also excelling at the subtle aspects of training athletes.\xa0 I believe that success is found in a mastery of the subtleties, and today’s episode covers a great many of them.\xa0\xa0 This is definitely a show for dedicated coaches, athletes and trainees who want to cover all bases in their training process.Topics Matt will specifically get into include all things stress, light, energy systems, mitochondria, caloric restriction, ketogenic implications for athletes, nutrient intake and hormonal fluctuations, and finally, the impact of nutritionally derived inflammation on pain and injury.Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.Key Points Where Matt starts with nutrition How to determine if you are oxidative or sugar burning using breathing measurements Nutritional stress and the workout window Matt’s take on nutritionally supporting the nervous system through nutrition How to have a robust mitrochondrial density How to approach fasting and calorie restriction from an athletic perspective Nutrient intake throughout the day and it’s impact on branches of the autonomic nervous system/carb backloading The impact of nutritionally derived inflammation and injuries“A big mistake is having guys load in nutrients closer to when guys are going to be more in the sympathetic state”“You might have someone take oscillating days of higher carbohydrate and lower carbohydrate temporarily, just based on what energy system they are using”“If you are mainly nasal breathing, you are more aerobic dominant for the most part, and that is going to keep you from going into an excess state of fight or flight, but if you are more of a mouth breather, that is probably going to make you transition your gears to go into more of a sympathetic state sooner, which is going to result in you utilizing more of that precious stored glycogen reserve that you have”“You are still using all of the energy pathways at once, the question is “which one are you going to be most dominant in””“High grade Omega 3-Fish Oil can really tune parts of the nervous system”“I like getting guys on a really comprehensive either plant or ocean mineral blend to help motor neuron volley and transmission”“(In regards to having a robust mitochondrial density) Sleeping enough, getting in a nutrient dense diet, respecting your light cycles.. making sure you see morning light, making sure you see evening light, being respectful of the light cycles you see later in the day”“A lot of the basic supplements out there don’t have great bio-availablity”“(In caloric restriction) you are actually resetting some of those insulin receptors that help with some of that “gun-clip” type storage of carbohydrates”“Energy system development \xa0needs to be looked at from a nutritional perspective, not just a training perspective”“That keto(genic) ratio that was invented… was more for medical cases”“Metabolic flexibility is the goal”“Don’t forget that most soft tissue injuries are exacerbated by nutrition, basically via inflammation of the nerves causing pain”“When you fix someone’s diet (in terms of inflammation), people can tend to see a higher degree of their brain’s own current without i... | Today’s episode features Jake Schuster, sports performance coach, consultant and researcher hailing

Recognizing the local need (in Tampa, Florida) to develop advocacy on behalf of children without a voice, became the catalyst for South African Natasha Nascimento, to tackle what has evolved into a modern version of slavery head-on.  While working as a Financial Adviser with Anti-Trafficking Advocate Brian Robinson, Natasha was shocked by the formerly apathetic response and failure to address Human Trafficking that takes place domestically, with research estimating that up to 300,000 American children are at risk each year to be trafficked within the borders of the United States alone.  The launch of her foundation, Redefining Refuge in 2010, has since sparked a contagious willingness from participants around the world who contribute to confronting and ultimately preventing Human Trafficking.  Natasha’s dream of opening a local Safe House for trafficked youth became a reality in 2013, and is the first home of its kind in the Tampa Bay area that provides a therapeutic safe haven for girls that rescued from this depravity. On this powerful and eye-opening episode, host Brian Klepacki sat down with Natasha & Brian. Everything, the good, the bad, and the ugly, was discussed about this fight against human-trafficking.\xa0  Listen in to this heartbreaking yet inspiring conversation that will compel you to take action today! This is one episode that will change lives. Natasha Nascimento Founder & Executive Director of Redefining Refuge  Brian Robinson Advocate of Anti-Trafficking \xa0 "In the US, less than 1% of sex trafficking cases of children are abduction cases.. so if you think it\'s looking like the movie Taken, it\'s not, it\'s absolutely not.  and  "The awareness is so much different today than it was just 5 years ago, than just 2 years ago, it\'s because of organizations like yours (CriticalBench) that are willing to have the discussion that the truth is now getting out." -Natasha Nascimento & Brian Robinson Time Stamps: 2:35 Familiarize oneself with Natasha’s narrative and how her advocacy about Human Trafficking started 4:20 Human Trafficking and its misconceptions 5:56 Organizations advocating against Human Trafficking, starting from mere two (2) to 7,000 organizations in the United States 7:00 How Brian got in to this fight against Human Trafficking 8:30 Why people avoid talking about this issue? 9:25 How Human Trafficking is similar to Sex Trafficking? 14:35 Sex Trafficking goes hand in hand with pornography 19:59 Statistics on Human Trafficking 22:30 Spot the signs of Human Trafficking 24:35 Human traffickers\' victims branded with barcode tattoos 28:12 Why is Florida such a hotspot for Human Trafficking? 31:22 Restoring hope with Redefining Refuge (About the Organization) 38:40 Challenges on Human Trafficking – Legislation, Resistance, Manpower, Funding 46:19 Parental responsibility on protecting their child from Human Trafficking 47:57 National Human Trafficking Hotline and other resources 49:55 Contribute to a Great Cause 56:35 Episode recap, and the role of social media in Human Trafficking \xa0 \xa0 Resources:  https://www.redefiningrefuge.org   https://www.facebook.com/RedefiningRefuge   Donate:  https://www.redefiningrefuge.org/donate/  \xa0 Other Resources:  http://www.floridadreamcenter.org   https://slaveryfootprint.org/   https://humantraffickinghotline.org/   \xa0  \xa0 Connect w/\xa0CriticalBench:\xa0  Youtube Facebook Instagram CriticalBench.com YouAreStrongByDesign.com    | We Believe that you are Strong By Design, Made in God\'s image to have a Strong Body, Mind & Spirit.

Whether it’s about your body, your smile, or even something that isn’t physical, most of us have tried to hide parts of ourselves we don’t like. But what happens when your insecurities are tied to the most visible part of you? Brian Turner is a vegan bodybuilder with a reach of almost half a million followers on YouTube and Instagram, but he wasn’t always so comfortable putting himself out there. Brian started dealing with acne at 15 and was soon suffering from four or five cysts on his face at a time. His painful experience with cystic acne first led Brian into a severe depression and he was eventually prescribed the powerful acne treatment drug, Accutane. Brian used fitness as an outlet and addressed his acne head-on, documenting and sharing his experience online. When he was not seeing any substantial results from high doses of Accutane, Brian looked to his eating habits. He saw great improvements after removing meat and dairy from his diet; he started eating more whole foods, and ultimately made the switch to veganism. Today, his skin is clear and he is stronger than ever. \xa0 “If you don’t have a passion, you miss out on a lot of life” - Brian Turner \xa0 If you like this episode Screenshot it Post it on your Instagram Story or Twitter Tag Nimai, Bianca, and Generation V!

The sale of prescription drugs has increased by over 300 percent since 1999. Almost three out of four overdoses are caused by prescription drugs which are more than heroin and cocaine overdoses combined. What's worse is that these drugs can be easier to obtain than the aforementioned illegal drugs. 6.8 million people who struggle with addiction also struggle with some sort of mental illness. Adam Sud, our guest today, had weighed over 320 pounds and was severely addicted to drugs and fast food. He was also afflicted with Type 2 Diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, and suicidal depression. His downward spiral culminated with an overdose as a result of a suicide attempt while he was alone in his filthy hoarder-like apartment. He checked into rehab and with the help of his parents and a plant-based diet, he began the journey that led to a remarkable recovery not only in reversing his chronic diseases and losing nearly 200 pounds but living a happy and healthy life of purpose. Now he is helping others discover how to find joy in owning their health and their well-being, and in developing self-love. Adam is now a diabetes and food addiction coach for masteringdiabetes.org.

Lindsey travels around the world inspiring women to get out of their own way and into action around their big ideas, and help them create the careers they’ve always dreamed of.

How did I stay balanced and continue to feel good in my body while galavanting across Italy, eating all the pasta all the gelato hanging out in a swimsuit all day? HOW did I balance everything? It used to feel like this impossible future far, far away! That is something where years ago, I didn’t know if I’d ever get to this point! That makes me so much more grateful, and humbled that I’m experiencing true balance, true self-love, really healthy body image, and I REALLy struggled to get here; I had to put in the deep work to get here-- How to approach eating on vacation, how to approach movement, how to keep a level head when all of these variables are out of your control!

I know you’re going to love how she leads this conversation as we get real and raw about my low points of sacrificing personal priorities for physical results, and prioritizing what I wanted to accomplish over how I wanted to FEEL for way too long.If you land on my page or a blurb from the podcast, you KNOW that I’m wildly passionate about teaching women HOW to find confidence within themselves, HOW to have a healthy lifestyle, and HOW to reach those physical goals from a place of true self love. But, what I love about switching chairs on episodes like these is that I get to take things ‘down to the studs’ (so to speak!) and remind you guys that I’ve built and placed self confidence on MANY different kinds of foundation over the years— some cracked and some not-so-sturdy, but eventually... some solid and stable! You KNOW I love goals, but when we place confidence in the achievement/approval (of ourselves OR others!) ..THAT’S where things crumble.As Jordan and I chat about today, confidence is not something you win by crossing a finish line. You can’t WIN confidence. But after some soul searching, time off, and basically an identity crisis, I found I was going about confidence and self love in allllll the wrong ways. We talk about feeling stuck, the limits we put on ourselves, why we attach labels, being multi passionate, feeding our brains with new choices and thoughts, and how you can sit with the ‘stuck’ in an empowering way instead of a wallowing way!If you’re feeling lost from a lack of direction or misplaced confidence, listen in for tangible tips and takeaways, because YOU are worthy of showing up for.SHOW NOTES: https://www.grindandbegratefulpodcast.com/episodes/FOLLOW MARIE: https://www.instagram.com/marieewold/FOLLOW JORDAN:\xa0https://www.instagram.com/jordanleedooley/LISTEN TO JORDAN'S INTERVIEW ON THE GRIND & BE GRATEFUL PODCAST:\xa0https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-049-how-to-make-your-everyday-extraordinary/id1392658806?i=1000438070545 | I LOVE that sustainability, plant-based eating, and mindfulness have all been hot topics of conversation lately because they ALL make our world a better place by making US and the planet healthier and happier.

He has been named “Coach of the Year” by United States Weightlifting and is a\xa0Level 5 senior International Weightlifting Coach. It was an unlikely friendship, however, that led Burgener to CrossFit. “Greg Glassman [the founder of CrossFit] calls me up,” recalls Burgener. “He asked if I was the guy holding courses for Olympic weightlifting and I said ‘yes.\' He said, ‘I’d like to bring my athletes down at this gym that I have in Santa Cruz, and I’d like for you to get them certified for USA Weightlifting.”This was 2005, the early years of CrossFit, but Olympic lifts were already at the core of the workout’s philosophy.The rest, as we say it, was history. CrossFit Weightlifting exploded.\xa0 (Read more here.)He is a graduate of Notre Dame and obtained his MS degree in Exercise Physiology from the University of Kentucky.

Am I happy that I went down a tenth of a pound? Not really. If there was a silver lining, in my weight update its that I was traveling for a week where I was stuck eating hotel food. I did take one step in planning and took some Advocare Meal Replacements with me and drank those for breakfast and skipped my lunch (attempting to do a slight version of Intermittent Fasting). With the news I received in this episode, I have new motivation. Withings BPM Connect Review Recently I added an Apple Watch to my tools of tracking my health along with My Fitness Pal, Sleep Cycle, and Streaks apps. As I started to investigate the Apple Health app and what tools worked primarily an Apple Watch (but also a Fitbit in case that is you). I really like my Withings Scale, and on their website, I see where they have a wireless blood pressure device called the Withings BPM Connect. It\'s around $95 and it\'s cordless and wireless. This is great for people who travel or want to store it in their desk (which is what I do). I take it out, and put my arm in the sleeve and press one button, and it takes my pressure and displays it on the unit (along with a hint if I have an issue or note) and automatically sends it to their app which then shares it with Apple health. It was so easy to use. High Blood Numbers When your doctor takes your blood pressure, the results are two numbers, with one number on top (systolic) and one on the bottom (diastolic), like a fraction. For example, 120/80 mm Hg. The top number refers to the amount of pressure in your arteries during the contraction of your heart muscle. This is called systolic pressure. The bottom number refers to your blood pressure when your heart muscle is between beats. This is called diastolic pressure. Both numbers are important in determining the state of your heart health.

As in a decade of information went up in smoke (thankfully most of the weight tracking is in my fitness pal. Tomorrow will be one week without so I ended up going and getting an Apple Watch Series 4 after hearing some friends say how cool they are. Apple Watch Features Really customizable screen Apple health seems to integrate with everything It does NOT grade how you sleep but there are apps that integrate with Apple health that do. I can\'t really tell as I can\'t login into my Fitbit account, but my Apple Watch shows that my resting energy was 2157 after one day. This would explain why if I eat 1900 calories or less I would lose weight. While Fitbit\'s are geared toward measuring calories in, activity and showing you the deficit, Apple Health is more overall health. My Withings scale integrates with myfitness pal and you can use my fitness pal to integrate with Apple health. Nonhealth things I love. I love that I can listen to my podcasts and have my phone in my pocket and skip and fast forward etc on my watch. I love that I don\'t have to sync with my phone. It operates on its own. I realize the Fitbit Charge is $150 and the Apple Watch is close to $500 so its not a fair comparison. It would be better to compare it to the Fitbit Ionic which is $250. In the end, I\'m happy with my Apple watch. My wallet is lighter which makes it easy to walk. Built-in Accountability Partner In the Apple Activity App where you can set goals for calories burned, exercise minutes, and how many times you stand a day, you can share that with contacts on your phone.

Freshly Food - Good, Quick Food There are so many food delivery services, and I\'ve tried some but being a finicky eater (no mushrooms, no peppers, nothing too spicy) it\'s hard to find one that works for me.\xa0 I was very impressed with the food from Freshly. I loved the Tukey meatballs with Zoodles, and other dishes. The peppercorn steak was really good for coming out of a microwave.\xa0 Unlike other delivery services where there is some food prep, this is like someone delivering gourmet TV dinners. You pop \'em in the microwave and three minutes later you\'re eating good food.\xa0 I will say there were some inconsistencies. The first time I ordered the Turkey meatballs they were amazing. The second time, they were great. This week I felt like the chef drop some pepper in the mix as it made my eyes water it was so spicey. I even checked on the website and this dish is not supposed to be spicy so I don\'t know what happened.\xa0 Time or Money I mentioned in a previous episode I threw together some things into a bowl with a nod towards chipotle. It was\xa0 one cup of brown rice 3-5 oz of cubed chicken Grape tomatoes a sprinkling of mozzarella cheese. Shredded iceberg lettuces A dash of salad dressing.\xa0 When I did the math it costs me $4.72 per serving and takes me three minutes to make (and that includes cubing the chicken and slicing the tomatoes in half).\xa0 The price of a freshly meal is $12.50 a meal. The time you are saving is shopping and putting away the groceries.\xa0 They make it really easy to start and cancel (although they really try to get you to stay). They have gluten-free, and vegetarian meals as well. Most of their meals are between 450-700 calories. The meals I purchased were pretty heavy with salt. They were shipped well, and nothing was ever in danger. They pack them well to stay cold.\xa0 Check them out at www.logicallos.com/freshly Join the Logical Losers and Support the Show Through Patreon See www.logicallosers.com | Kayla Cox is the author of the book, "The Laid Back Guide To Intermittent Fasting: How I Lost Over 80 Pounds and Kept It Off Eating Whatever I Wanted" she has 30 thousand subscribers but the reason I\'m excited to have her there is she has lost 80 lbs AND KEPT IT OFF.\xa0 She is married and has three kids, and currently is on the road in her RV and today she shares  What inspired her to "do something"\xa0 How she finds the time to exercise How she selected six miles as the goal for each day Why you can not be perfect and still get results She doesn\'t count calories, carbs, and has a cheat day How she worked her way up to eating one meal a day What she does in maintenance mode  More From Kayla Cox Her website is www.sixmilestosupper.com Check out her book The Laid Back Guide To Intermittent Fasting Her website has courses, her blog, resources, YouTube and more Support The Show Become a logical loser and join our support group where we all lose together see www.logicallosers.com | I\'m looking into the 131 Method by Challenge Johnson. A member of the Logical Losers pointing it out and said it looked interesting. I took a peak on my kindle, and then purchases the Audio Book on Audible. You can get any book on audible for free by going to www.logicalloss.com/freebook This lead to me taking the 131 Method Course I liked that she points out her own struggles as she ages. I liked that she points out how awful parts of the fitness industry is. She talks about a time when she was getting ready to do an exercise video and the producer/director (I can\'t remember which) asked her to drop a few pounds. I love that she mentions that bad advice that is out there and how many people were spouting advice based on data that may have been funded by people who swayed the results. This did make me wonder what she was basing her exercise videos on, but none the less I admired her honesty. I liked that she mentions in the 131 Method that you don\'t have to give up one food type. How to Spot a Bad Diet Plan In doing this podcast over the years I\'ve noticed that almost all diet plans use the same verbiage or have similar characteristics. Here are some examples:  DIETS DON\'T WORK - and here is how we are different PHASE ONE WILL HAVE YOUR DROPPING POUNDS QUICKLY - so you tell all your friends TASY RECIPES THAT LEAVE YOU FEELING FULL - that for me include avocado and green pepper (two things I\'m not a fan of ) in everything. HAVE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS TIED TO THE DIET - a course, a recipe book, etc. The diet is the bait to hook you into other products.  So it\'s too soon to tell if the 131 Method is legit or a Fluke To Be Something You Have to DO SOMETHING Why am I taking the 131 Method course? Because what I\'m doing now isn\'t working. I consider it an investment in myself (and its a LOT cheaper than the days I went to Slimgenics).\xa0 What If Your Body Was a Kid I was listening to the book Backstage Pass by Paul Stanley (the lead singer of Kiss) and he makes a great statement about divorce and not talking bad about your spouse. Do you hate your ex more than you love your child?\xa0 Which is more the love and desire to protect your child or your ill feelings for your ex?\xa0 I think everyone would scream "My Child is the most important thing in my life!" Then maybe we should treat our body like it was one of our kids. We wouldn\'t feed our kids things that are horrible (but we do to ourselves).\xa0 Where Did All This New Inspiration Come From? I have been passive about my weight loss efforts for the last few months and my results have shown this as I\'ve gained weight. So what did I do to get reignited?\xa0 I joined the 131 Method course and I thought, "If I\'m going to do this, I\'m GOING TO DO THIS." Step one to take a selfie of yourself. This will be a "before picture." There is something about the word "Before" that caught me. It had me picturing myself in the future. It had me planting my flag saying "NO MORE - THIS IS IT."\xa0 I took a picture of myself from the front and a profile picture which showed my gut.\xa0 I\'m Turning Into a Walrus When I saw the picture of the back I almost gasped. My posture is horrible, and I have lost almost all definition in my back. As a paperboy, I had strong legs and a strong back. As a grocery bagger, I had strong legs and a strong back. I was never "ripped" but I had a "V" and now my back looked like I was turning into a Walrus.\xa0 That\'s all I needed. So today instead of coming home and getting on the computer I went to a local park (maybe 10 minutes away) and hiked in the woods (and got super close to a deer).\xa0 I have always said "the heaviest I\'ve ever been was 225, and now I was up to 227. If I want to BE something I have to DO something.\xa0 Mentioned In This Show 131 Method Course 131 Book Free Audio Book SUPPORT THE SHOW BECOME A LOGICAL LOSER Go to www.logicallosers.com and get the show ad-free and join our private facebook group. | Fun in the Utah Sun I have a pretty bad fear of heights, and I have sun poisoning. However with a little planning, and some help from a friend I was able to go hiking in Utah. It was a lot of fun, and the scenery was beautiful.\xa0\xa0 I had some great conversation with my guide Elikgiute from the Travel Gluten Free Podcast. I asked the question,\xa0 "If someone was making a movie of your life, what would this time in your life be called? for me I had a childhood, Jr High was awful. Then I had the 20\'s and alcohol. I had the 30s being a musician, and being married. My forties were marriage #2. Now that I\'m in my fifites I\'ve had some great experiences, but when I looked around some of my actions seem to indicate that I may be roping myself off from life and support.\xa0 If I don\'t clean my apartment than people can\'t come over. If people don\'t come over I\'m more likely to feel alone.\xa0 If I take on more and more projects, then I don\'t have time for family and any kind of support (or in my case exercise and eating right).\xa0 So taking a step back and not looking at YOU as a person, but instead trying to take a\xa0logical look at your actions you might say "those are not the steps that will lead to me achieving my goal."\xa0 | A quick bonus episode to invite you to come on the show, and to let you know (for the Summer) I\'m going to an "every other week" schedule as I spend about four hours putting together an episode, and it doesn\'t make much sense to do a weight loss show where I\'m not losing weight.\xa0 So temporarily I\'ll be publishing every other week and taking some of those four hours and exercising.\xa0 | \xa0 We Don\'t Need No Uber! I took my car in for a quick brake job and instead of taking and Uber or Calling a Friend I walked back home, and later back to get my car. This was repeated twice resulting in me walking almost 19 thousand steps in one day. Why? Cause it was going to take 20 minutes for Uber to come get me (As I wasn\'t near a city). Better Me App Uses Humiliation The Better Me App is available on Apple\xa0and Android BetterMe is an app for people who will try anything to better themselves. The app uses public humiliation to help keep your appointments, to achieve your goals, and to jump out of bed in the mornings. Features include an alarm clock, goal tracking, and GPS check-ins system to keep your recurring appointments. If you fail, each of these features will humiliate you by posting a message on your Facebook wall. GPS Check-ins: First input the address and time of your gym, class, or work schedule. Then the app will use GPS to check if you arrived at your destination on time. If not, then you will be shamed on Facebook! Goals: Goals are announced on Facebook. It asks your friends to hold you accountable. The app will later ask if you have achieved your goal and if not then you will be shamed on Facebook. Alarm: Snooze this alarm clock and receiving a shaming immediately. How Fast Do I Normal Walk I installed the  Walkmeter app to find out. This app is free, but they sure make the free version annoying. Lots of ads. I mean TONS. So I used it enough to figure out I walk about 3.1 miles an hour if I\'m walking around the neighborhood. Why did I want to know this? Because (for me) that is the slowest I should walk on a treadmill. I now know that 4.0 miles an hour is a way to "Push" me a little. It is available on Apple or Android Stretching 101  Increased flexibility and joint range of motion Improved circulation Better posture Stress relief Enhanced coordination  How to Get Into Stretching? Warm up first ( walking, pumping arm, low intensity) Hold each stretch for at least 30 seconds Don\'t Bounce: Focus on a Pain-Free Stretch (pain means you\'ve gone too far) Relax and breathe Stretch both Sides If you are working out, stretch before and after Need examples? Morning Stretches Lower Back BiOptimizers Probiotics Eat a Steak I\'ve talked about Probiotics in the past, and I hear about the P3-OM strand and how it\xa0really does what a Probiotic is supposed to do (help with digestion). They have supplements to protect yourself from Gluten,\xa0 terminate Acid Reflux, eliminate Constipation, and get rid of Amino Acids (along with Probiotics) Check it out at www.logicalloss.com/bio Mentioned In This Episode Very Well Fit Very Well Health Things Can Only Get Better by Howard Jones Brene Brown on Shame (Get Her Audio Book "Daring Greatly" For Free) Become a Logical Loser Get the show ad-free and join a safe and caring community Go to www.logicallosers.com | In examining myself, it doesn\'t take much to notice that my problem is staying consistent. I lose weight, and I find weight. So I went digging to find out how to keep goals in front of you that  keep you moving toward your goal don\'t bite off too much and leave you\'re discouraged don\'t leave you bored to where you quit  \xa0 My Goal This Month is 1 LB a Week I started April at 223 lbs, and I want to be 219 at the end. As I write this on 4/18 I am .57 lbs behind my target weight. Like many goals, I came out of the gate and was ahead of schedule but then got lazy and now I\'m struggling. The good news is by being able to see how I was ahead/behind it inspires me to stay on track.\xa0 Now if for whatever reason, I can get achieve my goal of 1 lb a week, then maybe next month I will drop to .75lbs a week. Without making the goal so easy that you are bored, you want it to push you. For me, it is something I focus on from the moment I wake up. It requires my attention. For you, you may be able to lose 1 lb a week in your sleep. That\'s fine, and this is key. Find a goal that works for you.\xa0 Try Not to Repeat Bad Behaviors In the book Atomic Habits (finally finished the book) he mentions having goals and having daily strategies and he said something that is inspiring me. You\'re not going to be perfect, but when you see on one day you don\'t achieve a goal, do your best to avoid missing two days in a row.\xa0 In the past I\'ve mentioned I use an app called Way of Life and I also tried HabitShare (which is very similar but you can share your habits with an accountability partner) that I have specified meal goals and activity goals. I could see where my lunch meal was consistently going over calories. Without starving myself I reduced the portion size and now I\'m back on goal. I\'m Testing The Streaks I just heard about a new app that I have not tried called "Streaks"\xa0 STREAKS. The to-do list that helps you form good habits. Apple Design Award winner. Track up to twelve tasks you want to complete each day. Your goal is to build a streak of consecutive days. * Streaks automatically knows when you complete tasks linked to the Health app * Streaks reminds you. It\'s $4.99 and only works on iOs/Apple (including the watch). If you are primarily using it to track exercise they have a specific app for that at https://streaksworkout.com/ Never Break The Chain These streaks app can help you see just how good or bad you are doing (you do need the discipline to enter the data, but that\'s the good news you can track as little or as much info as you want. For me, when I have to put in that I didn\'t meet my daily calorie goals, the next day (trying to avoid having two in a row) I feel inspired.\xa0 Do What Works For You Find your sweet spot where you have challenging goals that keep you motivated, and most importantly you can sustain in the long run. You are not going to burn yourself out, and you\'re not going to bore yourself. There is only one person who knows you, your heart, and your dedication. If you start off with a goal that you can\'t reach, be sure to add the word yet to that statement. Lower the bar\xa0slightly and come up with a goal you can reach. Do that goal consistently, and then raise the bar.\xa0 Become a Logical Loser!

Dr. Anthony Jay thinks you can get really specific by looking at your DNA and analyzing what your genes say. Dr. Anthony Jay started out as a “virus designer”. He would make viruses in a lab to help transport DNA into certain cells. He now works at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota\xa0researching stem cells, epigenetics, and infrared light and is the President and CEO of AJ Consulting Company.\xa0In addition to leading AJCCo, Dr. Jay is a bestselling author of\xa0Estrogeneration. He also does DNA consulting on the side, so that’s how this conversation with Kris started. Kris got his genetics testing done through 23 and Me and Dr. Jay took a look and came back with some recommendations based on Kris’s specific genes. A little background: We have 25,000 genes. Most of our genes are great, but Dr. Jay is not looking for good genes. He’s trying to highlight the bad genes. We all have two copies of DNA in our bodies. IF you have a bad version of a gene from your mother and a bad gene from your father then your gene it is considered a ++. If you have a bad version of a gene from your mother and a good version from your dad, then you have a -+ gene. If you have good versions from both parents of that gene then you have a\xa0 - - . The most powerful genetic issues are related to the ++ genes (two bad versions of a gene). When looking at your genetics you want to focus on the genes that have a ++ next to them. *DISCLAIMER: The following recommendations are based on Kris’s specific DNA results and not meant to be taken as gospel for each and every person. To learn more about getting your own specific recommendations please reach out to Dr. Jay. \xa0 \xa0 Timestamps 1:37 Recap of what Kris and Dr. Jay talked about in Episode 40 Episode 40 - Impact of Plastic on Our Hormones with Dr. Anthony Jay:  https://www.krisgethin.com/podcast/plastic-and-hormones Why is BPA bad for you?

So on this episode of Living Well with MS, we are fortunate to have as our special guest one of the most qualified guides through the MS research labyrinth,  Professor Gavin Giovannoni. \xa0 Professor Giovannoni is an academic neurologist based at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London. His current research is focused on Epstein Barr virus as a possible cause of multiple sclerosis, MS-related neurodegeneration, biomarker discovery and validation, and MS clinical outcomes. In his spare time when he is not busy pursuing new frontiers in MS research, Professor Giovannoni is an avid reader, blogger, runner, gardener, husband, father, dog-owner, cook and wine and food lover. \xa0 Questions in this episode include: \xa0  What got you interested in specializing in MS? In what ways have you seen MS clinical and research objectives shifting over the past decade? Do you see lifestyle modification as playing an increasing role in patient care? Why are  lifestyle factors so critical in managing autoimmune conditions such as MS? Has generally accepted clinical practice for MS care been slow to adopt some of the best practices in terms of integrating lifestyle modification into mainstream care that we’ve seen in heart disease, diabetes and certain forms of cancer? If so, why? What are the most promising research frontiers in MS today? What can we expect to see as possible outcomes of today’s MS research in the next 10-20 years? What’s the most  important advice would you give today to people newly diagnosed with MS?  \xa0 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. Our next episode will feature  Dr. Aaron Boster, an Ohio-based board-certified clinical neuroimmunologist specializing in MS. Dr. Boster will discuss how to navigate the array of medication choices available for managing the symptoms of MS, and how to make the right choices. Be sure to tune in! | Many experts believe that vitamin D is a key regulator of the incidence and severity of MS, and this is one of the reasons why ensuring sufficient intake of this critical natural resource is one of the pillars of the Overcoming MS (OMS) 7-Step Recovery Program. So, it’s timely that this episode of Living Well with MS picks the topic apart with a guest well-versed in his own right on the topic, Dr. Conor Kerley. \xa0 Conor was diagnosed with MS at the age of 15 and fully expected to be forced to curtail his active lifestyle. He was surprised at the lack of focus on diet and lifestyle in his medical consultations, so he undertook his own research, eventually finding OMS and making the necessary adjustments to his diet and lifestyle that have kept him active, symptom-free and relapse-free to this day. Inspired by his experiences, he went on to study human nutrition and dietetics, and received his PhD from University College Dublin in 2016. You can read Conor’s full bio here. \xa0 Questions about vitamin D include: \xa0  Why is Vitamin D important in general? Why is Vitamin D especially important if you have MS? Could MS cause low vitamin D rather than the other way around? How do you measure your own Vitamin D level? What’s a healthy level of Vitamin D to have? What type of vitamin D should I take? How about getting Vitamin D naturally, from the sun? How do I do that? How do you balance the benefits of getting Vitamin D from the sun with the risks of too much UV exposure? My doctor said to take 1000 IU per week because my level is at 100 nmol. Should I follow that advice? Is vitamin D safe to take? Can you overdo it? Anything else we should know about Vitamin D? Any interesting facts, side benefits or risks?  \xa0 Questions about other supplements include: \xa0  Are there any other supplements someone with MS should consider taking? Rather than taking Vitamin D, flaxseed oil and Vitamin B12 separately, should I just take a multivitamin tablet? What are the pros and cons of other supplements? Let’s go through a short list and tell me what you think:  Cannabis CBD oil High dose biotin Vitamin K2 Magnesium   And last but not least, everyone’s favorite and perhaps controversial topic: cannabis. What are your thoughts on its benefits and drawback for people with MS?  \xa0 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. Our next episode is quite the hot ticket, because Geoff will be discussing research priorities in MS with one of the foremost experts in the field,  Professor Gavin Giovannoni, Chair of Neurology, Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London and the Department of Neurology, Barts and The London NHS Trust. The topic and guest promise one of the most insightful episodes yet! | Most people, regardless of whether or not they have MS, may think running a marathon is, simply put, crazy. While exercise is an important part of the Overcoming MS (OMS) 7-Step Recovery Program, we make no claim to making everyone (or anyone) a marathon runner. Many people with MS will have symptoms that preclude them from running long distances, or indeed running at all. But inspiration is open to all, and this episode’s special guest, Alex Tsirigotis, is someone who not only runs, but has pushed his body to his limits by regularly running marathons. And the fact that he has MS is just a footnote in his story. \xa0 About Alex Tsirigotis: \xa0 Alex lives in North London with his wife and two children. He was a keen footballer (that’s soccer for our US audience), playing three times a week, when in 2012 he suffered a knee injury which kept him out of action for 6 months. During his rehabilitation he began to experience visual impairments when engaging in light physical activity. Following several medical referrals and tests, he eventually received a diagnosis of Relapsing-remitting MS in 2013. Discovering OMS shortly after diagnosis, Alex has embraced all aspects of the lifestyle for the past six years and despite not being able to continue playing football and contact sports, he developed a love for running and cycling and has successfully completed a London to Paris cycle, several marathons and an ultra-marathon, something his neurologist told him would not be possible in the early days of his diagnosis. \xa0 In his interview, Alex mentions his OMS Athens video and the OMS Strava Club. \xa0 Questions include: \xa0  How about your experience with MS? When were you diagnosed? How did you find out that you had MS? What changes did that mean for your life? What were your symptoms? When did you find out about OMS and how did you learn about it? How long was it after you started following OMS that you started to come into yourself? When did you start to see noticeable improvements? Any tips on implementing the OMS program? Tell us a little about your fascination with marathon running. How does it feel to run a marathon? Why do you do it? When you’re doing endurance exercise, do you notice any differences between yourself and other runners? Do you have any long-term side effects from running marathons? What, in your opinion, is the single most important piece of advice you have for anyone contemplating starting the OMS program?  \xa0 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. In our next episode, Geoff interviews Dr. Conor Kerley and dives into the world of vitamin D and other supplements. This is a key topic in MS and overall health that you won’t want to miss! | Meditation is an important facet of the Overcoming MS (OMS) 7-Step Recovery Program, but many people find it hard to work it into their daily lives, while others think that it might be too “out there” for their more practical sensibilities. We are very pleased to have Dr. Craig Hassed as our guest on this episode of Living Well with MS to demystify the practice of meditation and provide very sound reasons for why you should consider its wondrous stress-relieving effects as reason enough to consider trying it. Dr. Hassed, an expert on mindfulness-based stress reduction, will also provide some common sense tips about how to successfully work meditation into your daily life. \xa0 Dr. Hassed works at the Department of General Practice and is coordinator of mindfulness programs at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. He is regularly invited to speak and run courses in Australia and overseas in health, professional and educational contexts. He is the author of 11 books, was the founding president of the Australian Teachers of Meditation Association and is a regular media commentator. \xa0 You can learn more about Dr. Hassed’s professional background here. \xa0 Questions include: \xa0  Is mindfulness really scientific? What happens to the body under stress? Is there a difference between long-term stress and short-term stress? Should you get professional help as well as mindfulness training if you experience anxiety or depression? Does religious faith reduce stress? Should we keep a journal? Is mindfulness the same as meditation? Is it necessary to follow guided meditations?  \xa0 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. In our next installment, join Geoff as he interviews Alex Tsirigotis on how he has conquered running numerous marathons in spite of having MS. | You can probably feel your heart racing a bit, and that’s even before you’ve listened to episode 6 of the Living Well with MS podcast, which is all about getting and staying fit. In this episode, host Geoff Allix dons his proverbial trainers (or sneakers, depending on where in the world you’re wearing athletic shoes) to discuss the importance of implementing a balanced fitness regimen when you have MS. Joining Geoff is Véronique Gauthier-Simmons, originally from France and now residing in Portugal, is an OMS facilitator and qualified yoga instructor and yoga therapist. Véronique was diagnosed with MS at the age of 34, but through the Overcoming MS (OMS) 7-Step Recovery Program and her love of exercise found a way to make staying fit a meaningful part of her life. Since exercise is such a key pillar of the OMS approach, Véronique now helps others do the same, always hewing to her personal motto, “stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right!” \xa0 You can learn more about Véronique’s professional background  here. \xa0 Questions include: \xa0  How does you decide which exercise – running, swimming, biking, weights, yoga – is right for you? If you’re not fully mobile, what kind of exercises can you do? Should one stay within their comfort zone, or push their boundaries? Is it better to watch exercise videos or take a fitness class?  \xa0 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. In our next installment, join Geoff as he speaks with mindfulness expert Assoc. Professor Craig Hassed on stress relief and working meditation into your daily routine. | Welcome to episode 5 of the Living Well with MS podcast. This episode is a bit of a departure from our usual interview format, as our host Geoff Allix packs his mic and travels to the stunning city of Edinburgh, Scotland to attend a powerful one-day event, Recovering from MS: Wishful Thinking or Realistic Optimism? This OMS event took place on Saturday June 8, 2019, with featured guest Professor George Jelinek, founder of the OMS program. Among the 400+ attendees joining George were numerous OMS facilitators, neurologists and other health professionals, and well as hundreds of people from around the world who are on the OMS program.

They continue discussing diet as a key pillar of the Overcoming MS (OMS) 7-Step Recovery Program, and how to integrate the OMS diet dos and don’ts into one’s daily routine. \xa0 You can learn more about Sam’s professional background here. \xa0 Questions include: \xa0  What are the basic rules of the OMS diet? Do you just end up eating salad? Can I eat at restaurants? What do you do about cooking for the holidays? What about chicken breast? Is it that bad? Any tips to make cooking easier?  \xa0 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. In our next installment, join Geoff for a very special “live” episode, as he captures spontaneous interviews with Prof. George Jelinek, OMS staff and OMSers themselves from the Recovering from MS event in Edinburgh, Scotland to be held on June 8, 2019. | Welcome to episode 3 of the Living Well with MS podcast. In this episode, host Geoff Allix gets out his knife and fork in a savory two-part interview with nutritionist Sam Josephs, BA (Hons), DipBCNH, mBANT, CNHC Registered. As you can tell by all the acronyms after Sam’s name, she is a highly experienced nutritionist who works in North London. Sam’s husband was diagnosed with MS in 2002, and has been doing quite well following the Overcoming MS (OMS) 7-Step Recovery Program. Since diet is such a key pillar of the OMS approach, Sam has become an expert in how to integrate the OMS diet dos and don’ts into one’s daily routine. \xa0 You can learn more about Sam’s professional background here. And given the importance of the topic and the extent of the tasty questions Geoff had in store for Sam, this episode will be broadcast in two parts. \xa0 \xa0 Questions include: \xa0  What are the basic rules of the OMS diet? Do you just end up eating salad? Can I eat at restaurants? What do you do about cooking for the holidays? What about chicken breast? Is it that bad?   Any tips to make cooking easier?  \xa0 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. In our next installment, join us for part two of our nourishing chat with Sam Josephs on the OMS diet in a nutshell. | Welcome to episode 2 of the Living Well with MS podcast.

In our next installment, we’ll talk to Sam Josephs to discuss the OMS diet in a nutshell. | Welcome to the inaugural episode of the Living Well with MS podcast. In this podcast, we are going to take a journey together to explore how extensive scientific research is illuminating new ways to help people with MS live better and healthier lives through changes made to their diets and lifestyles. This evidence-based approach to MS management is reflected in the Overcoming MS (OMS) 7-Step Recovery Program. \xa0 In this episode, we speak with Professor George Jelinek, the founder of OMS. You can learn more about his illustrious medical and scientific research career here. We talk about Professor Jelinek’s incredible journey, from losing his mother to MS to his own diagnosis to discovering the science behind recovering from MS, and how he shaped his pioneering work to help people with MS all over the world live healthier lives. We ask Professor Jelinek some key questions to gain his insights on Overcoming MS: \xa0  Why did you step down as head of the Neuro-Epidemiology Unit at the University of Melbourne, and what will you be doing next? Can you give us an overview of OMS? Is OMS essentially just a diet? Meditationis part of the OMS 7-Step Recovery Program, but it doesn’t sound very scientific. Is there any science behind it? Most other MS protocols outside of health services tell you not to medicate, but OMS doesn’t; why is that? Do you think  lifestyle factorswill enter into the mainstream treatment? Any prevention tips for people with MS who have children?  \xa0 Subscribe to this podcast above and never miss an episode.

I like to start my morning routine with a visualization. Because it helps me focus on what I want to accomplish for the day… and I get so much more done!\xa0 Remember, your thoughts create our actions...your actions create your habits… our habits create our character… and your character becomes your destiny.\xa0 Where your focus goes, energy flows.\xa0 For more, visit www.kathysmith.com/podcast. \xa0 | CBD is popping up nearly everywhere. It’s in oils, lotion, toothpaste, bath bombs, shampoo, and even ice cream. It’s definitely moved from the experimental fringes and into the mainstream.\xa0 Today, let’s dive into how CBD is different than THC - and how hemp is different than marijuana. There's a lot of info in today's episode and, luckily, today’s guest is here to sort things out. Naturopathic doctor Dr. Melissa Gallagher has a YouTube channel that delves into the science, the safety, and the benefits of CBD. With her hundreds of thousands of followers, she’s helping to set the record straight on a subject that can be a bit complicated. So get ready for CBD 101 the beginner's course! Dr. Gallagher's Endocannibinoid Deficiency Quiz:\xa0 https://naturalhealthresources.com/cbd/edsquiz.html \xa0 | Let me ask a question. Do you feel like you’re at a point in life where you feel like something has to shift...it could be changing a job, losing weight, moving to a new state, improving or ending a relationship? If you’re frustrated or confused about how to take action and get started in that process, then today’s show with Julie Weiss is for you. Julie wrote the book,  The Miles and Trials Of A Marathon Goddess. Imagine having the determination to run 52 marathons in 52 weeks...it seems impossible. But that’s exactly what Julie did. In her book, she opens up her soul and talks about the tough stuff that happened in her life...the dark side, the demons, the bad choices she made, and when she finally hit bottom and felt completely overwhelmed, she decided to finally reclaim her life. And she did it one step at a time...or should I say, 26.2 miles at a time. And along the way she raised over half a million dollars for a cause near and dear to her heart. Julie’s powerful message of determination will give you the courage to step outside your comfort zone and make the changes you want. If you’re ready to spread your wings and make things happen, listen up! | Today, we're talking about vitamins. It might have started with chewable Flintstones that your mom gave you as a kid, then in college it was vitamin infused water, and now there is an edgier and somewhat controversial method called vitamin vaping. Although the delivery systems might have changed through the years, this idea of supplementing your diet with vitamins has been something that’s been part of our lifestyle since the time we were little ones. So the question is: Do we even need to take vitamins? We know that taking vitamins and minerals is never going to justify less-than-healthy eating habits. But, there’s growing evidence that the right supplements can improve your health and vitality, including maintaining bone density and muscle mass, improving brain function and mental clarity, balancing hormones and rejuvenating skin, hair and nails. One trip down the vitamin aisle and you’re bombarded with hundreds of options, and some with outrageous claims. That can cause decision fatigue and opting out of adding any of the supplements to your cart. So, if your head starts to spin when you start to talk about vitamins, welcome to the club! But that’s all about to change because today’s guest Shawn Wells is here to clarify the confusion and simplify a conversation that can tend to be very complicated. Shawn has a divergent background. He is a Registered Dietitian with a decade of experience as a Chief Clinical Dietitian in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. He is also a Certified Sports Nutritionist and has worked with celebrity clients and professional athletes. All of this experience combined with his extensive background in formulating supplements for big companies converge to make him the world’s greatest formulator. | Aging comes subtly. Sometimes, the changes might feel like joint stiffness in your hip or shoulder, or sometimes the signs are stooping posture, increasing belly fat and loss of muscle mass... those changes are easy to see and feel. Yet other changes are completely hidden. I hear over and over again from my friends and listeners that after their annual bone-density scan, they’ve been diagnosed with thinning bones. It’s expected that by 2020, half of all American men and women over the age of 50 will have, or will be at risk of developing osteoporosis of the hip... and even more will be at risk of developing it elsewhere. What if I told you that you can increase your bone density and actually reverse bone loss with a technique that requires only 10 minutes a week. Are you listening now? It seems unbelievable! Make sure you listen to this show all the way to the end, because today’s guest Dr. John Jaquish has developed a device that’s placed in over 300 clinics worldwide. These clinics, called Osteostrong, focus on osteogenic loading (which basically means putting strain on the bone that applies enough impact or pressure to stimulate new bone growth). It has now helped over 30,000 individuals with their bone health. We have a lot to cover and we're lucky to have Dr. Jaquish here to help us. He is an inventor, author, and scientist, and stumbled upon his life’s mission to promote bone health after his mother was diagnosed with osteoporosis. He is currently advancing osteogenic loading research and speaking worldwide, as well as developing other biotechnology devices and products that will aid in the advanced health and wellbeing of people all around the world. For more, visit www.kathysmith.com/podcast. |      Imagine being able to take cells and use them to cure all kinds of ailments - from diabetes to heart disease to macular degeneration. All across the world, scientists have begun clinical trials to try and do just that, by making use of the incredible power and versatility of stem cells. Today’s guest, Dr. Amy Killen, is at the forefront of this movement with her revolutionary work with cosmetic stem cells to create youthful, healthy, glowing skin...also \xa0to stimulate hair to move from the inactive “resting” phase to the active “growing” phase….. and she also works with sexual revitalization for both men and women. Stem cells help heal tissues. Whenever you have some kind of injury, stem cells target those damaged tissues and release a rich mixture of growth factors to trigger the healing. With age, stem cells start to poop out, and you don’t heal as quickly. And this happens to every tissue in our body. Trying to boost the impact of your own stem cells has captured the attention of the medical community. Dr. Killen talks with us about the latest research and advancements in the field. Dr. Amy Killen works at Docere Medical\xa0in Park City, Utah, where along with Dr. Harry Adelson they have built a reputation for regenerative optimization medicine.

With all the conflicting information, it can get muddled and confusing, and often times emotional.  To help clear up some of the confusion is Dr. Joel Kahn, a cardiologist who has seen first-hand the devastating effects of your diet on your heart and on your health. He’s also the founder of the Kahn Center for Cardiac Longevity in Michigan. He’s authored hundreds of articles on heart disease, and, he happens to be the owner of GreenSpace Café, advertised as plant-based and pure, where health tastes amazing.  In addition, Dr. Kahn is the author of five books, including  The Whole Heart Solution and his newest offering,  The Plant-Based Solution.

If you listened to our last conversation, you know that he went from Fit to Fat to Fit! He actually was in killer shape, then gained 70 pounds in 6 months on purpose, and lost it again in 6 months...just to get a better understanding of the weight loss process. And, he wrote about it in his New York Times best-selling book,  Fit2Fat2Fit. In Drew’s latest book, Complete Keto, he gets PRACTICAL about how to live a ketogenic lifestyle that works with your daily routine.\xa0 The ketogenic diet is the world's fastest-growing diet, and I have been getting so many questions about it on social media, so today's episode dives into the why, how, and the whats. This is where Drew comes in. He has a solution that goes way beyond willpower, offering a program that's based on a deep understanding of the challenges in starting a keto program, and sticking with a keto program so you can enjoy the benefits for life. For show notes, visit www.kathysmith.com/podcast. \xa0 | If you’re like most people, you have some complaints about your memory.\xa0 Perhaps you walked into a room and forgot why you were there, or you can’t think of a name of an acquaintance even though you met her half a dozen times...or you see a movie, and two weeks later you can’t remember the title, or parts of the plot.\xa0 It can be a very frustrating experience! \xa0 With more than 41 million Americans over the age of 65 in the United States, the question becomes how much (or, perhaps, what type) of memory loss is to be expected as one gets older and what should trigger a visit to the doctor. \xa0 On today’s show, we will delve into What’s normal, what’s not, and what to do about it. Our guest is Dr. Andrew Budson, the author of  Seven Steps to Managing Your Memory. And he’s here today to help us address key concerns about memory loss. Dr. Budson is a professor of neurology at Boston University, and lecturer of neurology at Harvard Medical school. His career combines education, research, and clinical care for those with memory disorders.\xa0 \xa0 For show notes, visit www.kathysmith.com/podcast. \xa0 | The ketogenic diet is the world's fastest growing diet - and with good reason. When practiced correctly, it burns fat, reduces inflammation, fights cancer, balances hormones and gut bacteria, improves neurological diseases, and even increases lifespan. Unfortunately, many people are still confused about several of the key factors that are crucial to the diet's success... and that sets them up for frustration and failure. In his new book,  Keto Diet, Dr. Josh Axe sets the record straight on how to start a ketogenic diet the right way...for your body and your lifestyle. He joins Kathy to discuss the book and ways to implement the keto diet for yourself!

[jbox color="grey" radius ="2"] The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron Today\'s Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry. Today\'s question is around plant-based versus whey-based proteins and the big question is when should you use a plant-based protein versus a whey-based protein? Tim Caron: More people than you realize actually have an intolerance or an allergy towards whey protein. Whey is a very fast digesting protein, so when you\'re looking at something that quickly digests, you may potentially have some adverse reactions. Signs and symptoms including distended gut, some skin irritation, inflamed joints, potentially loose stools, excessive flatulence, acute nausea. These might be all indications that you\'re not tolerating your whey protein as well as you should. Now, we need to supplement something in terms of getting increased protein levels, so a plant-based protein, usually kind of a combination of rice, hemp, and pea from really high quality sources, organic, and things that actually blend to make a complete protein. Plant based protein might be a really good alternative that doesn\'t have as much digestive issues as a whey protein. [/jbox] Get value from the podcast?

In this week\'s session, I had a great question from our community member\xa0Anthony who wanted me to open up about how I train and achieve work-life balance. Here\'s the truth, life balance (or work-life balance) is a myth. There\'s no such thing. But this is actually good when you understand how it works and how it actually makes your life better. This was something I discovered years ago and now I\'m sharing this with you. I\'ll tell you the secrets to how I\'ve sustained my excitement and passion for training for decades and how I manage this through life\'s challenges and stresses.

Today\'s question is can you explain the different whey sources on the market? For example, isolate, concentrate, hydrolysate, can you explain what they mean and how they\'re different? Tim Caron: Isolate is a whey protein extracting out all the fat and just leaving the form of protein in terms of whey. Hydrolysate is basically an isolate that goes through a heating process, breaks down the peptides in to more individual amino acids and removes excess amounts of casein and sugar, specifically lactose. In the case of whey, they bio-availability and the rapid absorption is really, really important, which makes a big difference in terms of post-workout amino acid pool. We want to have one that\'s a little more broken down. The caveat to that is having an ability to digest whey and if it is really quick digesting and you have digestive issues, you\'re going to have a hard time with a very fast breaking down whey protein, like a hydrolysate. So, altering that potentially with a plant-based protein might be something you need to look into based off your ability to digest these really quick digesting proteins.

Today\'s question is how much protein can be consumed and utilized by the body at one time and what can alter protein consumption? Tim Caron: It depends a lot on your ability to digest proteins and your overall body mass. More muscle mass usually leads to more overall calories or individual macronutrients, in general, in specific to protein. So, when we take protein in abundance, this has a high satiety level and satiety means that we\'re going to get filled really fast. It\'s really difficult to determine an exact amount, but typically the bigger you are and the better you digest proteins, the more you can do that, which leads to the quality of the protein. You don\'t need as much when you have a higher quality of protein relative to eating a lower quality of protein mixed with some other things that might affect your actual satiety levels - like high sugar, maybe really processed foods, savory, salty foods. Getting higher quality protein, in conjunction with higher quality foods, helps your ability to digest and assimilate proteins at a higher level. [/jbox] Get value from the podcast?

Today\'s question is when does it make sense to use a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) product? What does the research say about this? Tim Caron: BCAA\'s, in regards to what\'s actually in them, is a combination of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Reasons why we want to have those three individually is largely due to getting leucine in our body. Leucine\'s an amino acid that\'s used during training, but it also stimulates the protein synthesis pathways. Now, in terms of what research is saying, a lot of it\'s actually leaning towards more essential amino acids and having amino acids that your body\'s not capable of producing kind of covers a lot more bases. If we\'re looking at getting our leucine levels to stimulate one energy production during training, as well as protein synthesis, having a lot more coverage in terms of all the essential amino acids is definitely where research is leaning towards and showing more promise. BCAA\'s still hold weight and can still be effective, just more research is leaning towards using essential amino acids. [/jbox] Get value from the podcast?

[jbox color="grey" radius ="2"] The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron Today\'s Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry. Now, we\'ve talked about the NSF certification before and the question today is when it comes to supplements, when do we need to look at with this certification (the NSF certification)? Tim Caron: If you\'re an athlete you should always be conscientious of what you\'re putting in your body. If you\'re someone who\'s competing you should always have a high standard in what you put in your body. In general, if you\'re investing in supplements you should always have the highest possible standard of what you\'re putting in your body, that makes a huge difference. And, when you\'re really evaluating your process of training and nutrition and supplements opting for the highest quality caliber of things to do and having a third party\xa0(NSF is the most widely respected independent certification organization today) that that actually can comes in and help you make that decision. It makes that process just a little bit easier, as well as a little clearer, on what you need to do. [/jbox] Get value from the podcast? Then, please take a minute to review the show.

[jbox color="grey" radius ="2"] The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron Today\'s Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry. Tim, today\'s question is what\'s most important to look for in protein supplements and how do we sort through so many different options that are available today? Tim Caron: Ingredient list. Look at the back of the label and actually seeing what\'s in there. Can you pronounce the ingredients? Do they look familiar? Are these things that you feel like something that wouldn\'t be hazardous to your body? I think there\'s a lot of intuition that should be used when you\'re looking at any supplements. The quality of the ingredients matters and as we dissect each one of these proteins, they have to have these products that have a shelf life and also have some sort of ability to break down and taste good when you\'re mixing it. So, looking at the back of the label and making sure it\'s grass-fed, making sure it\'s organic, making sure you can enunciate each one of those names makes a big difference in terms of how your body\'s going to react to that. Looking at the nutrition label should be paramount in most people\'s process of evaluating everything. Make that your first and foremost priority and you should be okay.

Today\'s question is do we really need to supplement with protein sources like protein powders and why? Tim Caron: We wish we lived in a perfect world where the reality is we can get all of our protein needs met by food. The unfortunate thing is we don\'t. People are busy, athletes are on the go, if your training goal is always to be in a net positive in regards to your amino acid pool, but it\'s also really hard to get a full complete meal after your workout. Now when we\'re looking at post-workout, a really big benefit in terms of recovery is having bio-availability and actual proteins that digest quickly. Things like whey protein and plant-based protein, they actually digest quicker and in terms of getting your amino acid pool replenished to be in net positive in terms of overall protein, so you can build muscle. Protein supplements do make a big impact. If we\'re really trying to get the maximum out of our training, we need to make sure that we\'re having the recovery aspect dialed in afterwards. And just having a convenient, useful tool to get that protein need met, that does make it necessary. [/jbox] Get value from the podcast? Then, please take a minute to review the show.

The question today is about the NSF certification. What is important to know about the NSF certification on product labels and can you please explain what it is? Tim Caron: The NSF is a third-party group that evaluates products and how we\'re looking at supplements. A lot of it\'s unregulated so we need to have some sort of intervention in regards to saying what the ingredients are, saying that they actually have them, someone following through with them, and why that\'s important for you as a customer. Potentially you\'re an athlete, potentially you\'re someone who\'s under the guidelines of testing and seeing if you\'re actually under other substances that are not conducive to a competitive and equal playing field. NSF comes in and meets us in the middle in providing a service that makes companies hold themselves to a higher standard and the process to go through that is fairly rigorous. Having that piece of mind, knowing that a company went that extra step to actually really follow through and have integrity to make sure that they\'re providing really high quality products that actually say what they mean, that makes a big difference. As an athlete, as someone who\'s competitive, or just wants a higher quality, NSF is something you should really look for in your supplements. [/jbox] Get value from the podcast?

In the Inside Mike's Mind Segment, I give my top 3 ways to help remotivate yourself when you feel like you have lost the urge to train.\xa0 In my research review I share an interesting study on how eating or not eating breakfast may effect your strength performance, plus some key takeaways for you. Finally in my Coach's Corner, I have on Spartan Pro Heather Gollnick.\xa0 Heather is a 5 time Ironman Champion turn elite OCR athlete.\xa0 Healther shares some of the differences in her trainer from her triathlon days to now, how she keeps in prime shape after years of highly competive training.\xa0 She shares what her program looks like in season versus off season, plus how she tapers for an upcoming race.

In this episode I discuss a common topic that I hear discussed on obstacle specific training.\xa0 How often and should you even train on obstacles as part of your training?\xa0 I give my recommendation on this hot topic. In my research review I look at new research on static stretching.\xa0 Is static stretching really bad to do before your workout?\xa0 What about during your workout?\xa0 This study looks at what static stretching does when you stretch between sets during strength training.\xa0 The answer may surprise you. Finally, in our main discussion, I go in to assessing versus guessing.\xa0 Do you know your weakest areas?\xa0 How do you know they are the weakest?\xa0 Have you ever measured them?\xa0 If you aren't assessing certain things, then you are completely guessing in your training.\xa0 In this podcast I discuss of few simple things you can do to measure you baseline and see if your training is really making a difference or not.\xa0 We review power, strength, muscular endurance, grip strength, and cardiorespiratory edurance. Full shownotes: www.ocrunderground.com/episode-63 \xa0 | The OCR Underground Show provides you with everything you need to maximize your training for your best race.\xa0 In this episode I share some great insight on how you can have a smarter training plan.\xa0 Hoping to redeem my Big Bear race, I am off to race the Spartan Sprint in Minnesota.\xa0 At least there is no snow in the forecast.\xa0\xa0 In the Inside Mike's Mind segment of the show, I explain the truth about cramping during a race.\xa0 Is it as simple as dehydration or electrolyte loss?\xa0 Most likely not.\xa0 Tune in to see how you can stop cramping before they start.\xa0\xa0 We have a great race recap with Jordan Boyd from Australia.\xa0 He gives us a great recap of the 24Hr OCR Enduro Championships.\xa0\xa0 In my research review, I discuss why you need to disperse your training intensity and the value of low intensity training.\xa0\xa0 And we have a great announcement about a new sponsor of the show.\xa0 Venga CBD is our newest partner.\xa0 I orignial interview their CEO Jay O'hare.\xa0 After chatting with him about the benefits of CBD and how it can help the endurance athlete specifically, I decided to give it a try.\xa0 I was incredibly impressed with their products and I am excited to have them in support of the show.\xa0\xa0 In this episodes interview I chat with Jay and gives a great summary of what CBD is and how it may benefit you in your endurance performance.\xa0\xa0 All this plus much more! \xa0 Full shownotes at:\xa0 www.ocrunderground.com/episode-62 \xa0 \xa0 | Well one thing is for sure, that you just don't know what to expect with OCR's.\xa0 Recently the Spartan Race at Big Bear was no exception.\xa0 With rare snow fall in May in SoCal, we so some last minute race cancelations and modified courses.\xa0\xa0 Overall Spartan did a great job handling this unfortunately situation, despite the fact of making us hit the dunk wall twice in the Sprint.\xa0 In this episode I give a race day recap of Big Bear, plus talk about some key takeaways on how you can better plan for the unexpected.\xa0\xa0 In my research review I share a really interesting study that looked at improving VO2 max using standard heart rate prescrition versus a more customized approach.\xa0 Even more intreging with this study was how they view responders versus nonresponders to training.\xa0\xa0 Finally, in my coach's corner interview I have on award winning author Alex Hutchinson.\xa0 Alex actually started out as a physicist, with a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge then a few years as a postdoctoral researcher with the U.S. National Security Agency, working on quantum computing and nanomechanics. During that time, he competed as a middle- and long-distance runner for the Canadian national team, mostly as a miler but also dabbling in cross-country and even a bit of mountain running. Alex's primary focus in writing is the science of endurance and fitness.\xa0 He is a contributing editor for Outside for the Sweat Science colums.\xa0 He is also a regular contributor to The Globe and Mail, Canadian Running Magazine, Popular Mechanics, the New York Times, and Runner's World.\xa0 Alex is on to discuss some of the findings and research he found when writing his latest book Endure: Mind, Body, and the Curiously Elastic Limits of Human Performance.\xa0 He discuss the different factors and theories behind what truly limits our performance and how we probably are not reaching our full potential.\xa0\xa0 Alex leaves you with some great insight on how you can remove the self brake your body has built in and push through to new limits.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 Full shownotes:\xa0 www.ocrunderground.com/episode-61 \xa0 | Well this episode is just loaded with info so let's get right down to it.\xa0 Are you ready for an Ultra Beast?\xa0 If so I have the plan for you.\xa0 I talk about the 4 month training plan that I created to help clients take on the Ultra Beast and earn that belt buckle.\xa0 Click here to learn more. In the Inside Mike's Mind Segment I talk about altitude training.\xa0 Yes I know we have discussed this before, but with races like Big Bear coming up I still see tons of questions come up about racing at altitude.\xa0 In this episode I go in detail on the 3 main things you need to be concerned with. I have on special return guest CJ Wagner with Gym Jones and Misfit Strength on to give a race recap on the first Honors Series Spartan Race in San Antonio. In my research review I share a simple trick that will help you jump high and further based on quite a few research studies. And finally I do a deep dive into core training.\xa0 Specifically what the core is, the 3 levels of your core, how you can train each one, and how it can effect your movement and performance.\xa0 Don't worry we aren't just going to be talking about planks in this one. \xa0 Full Shownotes:\xa0 www.ocrunderground.com/episode-60 \xa0 | What was harder the Spartan Sprint in Vegas or waking up Sunday after a race and night out on the strip?\xa0 It is a close call but I think I will take running a race no matter how hard over waking up early with a hangover. This past weekend we had a blast racing and spending a fun weekend in Vegas.\xa0 It started out with a fun visit to Maddam Tussaud's Wax Museum.\xa0 You can see from the pic above we had a blast with this.\xa0 One thing I absolutely love about doing all of these races is getting to travel with my wife and have fantastic experiences with her. In this podcast we do cover the Spartan Race out in Vegas, but also I share some insight into Pain versus Source of Pain.\xa0 When your knee is bugging you should really be focusing on how to fix your knee or should ou be more worried about what caused the knee issue in the first place? In my research review, I discuss a great study on recovery.\xa0 Specifically active versus passive recovery.\xa0 Doesn't it matter which you do?\xa0 Well if you want to improve endurance and power then it absolutely does.\xa0 Listen in to learn more. And finally in my coach's interview I have on a very special secret guest.\xa0 They were a little hesitant to be recording for the podcast so I am going to leave it as a mystery for you.\xa0 You will just have to listen in to find out who it was. But we discuss our post race thoughts on the Vegas Sprint, how to find time for workouts when life gets in the way, some of our favorite 20 minute workouts, how to get started when you just don't feel like working out, and much more. \xa0 For complete shownotes visit:\xa0 www.ocrunderground.com/episode-59 \xa0 | In episode 58 we cover a variety of topics to get you on track for your next OCR.\xa0 It's the start of the year and the question of New Year's Resolutions always comes up.\xa0 Are they a good thing or a waste of time?\xa0 In this episode I share why you absolutely should set a resolution.\xa0 But you need to do it the right way. In the Inside Mike's Mind segment, I discuss one of my favorite topics, Strength Training.\xa0 While most are probably performing some type of strenght training in their program, there are a number of aspects that must be included for a complete strength program.\xa0 See if you are missing any of these vital elements. In the Research Review, I discuss the importance of identifying asymmetries.\xa0 I review a study that looked how differences in left and right quadricep strength was used to predict knee injuries.\xa0 This is an incredibly important topic to understand and implement in your training plan. Finally in our Coaches Corner, I have on Coach Q.\xa0 I met Coach Q a few years back when we were going through the SGX certification.\xa0 He has a wealth of knowledge and experience in a varitey of different fitness avenues.\xa0 Q followed a similar path that many find themselves on.\xa0 Starting as a skinny guy he turned to body building.\xa0 Then started to see the damage that excessive training could do to the body he started to focus on better movement quality and better overall health. He uses his own experience and knowledge to help others learn to treat their body's better.\xa0 We get into his story plus some of the common practices he is using with his clients for improving mobility, rehab, and training. \xa0 Full shownotes:\xa0 www.ocrunderground.com/episode-58 \xa0 | Well the 2019 season is here and Spartan has revealed new obstacles.\xa0 This is obviously a nice change of pace since 2018 saw little updates in the races. Overall I enjoyed the change and the new obstacles that were at the Chino Hill race.\xa0 They brought on new challenges for different levels of racers and it will be fun thinking of new ways to train for these obstacles. In this episode I will give a breakdown of some of the updates on older obstacles we saw as well as what to expect for 2019.\xa0 This year we should see more of the Helix, the beater, the 8 foot box, and crawl tubes.\xa0 I give a breakdown of each and some ideas on how to train for them. \xa0 Full show notes:\xa0 www.ocrunderground.com/special-episode \xa0 | With 2018 coming to an end it is time to finish the year strong.\xa0 Have you looked back at how your OCR training and racing went in 2018.\xa0 Are you satisfied?\xa0 If you are reading this you probably are never satisfied and are always looking for even the slightest competitive edge. This weeks episode is just what you need.\xa0 We announce a brand new partner of the OCR Underground Show this week.\xa0 Also, I share what it takes to change.\xa0 It is easy to set goals in January, but most will fail.\xa0 The key is not how you set the goal, but the action you take the reach that goal.\xa0 In order to be successful there are key factors you need to consider.\xa0 Without these you will never hit goals you are setting. In my research review, I talk about training while sick.\xa0 The winter is full of colds and flus, which can clearly interfere with your training.\xa0 But should you workout when you are sick?\xa0 We talk about when it might be ok and how to go about it. Finally, in our coach interview I have on return guest Dan Shamburg with results fitness.\xa0 Dan dives deep into junk miles.\xa0 This is a term we often here with running and that we should avoid them.\xa0 Dan reveals what junk miles really are and ways you can adapt your training to get the most out of it. \xa0 Full shownotes:\xa0 www.ocrunderground.com/episode-57 \xa0 \xa0 | The OCR Underground Show Episode 56 Show Notes We are back with another episode to help you fast track your OCR training for your next race.\xa0 With the races in 2018 winding down it is time to start planning ahead for the 2019 season.\xa0 Now is the time to start focusing on your game plan.\xa0\xa0 In this episode, to help with your off season training, I discuss different ways to make your workouts harder.\xa0 Sounds like an easy thing to do.\xa0 But when I ask most people how they progress their exercise routine, the usual go to response is add more weight.\xa0 While getting strong is a valuable part of your training, it shouldn't be the only emphasis on progressing.\xa0 If the only way you make an exercise hard is by adding more weight, you are missing out on a ton of opportunities to improve your racing.\xa0\xa0 In our research review, we talk about foam rolling.\xa0 This is a topic that has been discussed previously on the show.\xa0 I don't think there is much argument that is against foam rolling but there are right and wrong ways to do it.\xa0 In this segment I discuss how much pressure you should be using.\xa0 Are you pushing too hard or too soft?\xa0 We will dive into this topic and explain what the true purpose of foam rolling is.\xa0\xa0 Finally in our coach's corner, I have back on Jono Blodgett.\xa0 Jono just finished up an awesome season.\xa0 He ended up winning a few Spartan Races in the Age group Division, including the World Championships in Tahoe.\xa0 Jono has been doing some really cool things in his program out in Hawaii, so I wanted to get him on and discuss what lead to his success this year, how he dealt with cold and altitude, plus how he plans on keeping it up for next year.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 Full shownotes:\xa0 www.ocrunderground.com/episode-56 \xa0", 'chan_desc': 'Discover what the top Spartan SGX coaches from around the country are doing to help their clients dominate their obstacle races.

In this episode I talk with Ann Louise Gittleman, one of the world’s foremost experts in functional and integrative medicine and Linda’s mentor, joins us to discuss her book, Radical Metabolism, and give us tips and tricks to help us lose weight easier, fuel our bodies better, and even help slow losers kick their metabolism into higher gear. Ann Louise has written over 30 books on diet and nutrition and has spent 40 years in this industry. She shares advice on weight loss, healthy diet, what fats we need, and how to balance your lifestyle and still lose weight.  Questions I asked:  Why did you write this newest book? Why do you need to balance omega 3 and omega 6? Why hemp seed oil? Is it true that sourdough bread is a probiotic? What is CLA, and why is it important? What is the difference between CLA & GLA? Why is bile important to us? Is lemon going to help with bile? How can you deal with inflammation? Any tips to deal with bloating? Why should people buy your book?  \xa0 Topics Discussed:  Coffee can actually be a healing beverage. High-Fat Diets. Why people are slow losers. Hemp seed oil, and hemp seed protein. Curing dermatitis with hemp seed oil. Omega 6 keeps you tight and toned. CLA is basically “snake oil” for your body. How Ann Louise stays young and glowing. Why we need to reduce our iron intake. Get more bitters in your diet. Why Radial Metabolism can help people.  \xa0 Quotes from the show:  “There is so much new research out there, and women who are slow losers, or over the age of 40 aren’t losing like they used to.” @chtwellness @SisterhoodSweat “When you start adding hemp seed oil, you get healthy skin, beautiful hair, and you start losing weight.” @chtwellness @SisterhoodSweat “You\'ve gotta get bitters back in your diet. Bitters are better for digestion, for metabolism, and for overall weight loss.” @algittleman @SisterhoodSweat “I have to set the record straight and re-write the rules of nutrition.” @algittleman @SisterhoodSweat “The book, Radical Metabolism, is great for slow losers, people over 40. Everything I\'ve gleaned from my 40 years on the front lines is included in this book.” @algittleman\xa0 @SisterhoodSweat “Hemp Hemp Hooray. 1-2 Tablespoons each day. Move over coconut oil.” @algittleman @SisterhoodSweat  How you can stay in touch with Ann Louise:  https://annlouise.com https://www.facebook.com/annlouisegittleman/ https://www.youtube.com/user/DrAnnLouise Get the new Book, Radical Metabolism: https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Metabolism/dp/B07G7DY737/ Check out her other books: https://annlouise.com/books/  \xa0 How you can stay in touch with Linda:  Website Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest YouTube SoundCloud  \xa0 "Proud Sponsors of the Sisterhood of S.W.E.A.T"  Essential Formulas  \xa0 My daily energy stems from mushrooms... mushroom coffee that is!

It’s not about a quick fix for the brain, but it’s more about a life change in order to turn back time on your brain. \xa0 Questions I asked:  Why do we get brain fog in the afternoon? What can we do to limit our body burden? How can we get the toxins out of our home? What are the warning signs of inflammation in the brain? Does salmon and good fats help your brain?

Traditionally, “older” (30–40) has been seen as better, with experience and knowledge helping tri veterans make it to the podium. Lucy Charles-Barclay is pushing back.

Tony is a trainer and author who was one of the first to take his thoughts online, creating an early bridge between in-gym experience and the web\'s fitness community. Back around 2010, there weren’t a ton of places to turn to when it came to learning about the ins and outs of strength training online. But Tony’s name was one that popped up everywhere, a testament to his ability to take real-world experience and translate that into the written word.Tony’s known for a lot of things: He co-founded Cressey Sports Performance in 2007, has trained countless elite athletes in pro sports, and remains one of the most prolific writers in the entire world of strength training.In the days before Instagram, Tony helped mold the blueprint of the trainer-author, paving the way for some of today’s biggest online fitness influencers. He’s someone who excels at combining his real-world coaching experience with the latest evidence and research.Today, Tony still dedicates a huge chunk of his time to training clients in-person at his Massachusetts studio. He’s still a prolific writer, with an active web presence at TonyGentilcore.com, and is also an in-demand speaker for fitness events around the globe.\xa0In this episode of The BarBend Podcast, I chat with Tony about what’s changed as strength training becomes increasingly mainstream, along with what too many athletes and coaches are STILL getting wrong when it comes to getting stronger.

After a quick intro Jake dives right into some of the best practices he has seen to actually make people faster. This includes him discussing the roles of motor control, which has become sexy of late, and affecting the force/velocity profile. This leads Jake down the rabbit hole of the role of the force/velocity profile, and how it can be impactful in the physical preparation of their athletes. We then discuss some guidelines for evaluating athletes in these areas and where he has seen errors come from trying to get numbers too early. Next, Jake shares with us some things that he has observed with working with staffs all over the world, and what has made some groups more successful than others. Jake then shares with us some advice on looking at force plate information, including what he feels may be a bit over rated. We finish off with a little self reflection and talking “if I knew then what I know know.” Make sure you give him a follow at @coolhandjakegs on twitter and instagram.

With all their products providing evidence-based solutions to performance professionals so they can get the right information, for the right decision, at the right time. Make sure to go check out all their great products at: www.valdperformance.comA huge take home from this summers edition of The Seminar for me was the idea of talking about what the athlete can do, as opposed to what they can’t do that Sam Gardner referenced in how they program for their athletes. This has changed my outlook on our “retrun to play” programming from the outset of an injury. We can always find something the athlete CAN do, and something they CAN work on to get better. That doesn’t me that we should just throw something hard at them to “make them work”, but can be something that can be focused on a specific aspect of their training that they can improve upon to increase their abilities in other areas of performance.

How efficient is your movement? That’s the most important thing in any sports skill.”“It can’t be a KPI if that doesn’t effect their actual competitive exercise.”“Eventually, more and more strength work does not transfer. It just doesn’t transfer. We’re wasting time, and energy. These athlete’s have a finite amount of adaptation energy. So we can’t just keep blowing energy trying to get a bigger front squat, trying to get a bigger deadlift.” This episode of The Podcast is brought to you by Exxentric, the makers of the kBox and kPulley.

The Weston A Price Foundation is held in high regard by global nutritional leaders, often considered the definitive source of traditional nutritional wisdom. Those who attempt to return full health and human potential back to western societies usually cite the work of this foundation.The foundation showcases and extends the brilliant one-of-a-kind and unrepeatable work of of Weston A Price, a dentist, who travelled the world observing the contrast in diet and health of indigenous tribes when compared to modern western cultures. He performed observational studies, nutritional testing, took thousands of pictures of indigenous people, and hypothesised that the departure from traditional nutritional principles was the leading cause to the health issues we were (and are ) seeing. He is most famous for documenting his findings in the his book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.In this interview, Sally introduces us to the key principles of a nutrient dense diet through describing Weston A Price’s observations, talking about the myriad of issues in the modern diet and guidelines, and placing a positive emphasis on our need to embrace saturated fat.Most of all, Sally argues strongly for the need to take full responsibility as adults on the health of our children, and just how important a nutrient-dense diet is to their development from preconception through to a young adult. This is a heart warming and convincing plea, backed up with logic and science.Enjoy!\xa0\xa0\xa0Where to find\xa0Sally Fallon Morell and her work :▪︎ The Foundation: Westonaprice.org\xa0& beginners tour video▪︎ Sally’s Blog:\xa0http://nourishingtraditions.com▪︎ Sally’s Books - Nourishing Traditions, Nourishing Fatsand Nourishing Traditions (Baby & Child Care)▪︎ Social: @sallyfallonmorelland @westonaprice▪︎ Raw Milk Website & Database -\xa0www.realmilk.com▪︎ Healthy4Life 100 page Brochure▪︎ Weston A Price Main Brochure▪︎ Weston A.

Today, we’re speaking all things OXALATES, with specialist Elliot Overton.\xa0Why should you care? Is this quackery BS? I think you should listen in and decide for yourself…Oxalate is a mild metabolic toxin found in most plants to varying degrees. Unlike other phytonutrients or molecules like gluten and lectins, Oxalates cannot be broken down by the body or detoxified by the liver. It’s eliminated… or accumulated.Oxalates are found in high volume in many of our so-called superfoods of today - including Spinach, Cocoa, Beetroot, Sweet Potatoes and Almonds. Whilst these foods and many others have a great reputation for their health benefits, it turns out we’ve been omitting one major downside to copious all-year-round consumption of these foods - Oxalates!\xa0In this in-depth two parter (Ep. #91 & #92), nutritionist and functional medical practitioner Elliot Overton walks us through all you need to know about this insidious yet anonymous bad actor in ‘healthy diets’. Elliot lays down a lot of science, to help logically justify the reason for concern when it comes to Oxalate Poisoning and Oxalate Dumping.Elliot provides a potential answer to those who are suffering with a random collections of symptoms that ebb and flow. He provides a new way to look at food, issues with your body and mind, and new things you can try for yourself with diet and health management.\xa0\xa0Here’s what we discuss across both Episodes:\xa0🔸 Elliot’s journey - from long-term vegetarian and GI issues to ancestral living, nutritionist and functional medicine practitioner🔸\xa0We’re overdosing on Superfoods & terrible Green Smoothies - many “superfoods” are very high in Oxalate🔸\xa0Oxalate history and background - 150 year old knowledge. What are oxalates, issues they cause, how the body handles them, and interesting science🔸\xa0Factors that predispose you to greater Oxalate absorption - Diet choices, microbiota, gut dysbiosis, environmental, genetic\xa0🔸\xa0Where Oxalate can get lodged - not just kidney stones! List of organs, tissues and biochemical disturbances🔸\xa0Why Oxalates are a big issue today, compared to the past? - the reasons that have made this an issue the previously we could manage without concern🔸\xa0Conditions associated with high levels of Oxalate - \xa0Usually, a combinations of these unassociated symptoms that flare.🔸\xa0Oxalate is not an allergy or sensitivity - The difference between immediate reactions and long-term toxic accumulation🔸\xa0High Oxalate Foods - a run down of the worst offenders, with approximate values\xa0🔸\xa0What is Oxalate Dumping? - What is happening internally, how long will it last, and how to identify?🔸\xa0Typical collection of symptoms of Oxalate Dumping - What you may feel, randomly and cyclically.\xa0🔸\xa0Steve’s ongoing experience of Oxalate Dumping - Steve goes through the unexplained, weird and coincidental last two months since dropping Oxalate\xa0🔸\xa0How to Manage Oxalate Dumping - Nutrition strategies, supplementation strategies, and other approaches that can lessen dumping symptoms🔸\xa0What is a healthy level of daily Oxalate? - Elliot provides the safe range, with caveats, as well as justifying why everyone should be mindful of Oxalate consumption\xa0\xa0Where to find ELLIOT Overton:▪︎\xa0Youtube Channel - EONutrition▪︎\xa0Facebook Page - EONutrition▪︎\xa0Website & contact - www.eonutrition.co.uk\xa0Show References:▪︎\xa0Sally Norton - leading expert and insightful website▪︎\xa0Lost Seasonality Paper & Overconsumption os Plants - insightful Oxalate paper by Sally Norton▪︎\xa0http://lowoxalate.info\xa0- Susan Owen’s informative Oxalate website▪︎\xa0Susan Owens\xa0- Performed over 2 decades of research to date on Oxalate and effects on autism and other conditions▪︎\xa0Trying Low Oxalates (TLO) Facebook Community - 22K members.

Michelle is back on the mics to represent women and mothers - a skill I’ve yet to master!\xa0Joking aside, it’s often the case on podcasts like AdapNation that they can become male-dominated in voice, thoughts and in some cases male-centric topics. I like to think what we talk about is accessible to everyone, with little male-bias, but it does absolutely miss the mark with adequately expressing female perspectives.Today, Michelle joins us to give an update on where things are with her nutritionally and physically. She’s in a really good place right now with food, nutrition, health and appreciation for her body, but that absolutely hasn’t always been the case.\xa0\xa0So, we dig into her historical issues, and how she is now being driven by intuitive wellbeing. We also talk about feeding our kids to thrive, and how Michelle has navigated their transition to a way of eating that they love, and as a result are flourishing across all aspects of their development.\xa0Here’s what we discuss:🔸Michelle’s current Way of Eating - What she eats, doesn’t eat, guiding\xa0principles,\xa0flexibility and\xa0listening to her body🔸The Freedom of Intuitive Eating\xa0- Michelle’s journey of mistakes, knowledge and now being guided by intuition. Is she a canary in the coal mine?\xa0🔸Michelle’s Previous Food & Eating Issues\xa0- Good habits gone bad. Unhealthy food relationships. Active punishment. Walking through her nutritional and health timeline.🔸The Mental & Physical Benefits of Fasting Sporadically\xa0- What Michelle gets from intuitive and non-scheduled fasting practices🔸The Turning Point for Michelle\xa0- Coming to terms with lifestyle induced Hypothyroidism and Shingles🔸From Calorie and Volume Restriction… to Nutrient Density!\xa0- What drove the switch to prioritising essential nutrients, and mental challenges along the way🔸Michelle’s Current Relationship with Weighing Scales, Physique and Calorie Counting\xa0- Turning unhealthy practices into valuable tools whilst embracing her natural shape🔸The Need to Question and not Blindly Follow the Guidelines\xa0- In spite of going against many dietary recommendations, she’s healthy, feeling good and with perfect blood work🔸Feeding Our Kids to Thrive\xa0- Michelle’s justifications on their diet, challenging what ‘kids like and should eat’, what they eat, and building in hedonistic flexibility🔸How we Managed Their Transition to a Whole Foods ‘Clean Diet’\xa0- The process and emotions, the why, the benefits and the decisions we make when eating out at social events🔸Giving Kids the Choice to make the right choice for Their Bodies\xa0- How they are listening to their bodies. Self-regulation and rationing. Being involved in the kitchen. Taking ownership for feeling rough after making the wrong decisions\xa0I’ll leave you with the wise words of our youngest.

Saturday was race day!\xa0 The day started clear and cool.\xa0 As the day went on, the sun came out.\xa0 It was a great day to be on the trails.\xa0 I felt God’s love shining done. Those trails were muddy though!\xa0 There were places where when you stepped in the mud your foot just sunk, but most of the mud was the kind where you step, and your foot just slides sideways.\xa0 That kind of mud really tests your balance.\xa0 I was very glad I had been training with hiking poles and had them with me.\xa0 I’m not sure how some of the others made it up the hills especially without poles.\xa0 Those hills are steep enough without mud – with the mud it takes your whole body to climb.\xa0 All the slip and sliding really added a whole new element.\xa0 It hadn’t been that muddy all summer while I had been training. Talking about climbing – there was 8,871 feet of climb. Since we start and end at the same place, that means we had that much downhill too.\xa0 However, there was one section where we dropped about 900 ft in just over a tenth of a mile.\xa0 It was towards the later part of the race and my feet were not happy holding the rest of my body back at that point. I was so appreciative to have an amazing crew following me. \xa0My daughter, husband, mom, and dad followed me all day long.\xa0 They allowed me to drop my poles on the road segments and meant that I only had to carry my water bladder on the longer trail segments.\xa0 Not having to worry about having that backpack the whole time allowed me to relax my shoulders and back, use my arms to gain some speed on the road sections, and just created a much more enjoyable experience.\xa0 Plus, I didn’t have to carry food or refill my water myself.\xa0 Yeah team! My A goal was 9 hours – the time the race director stated was the cutoff, my B goal was to finish.\xa0 Before the race, the director said that because of the mud the cutoff time would be extended.\xa0 In some ways I wish I hadn’t known that so that I would have pushed myself harder. When I was about 4 miles in, a racer came up behind me, super-fast.\xa0 He was a marathon runner that had started a half hour after me.\xa0 Soon enough the rest of the marathoners passed me.\xa0 When I was about 8 miles in, he passed me again on his way back.\xa0 THAT made me feel really slow!\xa0 I didn’t see any of the other runners on their way back in.\xa0 However, about mile 18 another runner came up behind me.\xa0 He was doing the 50k but had taken a wrong turn and added about 4 ½ miles to his course.\xa0 At about mile 23, where there was a fuel station, I saw him sitting there.\xa0 He decided not to finish.\xa0 I encouraged him to continue, but he was out of his fuel and was going to take the SAG wagon back to the finish. My family ended up taking him back instead and had a really nice conversation with him. The first 2/3rd’s of the race I was just about perfect with the times – just behind the 6-hour mark.\xa0 However, the mud in the last quarter of the race kicked my butt and the steep downhills sealed the deal.\xa0 During the last two miles I just kept talking to myself to get myself through it.\xa0 I climbed what I thought was the final hill (where I could see the finish line).\xa0 However, there were three more down and up and more mud.\xa0 By the last mile or so I decided to throw the time goals away and just focus on finishing.\xa0 My toes were done.\xa0 Every step that had the slightest downhill was so painful.\xa0 My legs and the rest of my body felt fine, but you really need your toes for balance.\xa0 My entire being was focused on the finish.\xa0 The property we were on was beautiful.\xa0 I was gingerly trekking along and realized the trail had just ended at a rock outcropping.\xa0 It was gorgeous with a slight trickle waterfall, but I was very confused – had I missed a turn.\xa0 I stopped and looked around and couldn’t figure out how I missed the flags directing me along the trail.\xa0 They were right there about two feet from me. I continued up and down the hills on the lovely trail wondering where the finish line was.\xa0 Finally, I came down a hill and could see the mowed trail on the other side of the creek headed back to the finish line.\xa0 I continued walking along the bank of the creek when the trail completely stopped.\xa0 I froze.\xa0 This creek was about ten feet across and two and a half feet deep.\xa0 I didn’t see anyway around it.\xa0 Was I going to come this far and not make it to the end?\xa0 My feet hurt so bad I couldn’t even consider taking my shoes off because there was no way I would get them back on. \xa0I had been there about thirty seconds, trying to figure out what to do and if I was really supposed to wade across the creek when a young girl came down the trail on the other side.\xa0 I asked her if I was really supposed to cross the creek here.\xa0 She happily and with lots of energy said yep! I sat down on a log and slowly pulled off my shoes and socks.\xa0 I then hobbled over to the edge of the creek and realized there wasn’t any way I could cross the creek with my shoes in my hands and holding on to my hiking poles.\xa0 I knew I needed the poles to get across the creek because there was no way I could balance that well on my sore feet.\xa0 I looked at the girl and asked her if she would mind carrying my shoes across the creek for me.\xa0 She gladly plunged right into the water and came over and got my shoes for me.\xa0 I got across the creek and realized I really wasn’t going to get my shoes back on and asked her if she would mind carrying them for me.\xa0 At this point, I knew the finish was less than a quarter mile away.\xa0 She happily said sure and ran ahead announcing to everyone – that is my family, the race director, and a few of the other people that had put on the race – that a runner was coming. I continued down the mowed path until I was about 500 feet from the finish.\xa0 At that point, I dropped the poles and ran the rest of the way to the finish.\xa0 In bare feet with my pants rolled up to my knees. I had done it.\xa0 9 hours and 55 minutes, but I finished and except for the blisters on my feet, felt really good, not sore at all. Two days later as I record this, I have gone for a four-mile walk, probably the last nice day we will have this year.\xa0 Everything feels good except for my baby toe on my right foot.\xa0 Thanks for joining me.\xa0 Be sure to check our show notes for links to inspiration items and …\xa0 don\'t forget to stop and smell the roses. 50k Race website:\xa0https://www.cheyennecreekcamp.net/ Park where race is held:\xa0http://kickapoovalley.wi.gov/Home Find us on Social Media Facebook fb.me/sensorystrides Twitter @sensorystrides | "A walk in nature walks the soul back home."\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0- Andy Rooney Final long run (well kind of) before tapering. 22 miles on the trails.\xa0 Instead of using the same trails I’ve been on all summer, I decided to hit some of the trails at the park which I haven’t been on before.\xa0 Last weekend my family went to the park to find some geocaches we hadn’t found yet.\xa0 It was a good activity to keep the younger group busy and allow the older group to get out in nature and do an activity we enjoy – while getting some additional caches. While at Kickapoo Valley Reserve http://kvr.state.wi.us/Home I found out that there is an annual challenge which encourages people to hike all the trails and canoe the river through the park.\xa0 After looking at the list of the trails and how they had broken them into segments for the challenge, I realized I had already done over half of them this summer.\xa0 Knowing I had 22 miles this week I was able to finish another third of them.\xa0 I have just a few shorter segments to finish the hiking portion.\xa0 Then – I’ll just have to figure out how to get in a day of canoeing or kayaking on the river to finish the challenge.\xa0 I’m not worried about the river but figuring out when to fit it in given how late we are in the season is going to be the challenge.  http://kickapoovalley.wi.gov/Documents/Recreation/KVR%20Trail%20Challenge%20Form.pdf I had a whole new experience this week on the trails.\xa0 I am so glad that I found this challenge.\xa0 I found some new trails that were completely different than the trails I have been training on.\xa0 Many of the trails were nice wide, grass paths.\xa0 One of them had a boardwalk along a marsh.\xa0 I didn’t even know that KVR had a boardwalk anywhere.\xa0 Most of the trails at the reserve are single track and narrow. I have a few segments yet to finish.\xa0 I plan on including them for my 12-mile trail workout this week.\xa0 Yep, taper time and I still must do nearly a half marathon.\xa0 It sure doesn’t feel like a taper. This summer I have started listening to audio books while hiking.\xa0 I am enjoying listening to a book better than multiple hours of podcasts.\xa0 I still love my podcasts, but while out on the trails, listening to a book is more complementary to the environment than self help or business podcasts.\xa0 However, when I am doing my road workouts on the bike trail along the highway, those podcasts feel more appropriate than an audio book.\xa0 I’ve been using Libby which is the app libraries use for eBooks and audio books.\xa0 I’ve been using it for eBooks to read through the kindle app for a couple of years and I am absolutely loving using it for audio now. https://meet.libbyapp.com/ Thanks for joining me this week.\xa0 Be sure to check our show notes for links to inspiration items and …\xa0 don\'t forget to stop and smell the roses. Find us on Social Media Facebook fb.me/sensorystrides Twitter @sensorystrides | “What makes your heart sing?”\xa0 Carmine Gallo I recently read the book Talk Like Ted.\xa0 One of my passions is working with high school Girl Scouts.\xa0 The highest award a high school Girl Scout can earn is the Gold Award.\xa0 I am honored to be on our Girl Scout Council’s Gold Award Committee and assist Girl Scouts through the process.\xa0 The first two chapters reinforced much of what I tell others about choosing a good Gold Award project.\xa0 The book is a guide for those making presentations.\xa0 It describes why the TED Talk format works so well.\xa0 The book is structured so those that aren’t giving a TED Talk can still find valuable tips.\xa0 I picked up the book as I have applied to give a TEDx talk next spring and have been thinking about the presentation.\xa0 After reading the book I have more confidence and am eager to create a presentation. The first chapter talks about passion.\xa0 We often talk about identifying your passion when working to choose a Gold Award project.\xa0 The book takes this a step further.\xa0 I love the question the book presents “What makes your heart sing?” (page 55).\xa0 This is about more than passion.\xa0 I think of this as “What gets you fired up?”. This is what gets your heart racing.\xa0 A subject that when it is brought up in conversation you just cannot keep quiet.\xa0 The subject that if your best friend, a stranger, and you were in a conversation and the stranger brought it up, your best friend would just roll her eyes, knowing what is coming.\xa0 The train has left the station and there are no brakes. The second chapter talks about storytelling.\xa0 As I read this chapter, I thought about the interviews related to the Gold Award process.\xa0 Often as we go through the Gold Award process, we answer questions as written or follow a checklist.\xa0 If instead we used each question as an opportunity to tell a story, project connections would be clearer. The ‘why’ of a project would come across more easily.\xa0 Instead of checking requirements off a list, a fuller explanation would be available. By sharing the story, the project becomes more personal.\xa0 Not only to the review committee, but to others as you ask them to support your project.\xa0 The donor, your project advisor, your volunteers.\xa0 All of them will better understand your goals when you share your story. There are a lot of other interesting pieces regarding presentation in the book.\xa0 One I found most interesting was regarding how fast you should speak.\xa0 As someone who speaks fast and listens to podcasts at 1.9 speed, the material presented caused me to pay more attention to my speaking speed.\xa0 I learned a lot about listening too. The presentation tips are valuable for all.\xa0 I know it drives me crazy when a presenter reads every word on the slide.\xa0 Why do we need a presenter? I could have read the slides myself.\xa0 Using the slides to enhance the presentation is a tip many people could learn.  https://www.amazon.com/Talk-Like-TED-Public-Speaking-Secrets/dp/1250061539/ref=asc_df_1250061539/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=266023323049&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4175388889410257643&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9019296&hvtargid=pla-489309437727&psc=1 Thanks for joining me this week.\xa0 Be sure to check our show notes for links to inspiration items and …\xa0 don\'t forget to stop and smell the roses.

One of my friends raced Lake Placid Iron Man this summer.\xa0 She posted pictures on Facebook with her signed copy of Mike’s book. I had heard about the book earlier this year, but it wasn’t in our library yet.\xa0 I had forgotten about it until I saw Jenny’s picture.\xa0 I looked online and not only did no libraries in our regional system have it, no libraries in the entire state had it.\xa0 Well, I knew I had to fix that.\xa0 I emailed the librarian (also a good friend) and asked if she would order the book.\xa0 She did and now not only do I get to read it, but hopefully it will inspire others in the area. There is a story for everyone in here.\xa0 Family stories, stories of survival, fighting back from medical issues, military, everything.\xa0 I highly recommend everyone ready the book.\xa0 I guarantee you will have a new appreciation for Iron Man after doing so.\xa0 Who knows, perhaps you’ll decide you want Mike to call you an Iron Man too.  https://www.amazon.com/MIKE-REILLY-Finding-Voice-Endurance/dp/1733747850/ref=asc_df_1733747850/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353263677590&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11749654833387843159&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9019296&hvtargid=pla-677715789588&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=69532441125&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353263677590&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11749654833387843159&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9019296&hvtargid=pla-677715789588 Thanks for joining me this week.\xa0 Be sure to check our show notes for links to inspiration items and …\xa0 don\'t forget to stop and smell the roses.

How do you get 18 miles in? I had an 18-mile workout to do. I can easily get in 14 to 15 without thinking about where I’m going to go. We have a really nice bike path that goes between two towns that’s about 5 miles long and it is about a mile and a half from our house. However that only got me 2/3 of my miles. On the way back I took a detour around the old highway road, which is fairly residential now. Then I took another detour out of town and headed out to see the new dog park our city put in the summer before heading back into the opposite tide of town from where I live. I then came back into town and walked through the industrial park heading back to the bike trail from where I’d work on my last mile and a half.  The thing that kept me going while I was out was knowing what I was going to have for supper when I got home before I left my husband promised me his French toast he makes the best French toast puts vanilla in it sweetens it oh it’s just so yummy and breakfast for supper is always a treat anyway The next day I had a 14-mile trail workout.\xa0 I decided to hit the part of the trail that will be on the 50k route next month which I hadn’t completed yet.\xa0 I had seen a post from the park that they had just finished cleaning up the trail so I knew it would be good to go.\xa0 One worry I have on some of the trails at the park is the Wild Parsnip.\xa0 Some of the trails are just horse paths, so they aren’t very wide, and the wild parsnip can grow very close to the trail. I’m still not sure if I am glad to have done the trail or not.\xa0 I like to know what I am getting into, but this trail was STEEP.\xa0 Even going down it was difficult since it is so steep.\xa0 I am really glad I decided to purchase trail poles.\xa0 Not only did it help on the steep slopes, but there are quite a few places on this portion of the trail with water and they helped balance as I tip toed across the creeks on whatever rocks I could find. Less than a month to go.\xa0 That means it’s almost taper time!\xa0 I’ll be so glad when I am not out on my feet for hours at a time anymore. I’ve already decided I need to switch it up for next year.\xa0 No more long distances.\xa0 We are going to have to find something else to work towards.

So, I’ve gotten an injury.\xa0 Luckily, although painful, the injury won’t keep me off my feet.\xa0 I still don’t quite understand how the injury occurred.\xa0 A couple of weeks ago my husband and I went away for a couple of days for our anniversary.\xa0 As listeners of the podcast may know, I am an avid reader.\xa0 So, while we were in the car I read.\xa0 When we got home my shoulder was bothering me, but I didn’t really think about it.\xa0 I put the TENS machine on the shoulder to try and loosen it up.\xa0 After a couple of days, it was better.\xa0 However, then we went on a couple hour drive for an event we were attending.\xa0 Again, I read in the car.\xa0 The next day I couldn’t even move my shoulder.\xa0 On the way home, while reading, I felt it tightening up and kept changing positions, but apparently not enough.\xa0 Yep – believe it or not – I hurt my shoulder reading!\xa0 Ugh! I am wondering if this related back to the swimming issue I had a year ago January which I went to physical therapy for and thought was resolved.\xa0 I will be doing my PT exercises again during this training cycle.\xa0 At least it isn’t keeping me from getting out on my feet. We have had so much rain in the area lately although it has been spotty.\xa0 There have been times when one spot will get a couple of inches and another spot just a few miles away will not have any rain.\xa0 It is so strange.\xa0 It has also made it difficult to get out on the trails.\xa0 Between not knowing if it is going to storm and the trails being very wet from the rain, it limits trail activity.\xa0 Luckily the training plan only requires one trail workout a week.\xa0 It’s usually a long one – at least 3 hours and usually longer for me, so fitting in it to the schedule and watching the weather is an ongoing project each week.

Find us on Social Media Facebook fb.me/sensorystrides Twitter @sensorystrides | Quote\xa0“God is great all the time.\xa0 All the time God is great.” Welcome to the Sensory Strides podcast.\xa0 Observations of the world through activity, reading, listening, and everything else. Sometimes you see God’s hand in multiple ways in a short time period.\xa0 This week has been one of those times. Normally when I am on my long workouts I listen to podcasts about podcasting, fitness, or other self-improvement topics.\xa0 One podcast I have listened to is Just Go Bike which is hosted by RAGBRAI and the Iowa Bicycle Coalition.\xa0 Last summer, they interviewed End of the Earth Cycling, who also has a podcast called Cycling for More.\xa0 I was interested in the Cycling for More podcast and subscribed after hearing them on Just Go Bike.\xa0 However, I was so backlogged on my podcast listening that I didn’t get around to listening to the episodes until a few weeks ago. I had kept all the episodes in the playlist and downloaded all the new ones since, so I had quite a few to listen to.\xa0 Cycling for More featured Patty Birchard of Revelation Wellness.\xa0 That episode led me to the founder of Revelation Wellness’s podcast Reving the Word which has workout episodes with encouragement and reflection based on a reading from the bible. Exactly the balance needed on some of my workouts and the best balance I have found for this niche. http://justgobike.net/ https://ragbrai.com/ https://iowabicyclecoalition.org/ https://www.endscycling.com/podcast https://www.revelationwellness.org/category/podcast/ My workout this weekend was a 12-mile trail hike.\xa0 The map for the park I am using for my long workouts doesn’t have trail distances on it, so I estimated what a good route would be for my 12 mile hike that was scheduled.\xa0 I knew I may have to do some backtracking in order to make the goal, but I didn’t want to overestimate and be out there longer than planned either.\xa0 I did do a couple of rounds on one of the trails, before hiking the last mile plus portion back to the car.\xa0 I ended with 12.17 miles – I probably wouldn’t have gotten that close even if the trail mileage had been on the map and I planned it.\xa0 And my Garmin’s battery died about 10 seconds after I hit stop when I got back to the car. I also want to wish Savannah Horstman good luck as she prepares to travel to Orlando to compete at Miss America’s Outstanding Teen.\xa0 This young lady has competed with my daughter in pageants over the last five years.\xa0 She has had the opportunity to compete at state twice before winning this year.\xa0 Savi is a poised, talented, young lady with a heart of gold.\xa0 She has tweaked and focused her platform over the last few years and you can tell she knows what she stands for and how she wants to support others.\xa0 God has plan for this young lady, and I look forward to watching her continue to grow and see the amazing things she is going to accomplish.\xa0 Good luck Savannah!

I did it!\xa0 It has been nearly 11 months, but I got back on my bike again. My husband switched out my pedals for me yesterday, taking off the clipless pedals I used for my 70.3 last year and putting my safer, regular pedals back on.\xa0 I’ve never understood why pedals that connect your feet to the pedal are called clipless.\xa0 I’m glad I didn’t have them on though.\xa0 As it was I almost fell over at the first stop sign.\xa0 It would have been a complete wipeout if I had the racing pedals on. I got back on as my 50k training plan calls for cross training.\xa0 So, the bike is back in the rotation. Although I wasn’t trying to ride fast, I was really slow.\xa0 I had an hour training session and didn’t even get to 10 miles. My butt is a bit sore, but not as much as I would have expected.\xa0 I think my legs are going to be talking to me tomorrow though.

I have been struggling for quite a few months with my weight / body shape over the past few months.\xa0 I don’t necessarily focus on my weight in general, but I do pay attention to how my clothes fit and use them getting tighter or heading into summer as identifiers for when I need to focus on my eating and get things back to what is normal for me. I have been trying since last November to pay more attention to what I am eating and limits sweets and less healthy options.\xa0 I wasn’t seeing any movement so after the first of the year, I started recording my intake on my phone to not only monitor my calories, but also my carb/protein/fat mix and some macronutrients I know I sometimes get low with.\xa0 I stayed within the goals I had for over a month and wasn’t seeing any progress. This has never been a problem for me before.\xa0 Losing weight isn’t easy, but I can be very focused and have always been able to keep my self in my limits when I work at it. I took a couple of weeks off when I went on vacation, but then tried again for another month when we returned. At this point, I am very close to my highest weight ever rather than anywhere near losing weight. I can feel it in my clothes since none of them fit well and in my body in general.\xa0 Even my calves are much bigger than they have ever been before. It is so frustrating, but I’m not willing to give up the fight yet.\xa0 I just have to find a new tact to take.

I want to give a shout out to Lindsay Hiken of the age groupie podcast.\xa0 She completed Iron Man Santa Rosa in May this year with a half hour to spare!\xa0 I appreciate her summary of her race as it really gave me ideas for the future, made me feel ‘normal’ since I race with a standard road bike, and balanced reality and encouragement.\xa0http://agegroupie.libsyn.com/ep-26-ironman-santa-rosa-race-report I loved how she shared her why for racing IronMan and how that came full circle during her IronMan race. I am so on board with the worry about the GI issues. \xa0That is always my first priority the last few days before the race. While listening to Lindsay, I thought back on my first tri.\xa0 Perhaps one of the issues I had was riding the bike I had bought in high school, thirty years before. I was also excited to know that see is a run /walk person when need be.\xa0 I’ve decided that my 50k is going to be run /walk – I just can’t force my body to train that hard for that long.\xa0 Especially since my run pace and walk pace are fairly close.\xa0 I will get all the miles in, just with less impact on the joints. The part about being alone on the course after dark was scary.\xa0 I’m not sure how I would feel about that.\xa0 Especially in the environment she described. I laughed out loud when she talked about not wanting to every get on her bike again after the race.\xa0 I still have touched mine since August.

Gestures like greeting your clients on their way in, and when they are finished with a session, don’t take much, but go a long way towards creating an awesome customer experience.In the personal training business, things are supposed to be more intimate and more personal by default. And there are situations that call for building a community even within the construct of personal training.How to go about describing the benefits of an exercise to a client? What is the importance of touching the client? What do you say to a client who has a goal of losing 25 pounds and is stuck at 15? And to a client who says “thank you” at the end of a session? Stay tuned to know all this, and more.Key Takeaways:Greetings within 10 secs of entering the front doors, with the name added (1:36)An effective introduction - two different scenarios (5:23)Describing the benefits of an exercise through the client’s lens (8:05)A touch on the arm or a pat on the back (11:37)Finding a win for each client in every session (13:30)Holding people accountable; asking them when they’re coming in next (15:58)Thanking your clients before they leave (18:04)---------Additional Resources:Learn About The Alloy Franchise Opportunity---------You can find the podcast on Apple, Google, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts.If you haven’t already, please rate and review the podcast on Apple Podcasts! | In this episode, we are going to explore different types of reward systems and how they positively affect client retention. Rewards, both the structured ones and the ones that are personal and impromptu, go a long way in increasing customer engagement and driving the type of client behavior that you want to see.In concurrence with a set of principles laid out in a book we’ve read, we’ll be emphasizing that it’s important to increase the number of high points in the customer experience. That can serve to offset the things that are just “good enough” and thus help create an overall high customer satisfaction scenario. And yes, the personal touch - exhorting the individual customer towards higher things and celebrating even the small accomplishments, is as important as having a structured rewards system in place.We are going to talk about this, and more, so stay tuned.Key Points of Discussion:Surprisingly personable rewards tell the customer you’re paying attention (0:59)Clients’ gifts, and structured reward programs such as referral incentives (4:01)Taking a leaf out of Disney’s book: Optimizing the peaks, the high points (7:34)Look for little wins for your customers daily, and systemize that (10:51)Little things can create the peaks, as a California hotel case study shows (11:27)Creating high peaks for regulars instead of chasing lowest end customers (17:57)---------Additional Resources:Learn About The Alloy Franchise Opportunity---------You can find the podcast on Apple, Google, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts.If you haven’t already, please rate and review the podcast on Apple Podcasts! | A major challenge facing a gym owner or manager is finding and keeping a team of top-notch personal trainers on board. In this episode, we discuss the concepts and strategies for dealing with trainer turnover.To illustrate the point of turnover, we will use the River & Ponds analogy, which says that some people will come into your business and it will be a river for their career. Meaning, they will be here today then the current (the market) will take them somewhere else in a short period of time.

We discuss the reduction in physical education requirements for our children in schools, as well as the lack of emphasis on teaching the teachers about proper physical education instruction and curriculum development.  Drew also discusses the social benefits of being involved in sports, athletic pursuits, team building and competition, as kids are forced to deal with each other face-to-face and in the moment.  These types of interactions also teach kids how to deal with failure and losing in a constructive manner, operating with rules, personal responsibility, accountability and consequences.  This discussion is important for everyone to hear because of the far-reaching implications for health, productivity and general enjoyment of life.  Drew also explains how much work and time is needed to build physical literacy at the local community level.  The task is daunting, but incredibly necessary.Drew Mitchell works as a consultant focused on the development of physical literacy at the community level and promoting the Canadian Sport for Life Movement.

Jason provides us with a detailed walk through his career in the Navy Seals and identifies the physical tests and ‘weeding-out’ process used by the organization to find the best individuals for the job.  While everyone talks about training like a “Seal”, it is not until you hear about the actual tests and training that you quickly figure out that this lifestyle is not for everyone.  We also get to hear about the grueling rehabilitation process Jason went through following significant injuries incurred in a firefight in Iraq.  The numerous surgeries and physical therapy required to essentially put Jason back together revealed his true grit and resiliency.  Jason discusses these experiences and the leadership required to battle adversity as a motivational speaker and author.  His upcoming book, “Overcome” teaches individuals how to overcome adversity with proven habits and mindsets learned by Jason over his extensive military career, his rehabilitation and his successful career in business.  The book will be released December 10, 2019.Former Lieutenant Jason Redman spent eleven years as an enlisted Navy SEAL and ten years as a SEAL Officer.  On September 13, 2007, outside of Fallujah, Iraq, LT Redman’s Assault Team came under heavy machine gun and small arms fire, and he was severely wounded in the ensuing firefight. While recovering at Bethesda Naval Medical Center, LT Redman wrote and hung a bright orange sign on his door, which became a statement and symbol for wounded warriors everywhere.  He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Valor, the Purple Heart, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Combat Action Ribbons and the US Army Ranger tab along with numerous other personal and unit awards.  LT Redman is the author of “The Trident: The Forging and Reforging of a Navy SEAL Leader,” which details lessons learned in leadership and overcoming adversity throughout his Navy SEAL career, his service in Afghanistan and Iraq and his personal journey with his wife Erica and their three children.Redman retired from the Navy in 2013, and founded Wounded Wear, a Non-Profit organization which supports combat wounded warriors and families of the fallen. In 2014, Redman founded SOF Spoken, a speaking company which focuses on leadership, teamwork, and overcoming adversity for businesses, first responders, sports teams, and government organizations.For more information on Jason Redman, you can follow him via the links below:Website:  https://www.jasonredman.com/Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/jasonredmanww/Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/jasonredmanww/Twitter:  https://twitter.com/JasonRedmanWWThe D&D Fitness Radio podcast is available at the following locations for downloadable audio, including: iTunes – https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/d-d-fitness-radio-podcast/id1331724217https://www.iheart.com/podcast/dd-fitness-radio-28797988/Spreaker.com – https://www.spreaker.com/show/d-and-d-fitness-radios-showYou can reach both Don and Derek at the following locations: Don Saladino: http://www.DonSaladino.com Twitter and Instagram - @DonSaladino YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/donsaladino Derek M.

Specifically, we get into discussions around exercise selection and optimal loading strategies for different scenarios.  Jordan shares his thoughts on the reasons behind various injuries, but also touches on the importance of the psychological mind set around training, competition and rehabilitation.  Whether it’s training in a gym, preparing for a boxing match or leading from the front in a foot race, the attitude you bring will greatly determine the quality of the outcome.Dr Jordan Shallow is a graduate of the 135th class of Palmer College of Chiropractic West, but his passion for human movement go far beyond the classroom. With a critical mind and a decade of training/strength and conditioning under his belt he brings an experience level far beyond his years.

As both Don and Derek have relatively flat feet, they were more than interested in Sean’s opinion on the need for orthotics and the plight of the flat-footed.  We discuss innovations in orthotics over the last several decades, as well as the differences in foot types and individual preferences.  We pepper Sean with questions about frequency of orthotic use, changing between different shoe types, sports and even going bare-footed for some activities.  Additionally, we talk about shoe selection for different types of feet and activities. Sean MacMillan graduated from the University of Calgary in 1994, and began working in the field of Pedorthics in 1996. Sean competed in Track and Field at a Varsity level for 4 years. An Achilles rupture in 2001 necessitated a switch from weekend warrior to coaching. He worked for several years developing and implementing a sprint program for the Kelowna Track and Field team, working with several university and provincial level athletes. In 2003, he was named a National Team coach for the Special Olympics World Summer Games in Dublin Ireland.Sean’s Pedorthic experience began in a technical shoe store in Calgary in 1992, fitting shoes for the orthotist who worked on site. After graduating from University he began his pedorthic apprenticeship with Kintec Orthotics attaining his Certified Pedorthic Technician and Certified Pedorthist designations quickly taking on management of the Surrey satellite clinic. He enjoys all areas of Pedorthics including gait analysis, biomechanical assessment, orthotic fabrication, shoe modification and custom orthopaedic shoes. In 2007, he completed a 120 hour course on Custom bootmaking in central Oregon.

While it may be considered one of the simpler means of exercising and getting into shape, there is not a lot of discussion around how to do it right.  Whether you are a person interested in improving fitness or a professional athlete looking to improving your performance on the field or court, special attention to the mechanics of movement and your running technique can pay big dividends in terms of preventing injury and achieving higher running speeds.

Jason provides us with a detailed walk through his career in the Navy Seals and identifies the physical tests and ‘weeding-out’ process used by the organization to find the best individuals for the job.  While everyone talks about training like a “Seal”, it is not until you hear about the actual tests and training that you quickly figure out that this lifestyle is not for everyone.  We also get to hear about the grueling rehabilitation process Jason went through following significant injuries incurred in a firefight in Iraq.  The numerous surgeries and physical therapy required to essentially put Jason back together revealed his true grit and resiliency.  Jason discusses these experiences and the leadership required to battle adversity as a motivational speaker and author.  His upcoming book, “Overcome” teaches individuals how to overcome adversity with proven habits and mindsets learned by Jason over his extensive military career, his rehabilitation and his successful career in business.  The book will be released December 10, 2019.Former Lieutenant Jason Redman spent eleven years as an enlisted Navy SEAL and ten years as a SEAL Officer.  On September 13, 2007, outside of Fallujah, Iraq, LT Redman’s Assault Team came under heavy machine gun and small arms fire, and he was severely wounded in the ensuing firefight. While recovering at Bethesda Naval Medical Center, LT Redman wrote and hung a bright orange sign on his door, which became a statement and symbol for wounded warriors everywhere.  He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Valor, the Purple Heart, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Combat Action Ribbons and the US Army Ranger tab along with numerous other personal and unit awards.  LT Redman is the author of “The Trident: The Forging and Reforging of a Navy SEAL Leader,” which details lessons learned in leadership and overcoming adversity throughout his Navy SEAL career, his service in Afghanistan and Iraq and his personal journey with his wife Erica and their three children.Redman retired from the Navy in 2013, and founded Wounded Wear, a Non-Profit organization which supports combat wounded warriors and families of the fallen. In 2014, Redman founded SOF Spoken, a speaking company which focuses on leadership, teamwork, and overcoming adversity for businesses, first responders, sports teams, and government organizations.For more information on Jason Redman, you can follow him via the links below:Website:  https://www.jasonredman.com/Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/jasonredmanww/Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/jasonredmanww/Twitter:  https://twitter.com/JasonRedmanWWThe D&D Fitness Radio podcast is available at the following locations for downloadable audio, including: iTunes – https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/d-d-fitness-radio-podcast/id1331724217https://www.iheart.com/podcast/dd-fitness-radio-28797988/Spreaker.com – https://www.spreaker.com/show/d-and-d-fitness-radios-showYou can reach both Don and Derek at the following locations: Don Saladino: http://www.DonSaladino.com Twitter and Instagram - @DonSaladino YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/donsaladino Derek M.

Specifically, we get into discussions around exercise selection and optimal loading strategies for different scenarios.  Jordan shares his thoughts on the reasons behind various injuries, but also touches on the importance of the psychological mind set around training, competition and rehabilitation.  Whether it’s training in a gym, preparing for a boxing match or leading from the front in a foot race, the attitude you bring will greatly determine the quality of the outcome.Dr Jordan Shallow is a graduate of the 135th class of Palmer College of Chiropractic West, but his passion for human movement go far beyond the classroom. With a critical mind and a decade of training/strength and conditioning under his belt he brings an experience level far beyond his years.  With his experience he also brings a level of empathy to his patients, after 15 years of competitive sports and an active lifestyle there is rarely an injury that is on his table that he, himself has not experienced.For more information on Jordan Shallow, you can follow her via the links below:Website:  https://themuscledoc.com/Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/the_muscle_doc/Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/jordan.shallowYouTube:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzXqjJB345oP7LqrTUB52XQThe D&D Fitness Radio podcast is available at the following locations for downloadable audio, including: iTunes – https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/d-d-fitness-radio-podcast/id1331724217https://www.iheart.com/podcast/dd-fitness-radio-28797988/Spreaker.com – https://www.spreaker.com/show/d-and-d-fitness-radios-showYou can reach both Don and Derek at the following locations: Don Saladino: http://www.DonSaladino.com Twitter and Instagram - @DonSaladino YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/donsaladino Derek M. Hansen: http://www.SprintCoach.com Twitter and Instagram - @DerekMHansen YouTube - http://youtube.com/derekmhansen | In Episode 054 of the D&D Fitness Radio podcast, we sit down with pedorthist, Sean MacMillan to talk about orthotics, choices around footwear and the foot itself.  As both Don and Derek have relatively flat feet, they were more than interested in Sean’s opinion on the need for orthotics and the plight of the flat-footed.  We discuss innovations in orthotics over the last several decades, as well as the differences in foot types and individual preferences.  We pepper Sean with questions about frequency of orthotic use, changing between different shoe types, sports and even going bare-footed for some activities.  Additionally, we talk about shoe selection for different types of feet and activities. Sean MacMillan graduated from the University of Calgary in 1994, and began working in the field of Pedorthics in 1996. Sean competed in Track and Field at a Varsity level for 4 years. An Achilles rupture in 2001 necessitated a switch from weekend warrior to coaching. He worked for several years developing and implementing a sprint program for the Kelowna Track and Field team, working with several university and provincial level athletes. In 2003, he was named a National Team coach for the Special Olympics World Summer Games in Dublin Ireland.Sean’s Pedorthic experience began in a technical shoe store in Calgary in 1992, fitting shoes for the orthotist who worked on site. After graduating from University he began his pedorthic apprenticeship with Kintec Orthotics attaining his Certified Pedorthic Technician and Certified Pedorthist designations quickly taking on management of the Surrey satellite clinic. He enjoys all areas of Pedorthics including gait analysis, biomechanical assessment, orthotic fabrication, shoe modification and custom orthopaedic shoes. In 2007, he completed a 120 hour course on Custom bootmaking in central Oregon. Sean is actively pursuing his Master Craftsman designation while working with other members of the Honourable Cordwainer’s Company (A non-profit, educational Trade Guild of bootmakers and shoemakers.)For more information on Sean MacMillan, you can follow him via the links below:Website:  https://www.orthoquestpedorthics.comInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/orthoquest/Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/orthoquestpedorthics/Twitter:  https://twitter.com/Orthoquest_PedThe D&D Fitness Radio podcast is available at the following locations for downloadable audio, including: iTunes – https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/d-d-fitness-radio-podcast/id1331724217https://www.iheart.com/podcast/dd-fitness-radio-28797988/Spreaker.com – https://www.spreaker.com/show/d-and-d-fitness-radios-showYou can reach both Don and Derek at the following locations: Don Saladino: http://www.DonSaladino.com Twitter and Instagram - @DonSaladino YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/donsaladino Derek M.

While it may be considered one of the simpler means of exercising and getting into shape, there is not a lot of discussion around how to do it right.  Whether you are a person interested in improving fitness or a professional athlete looking to improving your performance on the field or court, special attention to the mechanics of movement and your running technique can pay big dividends in terms of preventing injury and achieving higher running speeds.  As such, Derek has created a series of professional courses around improving running mechanics for sport, fitness and rehabilitation purposes.

Though his schedule was unorthodox and at times required training with almost no sleep, he embraced the suck and kept pushing through each and ever workout.  Bobby may not have enjoyed every workout but it would pay off.  On race day the conditions where far from perfect. Bobby started the day with some bubble guts that kept him racing to the porter potty’s. Then an hour delayed start, down pouring rain on the bike with crashes and flat all over the course and finally a break in the weather just in time for a hot run. Bobby didn’t allow any of this to penetrate his mind and just stuck to what his coaches Ray and Danielle Gogarty (The RaD Fam) told him to do. All of this would lead to him crossing the finish line where his saint of a girlfriend would show him the time that almost put tears in his eyes. -Weather that day: 85Water Temperature: 73.9Age Group:   M25-29Height:   5’7”Weight:   175Calories per hour: 448Nutrition Company used: InfiniteDepth of Wheels: Basic stock rimsPSI for this course:   100Bike Elevation Gain: 725Run Elevation Gain:   354Swim: 37:12:00T1: 6:47Bike:    2:42:55T2: 6:21Run: 1:51:14Total Race Time:   5:24:27Gender Rank:   306 out of 1461Division Rank: 30 out of 165Overall Rank: 348 out of 2037- Follow Bobby on Instagram: @Path2iron-Follow Coach Terry:Instagram:  @PerfectRacePodcast | It was an incredible experience racing at the world championship level and in Europe for the first time.

What\'s really stood out to me this year is how connected we are in the triathlon community; it may look in my race pictures like I\'m alone out there, but the reality is I have training partners, family, sponsors, coaches, and so many other people that enable me to do what I do. I\'m grateful for every finish chute, this one in particular because qualifying is a huge honor and because I was so sick going in that I wasn\'t sure even on day of if I would race. The bike course is certainly challenging, but I\'m happy to see Ironman supporting a venue that feels more organic and authentic than some of the courses where athletes are on a closed off highway. I can also attest that the water in Nice is really as blue and beautiful as the pictures show.

The focus of this class is lower body, especially outer hips, glutes, and quads. Your attention will be repeatedly drawn to your feet in order to create balanced muscle engagement and stacking of joints. Release expectations of classic Sun Salutations (beyond two and a half rounds of side-wall lengthening Sun A to calibrate the breath), be ready to move front to back of the mat, and take it one breath at a time. We will hold, we will flow, we will challenge muscle memory. Hip-opening horse squats and hip-strengthening active malasana squat with a twist make an appearance in this flow and invite you connect with your center. The center line is explored further in balancing postures like standing figure four and tree pose. Hip, core, and balance work come together in our peak pose – side plank tree leg variation. Half-pigeon finishes the hip opening theme with a bang, providing much-deserved ‘dessert’ as you hold and breathe. What has been opened must be closed, and in the wind-down we explore postures with neutral and closed hip alignment. Legs up the wall pose finishes our lower-body journey and prepares the body for rest in savansana. Enjoy! P.S. If you have a child that already began the school year, I bow to you for surviving the summer-to-reality transition and for rolling out your mat. Let’s GO, parents! | This is a 75-minute Gentle Flow. This class focuses on offsetting one postural affliction of the modern age – slumped shoulders that round forward, crowding the chest and leaving little space for an expansive heart. This class explores your wingspan through open arm twists in many body configurations – folding forward, on knees, standing, squatting, and lunging. The class begins slowly and thoughtfully. A luxurious start on the back leads into Sun Salutations A that calibrate the breath and warm up the body. The pace of Sun Salutations B is measured (read: slow burn). Long holds offer ample opportunities to set up, refine, and deepen your standing postures. Special attention is given to the foundations of poses: your hands and feet. Get ready to notice small details that have the capacity to change a pose completely. This class is not an anthology of poses, but the poses that are offered have been carefully selected and are covered in more detail, more color. I invite you to slow down your practice and to *notice* how each pose feels. Don’t be fooled by the name. You will work, and you will grumble to yourself about my calling this gentle. The pace is gentle. The rest is pure commitment to growing your practice on the mat. Enjoy! | This is a 65-minute Power Flow. This class focuses on opening the chest and the hips. Many a chest-expansion are offered, however, as always, they are optional. We start out slow, but don’t let that fool you. High-to-mid planks, committed holds, and flowing breath to movement will challenge you and bring you into your body. Sun Salutations A set the pace for the breath, and the practice quickly gains speed and intensity as we add standing power poses. We explore hip opening in different planes, with different effects of gravity. Balancing challenges are added to take your practice up a notch or to bring it down a few pegs, in case you are feeling overconfident. Dancing Shiva pose makes an appearance as our twisting peak, and Tree Leg Side Plank puts all of the hip opening, hip flexor preparation, and core engagement together. We wind down slowly and mindfully, offsetting external rotation of the femurs with neutral and then internal rotation, easing into Supine Twist Eagle Legs. This practice is a challenge, an exploration, a study in balance and flow. It is a chance to connect with the breath and to let it get you through anything that is placed in front of you. Enjoy! | This is a 60-minute Classic Flow. The focus of this class is symmetry – front to back, side to side, to the front of the mat and to the back, clockwise and counter-clockwise. We explore all sides of the mat, and with them, all sides of the body. A fair share of hip opening and posterior chain activation comes into play as we hold, flow, and balance on the hands and on the feet. This class explores symmetry of movement, and you are invited to be a passenger on this yoga adventure. Let me drive, and just focus on the posture, the movement at hand. Worry not, you will be even and whole by the end. This is an exercise in trust and in restraint. The pace of this class is moderate, but it will make you work. Classic Sun Salutations A and B get a make-over, and not one Vinyasa transition (high-to-mid plank, up-dog, down-dog) makes an appearance. If you ever find yourself thinking that yoga classes have a formula, this may make you think otherwise. Flying Frog is one of our peak poses, and so is Tree Pose. An all-around core-activating segment invites every side of your torso to the party. You will feel well-worked. How can you not, when you have held a forearm plank? If you get easily bored, this class is for you. If you love routine, this class is also for you. You will feel at home while also discovering something new about your practice. Enjoy! | This is a 60-minute Gentle Flow. The focus of this class is the core - the powerhouse of stability that wraps around the center of the body and includes not only the front, but also the sides and the back. This class is a slow burn - we move with intention and honor the breath, while holding poses for a spell or two and feeling the burn. You will begin to notice new components in foundational poses such as Downward Facing Dog, Warrior 2, and Table Top. We explore alternatives to the classic Vinyasa high to mid plank transition, such Locust, Rolling cobra, and Child’s pose. We activate the core in a variety of side stretches and strengthen it in balancing poses on hands and knees as well as in standing postures. Special attention is given to achieving a balance between hip flexion and hip extension. If you love core work, this class is for you. If you dislike core work, this class is also for you. This is not a “Belly Blast” VHS workout from 90s. You will be challenged. More importantly, you will be pleasantly surprised. Enjoy! | This is a 60-minute Classic Flow. This well-rounded practice is built around the idea of squaring the hips and twisting from the mid-back. We open the shoulders, ignite the core, challenge the quads, glutes and hamstrings, and work on isolating spinal twists while keeping the hips level. Chest-opening and shoulder-waking Sun Salutations A give way to Sun Salutations B featuring Crescent Lunge and its core-challenging variations. Modified Pyramid Pose provides a hip-leveling check point as we flow and eventually becomes full Pyramid Pose. Revolved Half-Moon is the peak pose that we work towards and where we put it all together. This practice incorporates back-body work and offers poses for strengthening the spine. We wind down with a few reclined stretches that release tension in the hips and calm the nervous system. If you love Crescent Lunge, this is your practice. If you don’t love Crescent Lunge, this is your opportunity to flow through it and learn that discomfort is temporary and that your strength is infinite. Enjoy! | This is a 65-minute Classic Flow. This practice is as continuous of a flow as it will get. The special focus of the class is lengthening the sides of the torso and twisting more productively. Lengthening the sides and twisting go hand in hand, and we explore this dynamic relationship through a flowing practice grounded in a series of powerful standing poses. Moving through a variation of classic Sun Salutations A warms up the body, and special attention is given to waking up not only the front and back of the body, but also the side walls. Sun Salutations B continue to ignite the sides, while energizing the legs and opening the hips. The last series of standing poses work up to Revolved Triangle by way of Warrior 1 and Pyramid pose. A progression from Gate Pose to Modified Extended Half Moon presents the final challenge for the sides of the body, while allowing the heart rate to settle. Camel pose is the peak backbend offered in this practice, and it is intended to take advantage of the now supple side body walls. The descent into rest is restorative and slow, as always. If you are looking for a flow practice to take you out of your head and deliver you into your body and breath, this class is it. Enjoy! | This is an 85-minute Classic Flow. Let’s start 2019 with a BANG and BIG dose of presence! The first practice of Season 2 is a special, extra-long well-rounded practice that opens the chest, inner thighs, and outer hips. This practice offers a luxurious opening that allows you to truly arrive and relish in how good it feels to just move on your mat. Rounds of Sun Salutations A introduce gentle back-bending and chest-opening and ignite the quads. Sun Salutations B fluidly move front to back on the mat and back again, offering full body engagement in standing poses. A special focus on inner thighs will make you smile, or at least notice that you have inner thighs. Crow pose flies by. Fly with it or keep your crow grounded. This is your practice. The next standing series puts it all together as we work up to Airplane pose (aka Warrior 3 Airplane Arms), Humble Warrior, Triangle, and end with the lusciously restorative Wide Leg Forward Fold. As we come down to the mat, more hip openers are offered -- one-legged and two-legged -- as well as some gentle twists. Bound Bridge pose draws on the warmth we have built in our thighs and completes our chest-opening, back-bending adventure. As the descend into stillness begins, a sense of deep well-being is bound* (yoga pun intended!) to wash over you. This class will make your body hum with gratitude, pure joy, and warmth. Enjoy! | This is a 60-minute Classic Flow. In this class we bring the magic of breath to movement to the forefront of our practice. Rounds of Sun Salutations A wake up the spine, the core, and the hip flexors. Repeated rounds of chair pose bring energy and warmth to the quads, preparing them for standing postures. Moving Sun Salutations B work up to triangle pose, and rounds of one-legged plank flow gently work the core while featuring breath front and center. Warrior 1 and pyramid pose continue to prepare the legs for our peak pose - revolved tringle, which wrings out tension while challenging the sense of balance. Gentle backbends sprinkled throughout the practice are welcome counterparts to all the forward bending (and also to living in a hunched-over world). A mellow half pigeon and easy seated forward fold ease tension in the hips and lengthen the sides of the body. This class offers repetition in rounds of poses to let you focus on your breath, to let it shine, to let it rejuvenate you. We make shapes in order to access the breath and the sense of presence here and now. This class is intended to feel like a moving meditation, a journey within - with breath as your guide. Enjoy! | This is a 60-minute Classic Flow. In this class we address glutes and outer hips with strengthening and lengthening postures. Take this flow at your own pace and bring mindfulness to all repetitions of the offered poses. Instead of just getting through it, challenge yourself to be present and fully immersed in the journey. The destination is secondary, while the journey is the whole point. Echoes of poses you have seen earlier in the class show up later with a twist. Enjoy them! Welcome them! Take them up a notch, if you wish. After a gentle waking of the spine in Sun Salutation A without any chaturanga pushups, we move into a dynamic flow of standing postures in Sun Salutation B and belly-down core work which targets all three layers of the glutes; all I ask is that you follow along mindfully, feeling each movement rather than rushing through it. Gentle twisting in the mid-back paired with spine-lengthening concludes the ‘hard work’ portion of class, and after we take it down to the mat with Half-Pigeon (which can always be substituted with a reclined figure four stretch on each side), the ultimate hip and glute release. A few more relaxing stretches prepare your body for slowing down and going deep in Savasana.

Now that September is here it’s a great time to take advantage of fall and get back into a regular fitness routine. Fall is considered the 2nd January in the world of fitness. People begin to get a bit less busy and have time to think about themselves more. Are you ready to see what you can do to reboot your exercise routine? Listen to this episode to discover tips and tricks to get back on the fitness wagon.\xa0 Outline of This Episode  [2:22] We have a wavy line of consistency [7:23] Why a detox? [10:43] Certain times of year make more sense to do a detox or reboot [15:55] Why is a mindset reboot important? [20:24] How do you make it into a daily or weekly practice?  The wavy line of consistency Let’s face it, it’s hard to maintain consistency with your diet and exercise. Our straight line to transformation is actually more like a wave. You’ll probably never achieve that straight line that you envision but you can make those waves smaller. As fall begins this is a good time to get back into some good habits. We tend to slow down more. The days begin to get shorter, you may get more sleep and find time to shift your focus back to yourself. Taking a challenge is always a good way to shift your focus back to yourself. Find out how you can shift your focus and make that wavy line of consistency a bit less wavy.\xa0 Why detox?\xa0 Detox isn’t something you do for 7 days or 3 weeks. Detox happens every day in your body. Your liver and skin are your main detoxification organs. But there are things you can do to support your liver as it detoxes your body. Avoiding alcohol, sugar, and processed foods can help your liver not have to work so hard. Refined oils also cause a lot of inflammation in your body. Limiting the number of times you eat out can really help minimize the amount of refined oil that you consume. Have you ever done a detox? Certain times of year make more sense to do a detox or reboot During the summer you might be exposed to more sun or eating out more. Vacations are a prime time for processed food overload. You may have overloaded your body, but you can help it out by stepping away from the toxic load. Detoxing is like rebooting your computer. When you remove sugar, alcohol, dairy, and gluten you can help your body detox naturally. You don’t have to remove them all. But if you have never done a full-on elimination you should. You’ll never truly understand how food is affecting you if you haven’t experienced a full detox. A detox kit can help get you over the hump and rid you of those sugar and carb cravings that happen during detox. Why is a mindset reboot important? Let’s face it, there is a lot going on in life. Occasionally you need to shift your focus back to yourself. It is important to tune into how your thoughts are creating your emotions which are creating your actions which are creating your results. Take some time to dive into family, fitness, fun. Try adding things into your life like a daily gratitude practice, more water, or more veggies. You can also consider removing something that is not serving you any longer. What do you need to do for your emotional well being?

Sleep is so important to overall health yet it often is last on our list when it comes to healthy routines. During sleep, your body is repairing itself and keeping your hormones in check. There are many people that don’t get enough sleep or don’t get quality sleep. In this episode, we’ll discuss misconceptions about sleep, the amount of sleep that’s right for you, and whether you are getting quality sleep. Listen in to episode 43 to hear tips to help you make sleep a priority. Outline of This Episode  [2:12] Quality of sleep is just as important as quantity [3:50] Quantity of sleep [9:10] What about your quality of sleep?\xa0 [17:05] Let’s talk lighting [21:42] Tone down the stimulation  How much sleep do you really need?\xa0 Everyone is different and we all need different amounts of sleep. There is no one perfect set amount of sleep that is right for everyone. How can you judge whether you are getting the right amount of sleep? Do you wake up feeling rested and ready to begin the day? Examine your energy level throughout the day. Do you have enough energy to get through the whole day? If so, does caffeine play a role in your life? If you are really interested in testing your sleep try removing caffeine from your life for a while. You should also consider your food cravings. Do you crave carbs and sugar constantly? This could be a sign that you are not getting enough sleep.\xa0 What about your quality of sleep?\xa0 Quality of sleep is just as important as quantity. Remember that exercise and proper nutrition improve sleep quality. People can forget how important eating well can be for your sleep. Ideally, you should eat a healthy meal 2 hours before bed. Caffeine and alcohol consumption also can affect the quality of your sleep. If you are suffering from poor quality of sleep then try removing caffeine from your life.\xa0 Do you find yourself waking up in the middle of the night?\xa0 Many people find that they can’t get a full night’s sleep. This has to do with your blood sugar levels. Normally your cortisol spikes around 6 am when it is time to wake up. But if you haven’t eaten a proper dinner with lots of protein and veggies then this could cause a blood sugar imbalance in which your cortisol spikes between 2-4 a.m. One way to combat this is to eat a (very) small amount of fat and protein right before bed.\xa0 More tips to improve sleep and make sleep a priority in your life  Create a bedtime routine. What’s yours like? Do you watch TV? Have a glass of wine? Try reading a book instead. Your evening routine plays a huge role in how well you sleep.\xa0 Dim the lights. You may not have considered the lighting in your home to be the cause of your sleep problems. But your body’s circadian rhythm can be put off balance by using bright lights. They can stimulate your brain into thinking you should be awake.\xa0 Turn off the devices. The blue light from the screens is bad for sleep. Make sure to stay away from screens like tablets, phones, computers, and TV at least 30 minutes before bed.\xa0 Tone down the stimulation. Watching the news or exciting TV dramas or even reading thrillers can stimulate your brain into working harder and cause you to stay awake longer. The information you put in your brain before bed can have a huge impact on the quality of your sleep.

Have you ever reached a goal only to find it slip away months or even years later? Why does this happen? On this episode, we’ll dive into the reasons that we tend to sabotage our successes. Then you’ll learn what you can do to prevent self-sabotage so that you can continue to move forward with your goals. Listen to episode 42 to discover how to prevent your own self-sabotage. Outline of This Episode  [2:42] What is cybernetics? [7:35] Do you create problems for yourself? [12:55] Look at how you made your changes [15:38] How to stop [25:21] You're never going to accomplish what you can’t see.\xa0  What is cybernetics?\xa0 Cybernetics is a good way to explain self-sabotage. Cybernetics is the study of control and communications of machines to regulate or reach an end goal. Cybernetics is like an autopilot mechanism or a thermostat. When you set it, it controls other forces to return to homeostasis. For instance, if you have the thermostat set at 72 and you open the windows in the summer the thermostat works extra hard to try to get back to normal. The same is true for people. You may have worked hard to lose 20 pounds, but your body may work even harder to gain it all back.\xa0 Do you create problems for yourself? We often create problems for ourselves. We aren’t happy unless we have created stress. Instead of creating problems, create goals. What is your next hill to climb? If you have achieved your weight loss goal think about what else your body can do. Train for something different so you don’t get bored and begin to create problems for yourself.\xa0 Self-image is key Maintaining results is often harder than achieving them and that is often due to self-image. How do you see yourself? Do you think you are someone who needs to lose weight? Or do you see yourself as someone who has accomplished a lot? Create a new self-image that is more in line with the new you. Identify with your new self-image and lock it in. When you identify with the new you, it will become harder to revert back to those old habits.\xa0 How to stop self-sabotage  The first step you need to do is identify the problem. Once you are aware of the problem then you can take action. Next, you can start looking at your behaviors. This will help you to shift your actions so that you can move forward.\xa0   After that, you can begin to learn. Feed your brain. Read, listen, or watch something to help you improve. When you feel yourself slipping dive into new material to help you learn. When you surround yourself with the knowledge it takes to move forward it will become harder to slip back into homeostasis.\xa0   Surround yourself with people who are doing or being what you want to do or be. Sometimes it's hard to physically be around those people so surround yourself with online friends. You can also align yourself with a mentor, coach, or therapist. They can help you recognize self-sabotage and achieve your goals.\xa0   One last thing you can do is to program your mind to move forward. You can do this by goal setting or vision casting. Your level of success can never rise above what you envisioned internally. You're never going to accomplish what you can’t see.\xa0  Resources & People Mentioned  BOOK - Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz  Connect With Justin & Janell  http://TheTransformationClub.fitness  Subscribe to The Transformation Show onApple Podcasts, Stitcher,  Spotify,  Google Podcasts | When is the right time to make a change in your life? Timing is an issue that comes up time and time again when we talk about transformation. Everyone wants to get started on changing their lives but the time just doesn’t seem right. Summer is full of vacations, then there’s the fall with back to school and routine, next come the holidays. Is there ever a right time to make a lasting change in your life? Learn what you can do to discover when is the right time to make a transformation in your life by listening to episode 41 of The Transformation Show.\xa0 Outline of This Episode  [1:22] Something always comes up [6:32] Perfectionism is a deep-rooted fear [8:00] It’s time for a mindset shift [13:20] A 4-step process to help you consider the timing [18:01] The timing will never be right [20:22] Get the momentum going  When is the right time? We often say: I can’t start now, it’s is not a good time, maybe when things slow down, I’ll start after my vacation. But every time you plan to start your transformation journey something comes up. A new job, an ailing parent, an upcoming vacation, the kids’ activities. Or it may not seem like the best time of year to try something new, summer is always busy, fall means back to school and a new routine, then the holidays roll around and you know you don’t want to miss out on all that delicious food! We rely on these external factors as a means to not take action. They are really just excuses. Something will always come up and there is no perfect time to start anything. That’s just life. Life will always throw you curve balls it's learning how to navigate those curve balls while moving you forward. When is the right time for you to make a change? Examine the situation Is this something you really want to do? Using timing reasons for not starting to work toward your goals is wishy-washy. Try using this 4-step process to think about if you really want to work toward changing your life. This can work in the business or career realm as well as fitness.  Are the objections you have real or just a smokescreen to hide your fear and insecurities?\xa0 If it is a smokescreen then dig into why you are doubting yourself. Are your limiting beliefs creeping in? Once you have uncovered your doubts decide if you are magnifying them. Are you creating unnecessary anxiety? Anxiety triggers inaction.\xa0 Look at your goals objectively. Does the potential gain outweigh the downside? If so, then get started. Remember the timing is never right if you don’t want it to be.  Are societal norms holding you back? You can also ask yourself some questions. Are the beliefs you have around timing based on someone else’s opinion? We often have these deep-seated beliefs based on societal norms. They might be embedded in your subconscious. Think about what is best for you. Not about what society or the people around you. Take this transformation as an opportunity to shift your mindset. You’re not too old or too young. What is important is how you will benefit from changing your habits. If there is something to gain that you really want, then take action.\xa0 Don’t let your perfectionism get in the way of progress Perfectionism is a deep-rooted fear. It is a limiting belief that you will not be enough if you can’t attain the perfect result. So it ends up that you would rather than do nothing than do something imperfectly. So many people choose to not start something because they can’t go all-in at the time. You don’t have to go to the gym 5 times a week. If you can only go twice a week right now then that is so much better than never going at all. When you can get the momentum going and develop a consistent habit it will help you so much when life throws you those curveballs.\xa0 Resources & People Mentioned  Episodes  38 and  40 on limiting beliefs  Connect With Justin & Janell  http://TheTransformationClub.fitness  Subscribe to The Transformation Show onApple Podcasts, Stitcher,  Spotify,  Google Podcasts | Are you able to identify your limiting beliefs? Our limiting beliefs are part of our identity. I’m not a morning person. I’m not athletic. These are some examples of the ways that our limiting beliefs can hinder our transformation. In this episode, we’ll walk you through some common limiting beliefs and how they can hold you back from transforming your life. If you haven’t listened to episodes  38 and  39, you’ll want to refer back to these. They don’t need to be listened to in any order, but they do have pertinent information to help you understand how limiting beliefs affect you and the stories you tell yourself. Discover how to identify your limiting beliefs Outline of This Episode  [4:52] What are limiting beliefs? [6:59] Some common limiting beliefs [9:22] What are Justin’s limiting beliefs? [12:12] Overcoming your limiting beliefs gives you confidence [21:55] Is the all or nothing mentality holding you back? [32:11] Notice that your limiting beliefs drive your habits  Who do you identify as?\xa0 I’m not a morning person. I’m not athletic. I work out daily. I can’t get everything done. We all identify as some type of person. This identity can really affect us when we try to make changes in our lives. Your limiting beliefs could be holding you back from your transformation in more ways than you know. 8 years ago I would never have worked out while on vacation, but now I am consistent about my workouts because I am a person who works out. I move my body every day. Are your limiting beliefs holding you back from achieving your goals? How do limiting beliefs work? So many people think that the results they achieve (or don’t achieve) have nothing to do with their limiting beliefs. But our limiting beliefs dictate how we think. They control the thoughts that we have. Your thoughts elicit feelings and create chemical reactions in your body. Your feelings then fuel your actions (or inactions). And your actions dictate your results. Then your results come around again and reinforce your beliefs. This is a cycle of beliefs - thoughts - feelings - actions - results. The results we see in our lives are because of the beliefs that we have. How have your limiting beliefs held you back from achieving the results you want in the past? Identify your limiting beliefs What kind of limiting beliefs do you have? There are many common limiting beliefs surrounding fitness and health. Here are a few examples:  Working out is hard Losing weight is hard I don’t like healthy food I’m not a morning person Going to bed early limits ‘me time’ I can’t have fun without alcohol I’m not athletic Everyone in my family is overweight  The first step in overcoming your limiting beliefs is to identify them. What are your limiting beliefs when it comes to health, exercise and fitness? Think about how your limiting beliefs drive your habits.\xa0 Overcoming your limiting beliefs gives you confidence Have you ever overcome a big obstacle? How did you feel afterward? Once you overcome a limiting belief then you know that you can do great things. It gives you the confidence to strive for more. When Justin set out to become a bodybuilder he had a lot stacked against him. He didn’t have the genetics or physique to become successful. But he made the decision to do it and got it done. He didn’t waver. His success in this has led him to become successful in other areas. What are your successes? Resources & People Mentioned  Episode 38 - Limiting beliefs part 1 Episode 39 - The stories we tell ourselves  Connect With Justin & Janell  http://TheTransformationClub.fitness  Subscribe to The Transformation Show onApple Podcasts, Stitcher,  Spotify,  Google Podcasts | The stories we tell ourselves can either positively impact our goals or be very detrimental to our well-being. We all tell ourselves stories to help explain things that happen in our lives. But we tend to wrap our limiting beliefs up in those stories. The truth is you can create negative stories or positive ones based on your perspective or your limiting beliefs. The stories we create are often based on our past experiences. These stories are so powerful that they can even impact our physiology. This is a great episode to listen to after episode 38 on limiting beliefs. After you listen to that one, give this one a go, to discover how your limiting beliefs are affecting the stories you tell yourself.\xa0 Outline of This Episode  [2:22] The stories we tell ourselves impact our physiology [7:28] Your brain doesn’t know the difference between something imagined and something that has actually happened [9:31] Are you telling yourself a story or a fact? [16:55] You still need to process loss [22:57] Are you telling yourself this story as a way to process emotion? [27:05] What can you do to change your stories  Identify your limiting beliefs\xa0 Our limiting beliefs are wrapped up in the stories we tell ourselves. And before you can move forward and change your stories, you need to identify your limiting beliefs. Then analyze how those limiting beliefs are impacting your stories. Instead of changing your story right away think about why you are telling yourself this story. The things you focus your energy on can become a problem if you let them. This is why we need to shut the light out on the negative stories so that we can give fuel to more positive stories.\xa0 Is it fact or fiction? The stories we tell ourselves can be quite deceiving and it can be hard to discern whether something is fact or just a story. Try to detach yourself from the situation to find out. Details are facts. For example, you lost 11 lbs and your friend lost 30. That’s a fact. You weren’t focused enough and she has an easier life. That’s a story. Practice detachment and learn to recognize the facts and separate them from the story. Use the facts to move forward. You can reframe that story to celebrate your accomplishments to make it easier to visualize the future.\xa0 How much energy are you putting into your stories?\xa0 The average person spends hours each day creating stories which lead them into a suffering state. Your negative stories can lead you to feeling disempowered, unmotivated and generally stuck in your limiting beliefs. We all waste time, energy, and emotion by spinning negative stories. Your negative stories could be a way for you to process emotions. Think about how you could better spend your time. Do you think you spin stories based on your emotional experiences?\xa0 What can you do to reframe your stories? Now that you know how to identify your stories and the way your limiting beliefs play a role it’s time to take action. The first thing you can do to change the stories you tell is to identify them as stories, not facts. Keep listening to podcasts and books to help you with your limiting beliefs. You can also talk to friends or a mentor to help you work these stories out. If you don’t have a friend or mentor to talk to (or even if you do) try reflection and journaling. When you write down these stories be sure to tear them up or burn them. This act of symbolism will help you move forward beyond your limiting beliefs. What will you do today to change your stories?

Danae is a french designer who specializes in sustainable design in Paris.  A few years ago she started teaching yoga and ayurvedic cooking. She\'s now practicing these two activities at the same time. She believes that building bridges between yoga and ayurveda is the key to health and happiness.  The practice is adapted according to your dosha, the season and your pathologies. Practicing yoga led her to a non-violent lifestyle of veganism. What is traditional Ayurvedic yoga?Ayurvedic yoga is based on the knowledge of Ayurveda and dosha balancing (Pita, Kapha, Vata).When our body, mind and spirit is balance we do not get sick, we are happy and full of energy. At the beginning there was no separation between yoga and ayurveda, then one started to develop as a spiritual practice as the other develop as a medicine.The yoga I teach comes from Sri Aurobindo’s vision on integral yoga.The goal of yoga is to reach the state of "union" with oneself and the world around us, cultivating joy and energy into our everyday lives.Integral Yoga combines different styles of yoga, Hatha Yoga, Pranayama (Breath Yoga), Yoga Nidra (Dream Yoga), Meditation (Spirit Yoga), Kundalini Yoga (Life Energy Yoga), Mantra and Song to balance our dosha.Danae\'s Green Agni Balancing HummusGreen Agni Balancing Hummus300 gr of raw edamame beans (or peas)1 clove of garlic1 cif of cumin1 garam massala (or 5 spices, ra salt hanout)a handful of fresh corianderjuice of a whole lemonsalt and pepper3 tbsp olive oil1 tbsp sesame or tahini seedsMix everything and add a little water for the texture and that’s it!The edemame and the green peas tend to balance Kapha and Pita but they are very charged in air element when they are raw.To avoid a Vata imbalance in the recipe you can first cook the beans, which will make the hummus sweeter and replace the olive oil with sesame oil.Kapha may feel lighter using sunflower oil and without sesame seeds.Danae also offers workshops on ayurvedic cooking, and how to use spices and food to come back to our true nature.

Are you interested not only in the physical practices of yoga, but also by the philosophy and history? Do you want to learn more and go to a deeper level with your yoga practice? Perhaps you have been a practitioner for many years, but never seem to quench your “yoga thirst”?  If any of those statements apply to you, then you share something in common with Advanced Certified Jivamukti Yoga Teacher, Julie Kirkpatrick, who is also searching for deeper meaning of life through a deeper understanding of yoga and how it can help modern people live a meaningful life in troubling times. The founders of the Jivamukti Yoga method, Sharon Gannon and David Life, granted Julie the Advanced Jivamukti Yoga Teacher certification in 2005. David Life is Julie\'s brother, so the method has been accessible to her since its inception in 1986.  Julie has been and continues to be a student of the method and a seeker of understanding of yoga, since that time. She completed her 300 hr. training in 2003, and her 800 hr. training in 2004. Her association with Jivamukti Yoga has allowed her to teach classes, workshops, and retreats abroad in Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Spain, Turkey, Canada, and Vietnam, as well as in the United States in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Michigan, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Ohio. Julie brings to her yoga classes a wide range of experience, having taught a variety of class styles including open, basic, vinyasa, prenatal, children’s yoga, and restorative classes. She strives to bring together practitioners through a sense of community with each other, for really, there is nothing more valuable in yoga then coming together as a community of spiritually minded truth seekers, which happens every time we gather together to practice yoga.  Julie strives to uphold this vision. Before focusing full time on teaching yoga, Julie worked in public education, visual arts, and community gardening. She was an activist for fair housing and community garden preservation on the Lower East Side of New York City, where she has lived with her children Jules and Alex Febre since 1981.Connect with Julie:Facebook: @julie.kirkpatrick.58Instagram: @juliefrancine1 Listen & Subscribe | Victoria Moran is a vegan of over three decades, a yoga practitioner of half a century, and was voted “Peta’s Sexiest Vegan Over 50” in 2016.

This is one of the most common questions for those embarking on a path that includes resistance training for either strength or size. Not all programs are created equal, and without spending the time and money to get a personalized program from an expert trainer it can be difficult to design a program that is right for you. In this episode, Nick and Ben give a general construct of how you should layout your weekly routine in order to maximize your results.\xa0 | Can there really only be just one component that\'s holding you back from achieving your fitness goals? Maybe you\'ve read article about the "5 Things..." or "Just do these 7 things..." The truth is, at the core of every "thing" you need to do to achieve success is one common denominator that if you can get it right, everything else falls into place. Nick gets one on one with you about what that One Thing is and how it will change your outcome. | In our third episode of our Pregnancy Series, Nick speaks one on one with Dawn Granger. As a mother of four kids, and a bikini competitor who recently took first place in her first NPC competition, Dawn shares with us her struggles and successes throughout her fitness journey. Dawn shares never-before told stories about her fitness, nutrition and depression throughout her four pregnancies and what it was like pulling through and turning it all into a promising and developing fitness career. | In the second episode of our Pregnancy Series, we speak with Ben\'s wife, Tracy, about her fitness journey as it pertains to her two pregnancies as well as the aftermath while raising three beautiful girls. This episode is a treat, as Tracy speaks not only from the perspective of a mother but also as a trainer who helps clients maintain their fitness throughout their pregnancy.\xa0\xa0 | So you\'ve done everything you need to do before your workout session, you put all your effort into it and now it\'s time to head out. But what do you do now to make sure that you get all of the benefit from the time you just put into your fitness? Are there certain things that you even should be doing, or can you just coast for the rest of the day? Nick and Ben have a list of things for you to do so that you can feel confident that you\'re making sure the juice was worth the squeeze.\xa0www.thefitnesslounge.net | How often have you shown up for your workout and just started right into it? Maybe you had a long day, or an early morning, and simply getting to the gym and finishing on time is all you can think about. Have you felt frustrated after many months of not seeing the results that you expected? Nick and Ben bring you a list of things that you can do prior to showing up for your workout to make sure that you get all the benefit you can from that session. | As the first episode in our Pregnancy Series, Nick and Ben have an in depth conversation with Dr. Charlanne Gasper about the effects that nutrition has on a pregnancy. This is interview is jam packed with helpful information that most mother\'s may not have heard before.\xa0 | Growing muscle isn\'t always rainbows and butterflies. There can be some real challenges that accompany this decision. Nick and Ben take a lighter look at some of these challenges and make fun of what can be rather frustrating realizations of growing muscle.\xa0 | So, maybe you\'ve heard about macros and that you should "count them". You might have even heard some catchy tagline like "If It Fits In My Macros" while referencing a bowl of ice cream with Oreos and gummy worms sprinkled on top. But what are "macros"? And why should you be concerned with them? Nick and Ben clear the air about what macros are and how they impact your nutrition. Whether you\'re looking to lose body fat or put on lean muscle, knowing the answers to those questions will help you achieve your goal and stay there.\xa0 | Have you ever been told that doing cardio exercises causes you to lose muscle? While that can be a true statement, it is also true that there are certain types of cardio that can contribute to muscle growth. Nick and Ben cover the different ways in which doing cardio can help you put on lean muscle mass. It may be time to rethink how you approach cardio in your workouts.', 'chan_desc': 'Tackling your questions about fitness, health, wellness and mindset.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/2c/15/59/2c155946-b6f2-1eca-15ee-34346389e8bf/mza_7934139107657960852.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-07-16'}}

It is responsible for most of what we don’t do in our lives.Fear as an emotion  has helped us stay alive and evolve. However, in modern culture there are few things to genuinely be afraid of to save our lives, fear often prevents us from taking action toward achieving our goals.In an equestrian context, fear does have some necessity and thus it is important to honour it and take steps to build courage and resilience.Most of us are afraid of feeling unpleasant emotions and because we are fearful of them we avoid anything that brings them up.What are you most fearful of?What would be different if you were not afraid?And remember – don’t let fear hold you back! |  | In episode 9 I open up a bit about my life, my battles with feeling lost, the provocation for those feelings and how I found 'me' again.I am posting this for cathartic reasons but also in hope that it will help you too. You see, fitness coaching isn't just about getting you fit... it is as much about getting you to believe you are worthy of looking after, spending time on yourself.When you are lost, in busyness, in overwhelm, in anxiety you lose sense of self awareness, and if we are not careful can lead to a non functioning and depressed individual.www.eventingfit.com | In this episode I share with you my 3 main approaches to core training for equestrians 1. Rehabilitative movements, 2. Dynamic Core Training 3. Flexibility. Learn why sit ups and planks alone are NOT the answer and what you can do to make your training more effective. |  | In this episode, learn if its coaching or therapy that you need.

This episode discusses what goal discomfort is, why we experience it and how you can set goals and shout them to the world, without fear of failure, embarrassment or justification. | Self-sabotage is something you may not even realise that you do! Its a way for us to remain comfortable, to retain control and to avoid negative feelings. However, if we learn how to allow ourselves to feel emotions, reflect on them, accept them and stop the procrastination, buffering and other sabotage techniques, we get to reach our goals faster and get out of our own way.

Same bat time, same bat place. | https://youtu.be/A6xDjVXJFG0\xa0Ok, if you never read another bio, please read this one. Janice Marie is out of her mind with awesomeness. She was on episode number #14 of the podcast way back in the day and I honestly hope that she is on about a dozen more.I had a work commitment which caused me to cut the podcast short, otherwise, we would still be talking. This is really a great episode.Below is Janice Marie Ferguson:Hi! Here are some things about me:Janice Marie Ferguson, you can call me Janice. I like Janice Marie, that\'s what my family calls me, as I\'m named after an aunt. I really didn\'t like to be called just Janice after she died, because that\'s what a lot of my family called her, and it felt weird for people to call me that, but Janice Marie is a lot to say for regular people, and she passed in 2004. So, I\'m better about it now, and I\'ve all but given up on the whole Janice Marie thing for regular people who don\'t know my family.-Born and raised in Biloxi, Mississippi, but lived in Texas, my favorite state, for six years.-We have goats, cows, chickens, European hogs, just a regular Old MacDonald farm. My husband does most of the work keeping up our animals. We live in the same property with my parents, where I grew up. My kids loved living next to their grandparents. I have the best parents in the world!-Broke the Mississippi high school state record in the indoor mile when I was in 10th grade in high school. Then, got on a bad path and never ran track again after my sophomore year. :(\xa0 But, look at me now! Spent my entire 30\'s trying to make up for that failure to launch phase of 16-20 years old.-Baylor University graduate (BA in Journalism) It took me 6 years to graduate from college. I was a non-traditional student, married with two children and commuted an hour to school, after dropping my kids off for school every day!-42 years old (Unlike most Southern women I know, I don\'t care if people know how old I am.)-I have had a lot of jobs over my last 30 years: lifeguard, amusement park employee/ride operator, golf course attendant, concession stand worker and cotton candy maker, video arcade attendant, cashier and cook in a small country store, like the kind you see in the movies where the locals can still have store tabs and all the men of the community come for breakfast and lunch. I\'ve actually worked in two of those. I was a veterinary technician, worked at a riding stable, as a telemarketer, worked at K-Mart, was a sales clerk at a western wear store, worked in a glass repair and installation shop, worked in a cabinet shop finishing cabinets, was a Miss Teen USA beauty pageant director, waitress in several restaurants, Relay for Life PR chairperson, cocktail waitress in a casino, non-profit association membership coordinator and national conference trade show organizer, military wife, worked as a freelance journalist--specializing in feature stories, residential remodeling construction, banquet captain at the Beau Rivage executing the details and event orders for up to 1,000-person sit down plated dinners, conference coordinator/event services at the Beau Rivage, high school cross country coach, basketball booster club president, science teacher, Science Olympiad coach, classroom teacher, President and CEO of the Garage Games (I don\'t even know if they are still around?), cross country coach, basketball booster club president, and a gym owner. Being a gym owner is the thing I\'ve stuck to the longest. My gym has been open since 2013. I started in my back yard in 2011 with a boot camp, moved to a public park, then a 900 sq foot storage unit by 2013. Now, we have a 6000 square foot full fledged facility, a nutrition coaching business alongside our CrossFit and six amazing coaches. I make seven.-I wanted to be a horse trainer when I was a kid! Never did do that. But, I\'m not dead yet. One of my members is a horse chiropractor, and that sounds very interesting! | https://youtu.be/uM23ne3owfAThere have been some conflicting stories regarding Big Thirsty\'s trip to Area 51 so we will just have to take his word for it.Von\'s father-in-law, Denis passed away this week. He was a financial backer in Olive Branch CrossFit. It probably just seemed like another check or a typical loan to Denis but without that, LHRL® does not exist, our CF community does not exist, my relationship with these people does not exist and my marriage does not exist. Every action has significance.Wilson snuck off and participate in A Race for the Ages which is a race put on by Lazarus Lakes which gives you as many hours as you have years of life to finish as many one mile loops on a paved road as possible.

He established a new “American record” in “marathon golf” with an elapsed time of 13 hours, 35 minutes.\xa0Knight played pretty much non-stop, with “aid station” breaks totaling about an hour to eat breakfast and dinner, and for six breaks “to get a glass of milk into which was dropped a raw egg and to bind up a swollen wrist that he had sprained playing a sunken ball.”He averaged about one stroke per minute, drove the ball out of bounds five times and into a creek five times, with only two birdies. It was thought that this record would last for years, but later in 1919, Eddie Styles startled the golfing world when he played ten rounds (40 miles) in a single day averaging less than 80 strokes per round. Their efforts kicked off the bizarre sport of “marathon golf.” | https://youtu.be/yKPu0rMT9_YSaddle up!Here we go. Episode #159:Amanda starts a training plan on top of her training plan. Von steals the janitor\'s keys in high school so he could roam the halls and lower the basketball goals. Thirsty has his mom correct him on Twitter.We discuss the new Mr. Rogers movie and whether or not he would be a Twitter-rager if he were alive today.Fall weather and fall running plans.The kind of people who don\'t make more coffee after drinking the last cup and the importance of refilling the ice trays in case of hangovers.It\'s all quality material.

He had some kids, got fat, got skinny, got fat again and then got healthy. Played a bunch of Racquetball, Joined \xa0Crossfit Springfield in 2010 and got back into running and cycling. By 2015 he had completed the Pikes Peak Marathon which sounds as scary as it is. In 2016 qualified for the USA Triathlon Duathlon National Championships which he didn’t attend. The summer of 2017 came across the LHRL podcast, bought the deadlift program and went from a 340# DL to 400 by 2018. Since I was turning 50 in 2018 decided to run 50 miles to make my entrance into the 400/50 club. In 2019 launched the Legion of Longevity page to help ageing athletes and regular people expand the health span of their life span. Their mission is to help those who care about a long and full health span learn some of the best and most sustainable nutrition and training practices for people at all levels. The vision is that members of this group will improve their own journey as well as share it with their friends and aging parents. The ultimate hope is that everyone that chooses to live a full life will live a life of active abundance.

Pregnancy is one of the miracles of life and a beautiful chapter, but what they forget to tell you all the things that start to happen to your body on a skeleton level and what to expect after the birth. In this episode we talk about the importance of why visiting a chiropractor during pregnancy can help provide you with an easer birth and tips on self care immediately after having baby. \xa0 About Dr. Jame Macris I am a caring and passionate chiropractor who loves everything about birth. Pregnancy and birth is such an empowering experience for women. With my unique perspective on health, and how the body works, I align and guide expectant mommas, so you can focus on what's really important.\xa0As a chiropractor, I look at the spine and nervous system to make sure your body is communicating to its fullest potential. This is vital during pregnancy; first, so that you can experience the most comfort during pregnancy, second, so that you may delivery your child with the most ease, and third, so that you can heal quickly and bond with your new babe.\xa0I graduated from Life West Chiropractic College West, where I learned a range of techniques (from gentle, low force to instrument assisted)\xa0to address the pregnant and pediatric spine. I am currently pursuing my diplomate from the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association, as well as being  Webster Certified to better serve you and your growing family. Dr. Jane love spending her time with her friends & family in nature, seeing life through her 7 year old son and 4 year old daughter’s eyes, and learning about new holistic and spiritual approaches to living a healthy life. \xa0 link to Perineal massage to prepare for birth:\xa0Perineal Massage During Pregnancy - American Pregnancy Association \xa0 \xa0  For more info on the host, visit, www.grindbabe.com and follow Alex on Instagram @alexgarzaro!\xa0 Want a chance to win some amazing Prizes  Leave a review on Apple Podcasts\xa0 Take a screenshot of your review!

Keep Truckin Coach Tregs | In this episode I talk with Ry Williams who is a part time PT and full-time post man originally from Hereford.He recently did a 30 day challenge eating only Mcdonalds in which he lost 16lbs and got in great shape (he was already pretty lean but lost over a stone).He\'d been interviewed here there and everywhere with a mix of good and bad press so I thought why not get him on for a chat.We discuss his reasons for doing this challenge and what he wanted to prove.We also talk in depth about the type of foods he ate off the Mcdonalds menu, how he felt on a daily basis and how he performed during training.This is a real insightful podcast and goes way beyond simply discussing calories in vs calories out and looks deeply at peoples relationship with food.Sit back, relax grab yourself a coffee and enjoy our chatter. As always I\'d love to hear your feedback. Keep Truckin Coach Tregs | In this episode with just myself, I discuss some of the mistakes I have made during my 13 years in the industry.This was inspired by the news that the author of a booked called the \'PH Miracle\' is being sued by a client in the US for over 100 million. The story is that he advised her to quit her chemotherapy and use his methods which include taking \'baking soda\' from a tea-spoon to change the PH of the body so that the disease could not live in the supposed \'alkaline\' state.This method failed and she now has not long left to live.I talk about going on courses in the past to continue my education only to be given similar misguided advise.Whilst I have never advised anyone who has cancer I admit I did used to tell people to \'alkalise\' and \'detoxify\' as this was the current message being passed on by my peers at the time.It\'s an open and honest talk where I\'m happy to admit I got things wrong and am way more comfortable to give a much more logical message.Sit back, relax grab yourself a coffee and enjoy our chatter.

Our bodies are amazing and can work hard when we want to.  But it’s also very important to give our bodies rest, as well.  When we take a day off from those hard workouts it gives our bodies time to repair themselves.HERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT REASONS THAT REST DAYS ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS WORKOUT DAYS. Rest days allow your muscles time to repair.Did you know that when you’re lifting weights, you’re tearing your muscle fibers?  Giving your body proper nutrition (which includes plenty of protein) and allowing it to rest is the best way for you to build stronger muscles.  If you work the same muscles multiple days in a row, you aren’t allowing them time to repair themselves and increase in size and could be doing more harm than good.  You also may not see the results you’d like because your muscles aren’t being given enough time to heal, and your chances of injury can increase. Rest days help you avoid burnout.We’re putting in the necessary effort to see results but then it happens, we get burned out.  Trust me, it happens to us all, me included back in the day. Giving your body a few days off will help you feel rejuvenated and ready to get back to work.  Also, make sure you change your workouts up when exercising. I try to change things up a bit and swap out moves or try a different style of working out.  If you feel like you’re getting burned out, try change your workouts up a bit. Rest days reduce the risk for injuries.If you work a muscle too often, it has a less chance to recover.  This can lead to weak (tired) muscles and in turn potential injuries.  Along with this, if you’re over-training certain muscles, your body will utilize other muscles to provide support to your skeletal system.  You risk injuring these other areas because they are trying to provide support for those weaker areas that have been over-worked.  Over-training can affect our sleep.Are your sleep habits all over the place? Over-training could be the reason. Too much exercise can put your body in a constant state of restlessness or on high alert making a good night’s sleep tough to achieve. A big sign is an increase in your resting heart rate. Taking those rest days can help bring down your alertness and heart rate, which can help get you a night of sound sleep. Make sure to get a good night sleep, it will help heal and recover from those workouts. WHEN SHOULD YOU TAKE A REST DAY?How often you have days off from the gym depends on where you are in your physical fitness journey.  If you’re beginning your fitness journey, a good rule of thumb is to rest every third day.  If you’re a more experienced athlete, resting once a week is usually enough.  But you should try to avoid working the same muscle group multiple days in a row.  What constitutes a rest day also varies depending on your activity level.  If you’re doing high intensity interval training, or killing it in the gym, a full inactive rest day is more likely needed for your body to fully recover.  If you’re workouts have been on the light to moderate side, an active rest day is enough.  This could mean going for a long walk, doing some relaxing yoga or foam rolling.   Rest days are critical for our mental and physical health.  Allowing ourselves rest can help fuel us to the next workout performance.  Don’t be afraid to take a day off, they are just as important to our health as a workout. | Detox. It's one of those popular expressions you hear constantly.A seasonal detox is an effective way to clear your body of toxins, which will also speed up your metabolism and enhance your overall health. Start by decreasing the amount of sugar you consume and keep your foods closer to natural whole foods.When done correctly — that is to say, in a healthy, safe and controlled environment —getting your body clean and healthy can result in a wide range of positive effects.If you are not convinced, yet. These are some reasons, detoxing can help you...1. They help remove toxins from the body.Whether it be the long-term exposure to toxins (environmental pollutants, cancer-causing chemicals, preservatives, pesticides, heavy metals, and industrial waste) affects our metabolism, behavior, immune system, and leads to disease. They can be stored in tissues and cells throughout the body, including the brain, often for years – holy moly! 2. Doing a detox annually or bi-annually can prevent chronic disease.Environmental toxins are responsible for many cancers, neurological diseases, heart disease, strokes... you name it. Our bodies do have a built-in detox function to deal with these dangers, but those systems are constantly overloaded! Detoxing assists and improves what our bodies are trying to do naturally.3. Bonus! It can aid in your weight-loss. Toxins can influence the body's natural ability to burn fat, leading to weight gain. Diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure are directly linked to weight issues. Detoxing rids the body of toxins stored in fat cells and increases metabolism.4. It can enhance the immune system function.Goodbye to sickness! A compromised immune system makes us vulnerable to colds and flus, affecting our quality of life and productivity. Regular detoxing helps strengthen immune system functioning and fights off infection.5. You can improve your quality of life.Our bodies don't function very well when they're loaded with toxins. We may have joint pain, headaches, digestive disorders, sleep problems, and lack of energy. Depression may be eased, and memory may be improved as a result of detoxification. Of course, everyone is different of course and people’s bodies will detox differently.6. Hello energy!Not only will you have more mental, physical, and emotional energy after detoxing--people also say that they sleep better!7. It can slow down premature aging.Detoxing rids the body of free radicals and heavy metals partially responsible for aging. Detoxing helps to increase nutrient absorption, including antioxidants and vitamins that help fight oxidative stress. 8. You will experience more mental and emotional well-being. When the body's systems are aligned, a shift also occurs with our mental and emotional states. We can deal with more when we're clear and grounded. We can make better decisions, have a clear mindset, and see things differently.9. You will be glowing. Nutrition and environmental toxins undeniably affect skin. Detoxing improves acne, and strengthens hair and nails, and gives us a natural, healthy glow.10. Detoxing will create more of a balance to our body's systems.Our digestive, nervous, and hormonal systems were designed to work together to achieve optimum health. This is what our bodies want to do! When we overload them with toxins and unhealthy foods, these systems don't work as well as they should, and we get sick.If you are ready to learn more about how to unlock the power of food to heal your body and achieve optimal health? You can get The Determined Fitness 7-Day Detox eBook, and get started right away on your mental, physical and emotional clean-up jump start!http://daynadetersfitness.com/determined-fitness-7-day-detox-meal-guide/ | Have you ever had that feeling that want to do something but the thought freaks you out?But maybe…you are getting to that point where you’re ready to act? But that action leads you to keep finding excuses to delay starting because of fear?This could be because you’re:Comparing yourself to other peopleTelling yourself that it might not workNot confident about what you knowAfraid of what other people will think or say about youWondering if anyone will value what you have to sayHave you ever felt this way before?I know I have – MANY times!Every single one of these thoughts and feelings is driven by fear – your mindset around fear – and your mindset is something you can shift if you’re dedicated to understanding why you feel a certain way at any given time. But taking time to practice this, will weaken the fear and make your wants much stronger. When I talk about breaking through fear, I don’t mean that I don’t (or that you won’t) still feel those feelings: fear and a lack of confidence; but now I’m able to (and you can, too) embrace the fear that causes those feelings and breakthrough it as a result.If you are wondering how to get through this and break free from your fear-- I will be going over many ways to embrace your fear, practice healthy ways to weaken the fears, and break free from what is holding you back in this episode. | Unless you’ve been under a rock or maybe a pile of never-ending laundry for the last few years- you’ve probably heard of the term “self-care”. We all need it, but rarely do we take it. This word can mean different things for different people. For some- it’s going to get a massage. For others it’s just a few hours of alone time to read that book that’s been on your end table for the last six months or like me a full year collecting dust. If you’re an extrovert and ‘refill your tanks’ with the energy of those close to you, it can look like scheduling that much-needed coffee date with your best friend.What do I like? I love to wake up an hour or so before my husband and two kids so I can get my workout in peacefully. It’s that simple. Starting my day off with that hour to myself is one of the best things I can do for myself, and therefore the people I care about.I also feel my best when my body is healthy. I usually LOVE taking walks (when it's nice out) at lunch during my break to get a little exercise and some deep breathing going. If I’m in need of some extra mental clarity during the winter I will use the treadmill to get some extra steps in and get re-energized. Another thing I make sure to do to prioritize my own self-care? I ask for help. My hubby is great at helping when I ask, which is sometimes all I need. He also knows when I need a break (usually when I start yelling at the kids...lol). Mom life happens and we all have our moments. I think we should all be able to agree that self-care is not selfish… it’s necessary.My advice? Let the guilt go. It is not serving you- it’s impairing you.Tune out the negative voices and focus on yourself, because when you do that and you’re overflowing with self-worth and confidence- everyone wins. And that certainly doesn’t sound selfish to me. | Not everyone has the same goals, and therefore no two goals are ever going to be approached in the same way! So today we will tackle the two very common (but different) goals in fitness: weight gain and weight loss. Keep in mind that these are general recommendations; there are many ways to accomplish a goal. But these are good places to begin with if you’re just starting out!Ready to jump in? Let’s do this!What you will learn in this episode: Weight-loss: 1. Eat more veggies and cut down on other carbs (pasta, rice, potatoes, whole grains, legumes, couscous, bread). Not saying that all carbs are bad, they are great in combination with other food groups! But too many at once, can do more harm than good. 2. Exercise More. You still might be someone that needs a little bit more physical activity in order to get into a negative energy balance, if you work workout roughly for 20-30 minutes a day, and not seeing a difference than maybe add another 10 minutes to your routine. Weight Gain (aka, muscle gain): 1. he way to create this stimulus is through intense and consistent resistance training. Once it’s in place, you’ll need the right amount of protein and calories to support the growth.2. Don’t do as much cardio as you would for losing weight. And support human-growth-hormone production by getting adequate sleep and optimizing your nutrition and fitness.For more help on this, visit: www.daynadetersfitness.com Ideally, you’ll want to combine both diet and exercise for a one-two-punch combo to maximize your efforts. | If you’re lagging behind on working towards your goals or find yourself losing speed on progress, it may be time to take a step back and observe your surroundings. The answer to any stalling could just be your environment.Pay attention to your surroundings, from the environment to the objects and foods and people that are in it. If none of these align with your lifestyle or goals, then it’s time to make a change. See how doing so affects the way you think and feel.

This time of year, we’re also flooded with (lame) articles about how many miles you need to jog to “run off those holiday treats.” Let’s be real, people mostly love the holidays because of the food!But I did want to give you a friendly reminder that you don’t need to “exercise away” any of the holiday treats and it doesn’t really work like that anyway.It’s not like you get on the treadmill and a box of fudge magically disappears. I wish, right?! I like a grand scheme of things approach: sticking to a routine over the long haul so you aren’t too behind when it comes to the 1st of the year.

SO stay tuned to my website at www.daynadetersfitness.com.Thanks for listening and take care of yourself by giving yourself some YOU time! | If you ask me to choose one single strategy to help you reach all your wellness/fitness goals, I wouldn’t hesitate. I would tell you: Meal Prep.WHY IS MEAL PREP A BIG DEAL?Meal prep is key to a healthier living practice, not only will it help you shed some LBS but also help you with stress of making food when your kiddos are STARVING....In short, meal prep is about preparing ingredients or entire meals ahead of time so you can spend less time cooking and more time nourishing. Meal prep makes it possible for you to eat well and reach your goals. Without a consistent meal prep practice, you’ll find yourself struggling to make healthy happen. Yes, meal prep takes time, but consider it invested time. Because the busier you are, the bigger the return when you make prep a consistent practice. Pick and day and keep that date for yourself and the kitchen. Start small by adding one meal at a time for prep-- If you are starting out. If you overwhelm yourself than you may not even do it, be realistic. I share my tips that help me when it comes to my meal prepping, and when I find most helpful.
