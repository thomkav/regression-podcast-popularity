The criminal factions and dark government agencies are just the start of the malevolence that roams the streets of this macabre city. The tales in Sirenicide tap into the fear and lore that envelope what most would consider to be fiction. The production plays host to a plethora of popular personalities from other nightmarish podcasts. The main cast of creepy, courageous, and curious characters evolve with the overarching story, but they also chronicle some amazing self-contained, standalone tales. The original music serves each episode’s atmosphere in a way that embraces and enhances each scene.

It\'s difficult to contemplate now. But it was thanks to another man that many of them were brought to life. Today, Richard Burbage is a not a household name. But he should be. He\'s the man for whom many of the great Shakespearean roles were created. One of the founding members of the Lord Chamberlain\'s Men, playing at the newly built Globe in 1599, he\'s one of the foundations upon which British theatre was built. Andrew Dickson talks to leading actors, rummages among the archives and dissects some of the greatest parts in acting to discover Burbage\'s crucial role - and realises that without Richard Burbage, there could be no Shakespeare.Producer: Penny Murphy | Playwright Mark Ravenhill challenges our adulation of the Bard and asks: Is Shakespeare\'s genius beyond question? Casting a sceptical eye over centuries of bardolatry, Ravenhill calls for a new approach to the plays.Exploring the intellectual tradition that has seen important figures from Voltaire to Tolstoy to Wittgenstein challenge Shakespeare\'s supremacy, Ravenhill searches for today\'s dissenting voices. Tracing the transformation of a working playwright into a national poet, global brand and secular god, Ravenhill asks if it\'s still possible to enjoy Shakespeare without being overwhelmed by the cultural and commercial baggage of \'brand Shakespeare\'.Meeting Royal Shakespeare Company Artistic Director Gregory Doran, theatre director Phyllida Lloyd and actors Simon Russell Beale and Fiona Shaw, Ravenhill explores what Shakespeare\'s plays mean to theatre-makers today and asks if Shakespeare is a problem for a contemporary theatre which seeks to give an equal representation of women\'s experience of the world.Joining RSC actors in a primary school for a performance of Taming Of The Shrew, Ravenhill wonders if a play of such dark and complex sexual politics is really suitable material for ten-year-olds.Scholar Ania Loomba describes India\'s changing relationship with Shakespeare, while Professor Gary Taylor talks about the ambivalence of large parts of America toward the Bard.Other interviewees include: playwrights Edward Bond and Howard Barker, RSC Deputy Artistic Director Erica Whyman, Shakespeare academics Ewan Fernie, Dr Martin Wiggins, Michael Dobson and Dr Erin Sullivan of the University of Birmingham Shakespeare Institute.With readings by Amanda Drew and Paul Ritter.Producer: Matt Willis | Gareth Malone and Margaret Drabble on strength and nature | Eve Best, Danny Sapani and Shaun Dooley star in the magical product of the Bard\'s later years.

Una guerra abierta entre las zonas rivales de la ciudad de los vientos.En este año 2019, se cumple el 90 aniversario de dicho suceso, por lo que era una buena oportunidad de hacer una ficción sonora ‘original’, basada en la prensa de la época, recreando el caso, además, de cómo se planeó y se desarrolló.El guion original cuenta con todos los elementos necesarios de la mejor novela negra de gánsteres, viviendo ambientaciones que nos harán adentrarnos en los dorados años 20 del siglo XX.Para la recreación de este radioteatro han sido necesarios nueve actores y actrices de voz, consiguiendo de esta forma un amplio abanico de registros. Tanto la creación del guion, como la dirección de la obra ha sido realizada por Juan Francisco Corredera, locutor de Radio Alicante SER y actor de doblaje, con una trayectoria de más de 20 años al frente a los micrófonos. El cuadro de voces de la ficción sonora, está completado por Paco Gil (Al Capone), Laura Gil Pérez (Moni LeBlanc), Jose Luis García (Bugs Moran), JoseMa Teira (Hoover Preston) y Juan Francisco Corredera (Jack McGurn) y además, las voces adicionales de Noemí Berna, Pedro J. Fernández, Enrique Mensaque y Santi Roca.La ficción sonora ‘La Masacre de San Valentín’ ha sido grabada en los estudios de Radio Alicante SER, durante los meses de diciembre de 2018 y enero de 2019. | Guión adaptado y dirección: Teo RodríguezMontaje: Teo RodríguezActores:Jorge Ponce (Jorge)Jose Angel Juanes (J.P)María Teresa Neila (Rita)Rafael Calvo (Sr. Ruiz)Y mención especial para Claudia, Marta y Matilde, tres niñas maravillosas que son la esencia de esta historia.Ahora la Navidad es un ente lleno de luces y artificios que acribillan nuestros ojos y oídos. Durante siglos, la Navidad y especialmente la Nochebuena fue el momento en el que familias enteras se reunían en torno a la luz de las velas para recordar viejas historias de terror. Vamos a contar una de aquellas historias.La señorita Claudia va a pasar las Navidades a la mansión de su tío segundo. La niña ha perdido a su familia recientemente y, aquel hombre al que apenas conoce, le ha invitado para que pase las fiestas acompañada. A la estación va a buscarle el chófer, un joven entrometido que le habla de aquel misterioso tío.El trayecto se hace largo, no hay nada aldedor, solo árboles. Hasta que, en medio de la carretera aparecen dos niñas que les observan ¿quiénes son? Pregunta Claudia al chófer, pero él no puede verlas, ¿o si?Basada en una historia de M.R. James | La mañana del 22 de diciembre nació clara y soleada, con el frescor seco de un día de invierno suave. Las plantas mostraban restos de una tenue nevada y la hierba brillaba mojada. La gente del pueblo empezó a congregarse en el huerto público alrededor de las diez. En algunos pueblos, había tanta gente, que la lotería duraba dos días, y tenía que iniciarse el día 20. Pero en aquel pueblecito en el que apenas había 300 personas, todo el asunto ocupaba, a penas, un par de horas. De modo que podía iniciarse a las 10 de la mañana y dar tiempo, todavía, a que los vecinos volvieran a sus casas a comer.Los niños fueron los primeros en acercarse, la escuela acababa de cerrar para las vacaciones de Navidad y la sensación de libertad producía inquietud en la mayoría de los pequeños. Pronto llegaron los hombres y las mujeres poco después. La lotería era dirigida por el señor Summers, un hombre jovial, que llevaba el negocio de las semillas y la gente se compadecía de él porque no había tenido hijos y su mujer era... una gruñona. Cuando llegó a la plaza portando la caja negra de madera, se levantó un murmullo entre los vecinos... | Una mujer llega a una clínica de fisioterapia para quitarse unos nudos en la espalda. En la habitación de al lado hay otra persona. Suenan gritos. Nada preocupante... de momento. La sesión de fisioterapia deriva en acupuntura, la mujer se va relajando, va dejándose llevar, todo su cuerpo está en las manos del invidente fisioterapia. Pronto la mujer se queda inmovilizada, no puede moverse, no puede gritar. El extraño hombre comienza su discurso, coge un bisturí, empieza con los cortes...\xa0Según los psiquiatras 1 de cada 50 personas es un psicópata en potencia. ¿Con cuántas personas te has cruzado hoy? ¿A cuántas personas has dado al espalda?.Un relato de Juan Lobo dirigido por Ramón Verdet con la participación de Marta Flich y Mario Urquiza. | "Soy un hombre de lo más desafortunado. Rico, respetado, bastante bieneducado y de buena salud [...].El hogar familiar se encontraba a unas cuantas millas de Nashville, en Tennessee, en una vivienda amplia, irregularmente construida, sin ningún orden arquitectónico definido, y algo apartada de la carretera, con un parque de árboles y arbustos. En la época a la que me refiero yo tenía diecinueve años y estudiaba en Yale. Un día recibí un telegrama de mi padre tan urgente que, obedeciendo a su inexplicada solicitud, partí inmediatamente con dirección a casa. En la estación de ferrocarril de Nashville, un pariente lejano me esperaba para poner en mi conocimiento la razón de la llamada: mi madre había sido bárbaramente asesinada; el móvil y el autor nadie los conocía."Así da comienzo esta historia de miedo y misterio escrita por Ambrose Bierce. Un relato que viaja entre dos mundos: el de los vivos y el de los muertos.Guión adaptado y Dirección: Teo RodríguezMontaje: Teo RodríguezJulia: Charo SoriaJoel: Pablo ConcejeroCaspar: Juan D\'OrsBayrolles: Carlos PiñeiroPolicía 1: Juanjo RuizPolicía 2: T.R. | Es de noche y el viento sopla fuerte. Los árboles se agitan violentos y la cabaña parece un refugio diminuto y frágil bajo la tormenta. Un grupo de amigos se reúnen allí, quieren pasar un fin de semana divertido y deciden jugar. Pero a veces los juegos pueden ser peligrosos. Pueden ser fatales.Una leyenda dice que en aquel bosque habita una niña, una niña abandonada que trae la desgracia a aquel que la encuentra y trata de calmar sus llantos. A veces es difícil encontrarla por eso hay que invocar a las oscuras fuerzas del más allá para traerla hasta aquí. Parece un juego, es solo un tablero y un vaso. La puerta que comunica este mundo con el otro, está entreabierta y es mejor dejarla así aunque hay algunos que deciden entrar.¿Quieres ir con ellos?

Quando gli inquirenti si recano a casa di lei per una perquisizione, si rivela in tutto il suo orrore un terrificante sottobosco di perversioni, violenza, morte e satanismo, che scuoterà a fondo e in modo indelebile l’opinione pubblica italiana. | Nelle campagne bergamasche, alla fine dell’Ottocento, alcune donne vengono brutalmente aggredite: l’assalitore, e in alcuni casi omicida, morde e beve il sangue delle sue vittime. La sua identità sarà scoperta dopo anni di paura: è Vincenzo Verzeni, il vampiro di Bergamo, studiato anche da Cesare Lombroso. E se Verzeni fosse veramente un vampiro e si aggirasse ancora per campagne e valli bergamasche? | A cavallo tra il 1832 e il 1833, in un piccolo borgo del Canavese, San Giorgio, a due passi da Torino, spariscono nel nulla due bambine. Che cosa è successo? L’esercito regio, distratto dai primi moti risorgimentali che scoppiavano nel resto d’Italia, liquida i fatti attribuendoli ai lupi. La verità è ben diversa e decisamente più spaventosa. | Michele Profeta. Che effetto fa l’ambizione quando si scontra con il fallimento e l’anonimato? Quando lo scenario è una città laboriosa e tranquilla, l’esatto contrario dei sogni di gloria e godimento di uno dei suoi ospiti, che a fatica ti fa emergere, se non sei animato da una costanza e fiducia nelle tue capacità. La storia di un uomo normale che normale non voleva essere, giunto a un punto della vita nel quale non c’è più tempo per progettare, ma solo arrendersi, o tentare l’ultima scorciatoia. | Uccide due bambini e lascia messaggi provocatori seminando il panico nella Foligno dei primi anni Novanta. È Luigi Chiatti, nato Antonio Rossi, abbandonato dai genitori in tenera età, seviziato in orfanotrofio e adottato da una famiglia borghese; un giovane uomo che semina il panico, e tiene con il fiato sospeso grandi e piccini. Quella del mostro di Foligno è una delle storie più macabre e controverse mai avvenute: il ritratto spietato di una personalità complessa e indecifrabile. | È l’alba del 15 novembre 1994. Una donna si lancia da un’auto ferma al casello di Vicenza Ovest invocando aiuto. L’uomo da cui chiede di essere protetta è invece seduto, calmo e tranquillo, al posto del conducente: il suo nome è Gianfranco Stevanin. Arrestato per stupro e sequestro di persona, verrà condannato a tre anni. Fino a che, all’interno dei terreni di famiglia, emergono uno dopo l’altro i cadaveri di quattro donne, selvaggiamente uccise e meticolosamente occultate. Quattro omicidi, secondo l’accusa; quattro incidenti, secondo Stevanin, occorsi durante sessioni di sesso estremo. E il processo si trasformerà in uno dei primi grandi dibattiti italiani sulla capacità di intendere di volere. | È forse l'unica donna serial killer della storia d'Italia. Milena Quaglini, classe 1957, nata in una modesta famiglia della provincia pavese, da vittima si è trasformata in carnefice, uccidendo due uomini che l'hanno a loro volta stuprata. Il suo è il primo caso nazionale del genere. Dopo un'infanzia difficile dovuta alla presenza di un padre che la picchiava, e un primo matrimonio da cui ha avuto un figlio maschio, Milena conosce quello che diventerà il suo secondo marito, Mario Fogli, un uomo violento che aprirà la strada al suo primo omicidio, quello di Giusto Dalla Pozza, 80 anni, e che sarà la sua seconda, ma purtroppo non ultima, vittima.La donna è morta nella sua cella nel carcere di Vigevano, strangolandosi con dei pezzi di lenzuolo e appesa al gancio per appendere gli abiti del suo armadietto in acciaio. | Roberto Succo. La storia della sua fuga francese, dei cinque morti accertati, delle vittime stuprate, dei sequestri ha un’origine lontana. Risalente a quell’aprile 1981, quando decise di ribellarsi all'autorità della madre. Che non lo lasciava respirare. Il mostro a due teste. | Un giorno di primavera di fine anni ’90, sul treno Ventimiglia-Genova, una donna viene uccisa mentre si trova in bagno, senza un motivo apparente. È la seconda donna nel giro di pochi giorni a essere uccisa in questo modo incomprensibile e subito dilaga la psicosi. Il “mostro” della Liguria si chiama Donato Bilancia e ha già ucciso 14 volte. Le radici della sua follia affondano nella sua infanzia difficile, fatta di umiliazioni, abbandono e solitudine. Vi raccontiamo la sua storia. | Leonarda Cianciulli ha avuto un’infanzia difficile nell’Irpinia dei primi del Novecento. Maledetta da una madre che la rinnega e da una zingara che le annuncia la morte di tutti i suoi figli, dopo decine di aborti riesce a mettere al mondo tre maschietti e una femminuccia.Dedita all’arte dei tarocchi e a piccoli riti di stregoneria, la donna è continuamente tormentata da incubi in cui i suoi figli sono minacciati da spiriti maligni e negativi. Con l’avvento della Seconda Guerra Mondiale la Cianciulli, che intanto si è trasferita nella ricca cittadina di Correggio, si convince che sacrificare vite umane a Dio è l’unico modo per impedire al figlio maggiore di essere convocato al fronte. E così è ispirata a realizzare un tremendo piano diabolico con tanto di sorpresa finale…", 'chan_desc': 'Anche le più belle città italiane hanno un cuore di tenebra.
