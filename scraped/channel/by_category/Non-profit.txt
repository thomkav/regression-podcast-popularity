We’re releasing this episode a little earlier than we typically do, in hopes that those of you who are attending can tune in as you fly, drive or hike your way to Baltimore. For those of you who are unable to attend, we still have some great tips that you can apply to other conferences (and hopefully a future NRPA Annual Conference). We’re joined by Amanda Hersey, NRPA’s Director of Conferences aka the mastermind behind the event, and Matt Brubaker, NRPA’s Director of Marketing, who is the guru behind promoting the conference and responsible for sharing the many great things the conference has to offer. Amanda and Matt share some valuable insider tips on making the most of your time at the conference, things that are new to the conference this year and the events that you won’t want to miss (like Cal Ripken Jr.’s keynote speech or the NRPA Opening Reception sponsored by GameTime). We also chat about the things we’re all looking forward to this year in Baltimore, but one thing is certain: We can’t wait to see thousands of park and recreation professionals together in Charm City to learn, network and be inspired. Tune in to the episode below to make sure you don’t miss out on anything at the 2019 NRPA Annual Conference! And, be sure to stop by the Open Space Radio booth (#1519) in the exhibit hall to say hi, answer some questions on the microphone and get some pretty sweet Open Space Radio swag!

You’re wondering how the all-knowing internet knows you need this thing — but it does. And you do. That’s digital marketing. Digital marketing is any marketing that is done on a digital channel, such as, social media, mobile apps, email, websites, search engines — and even podcasts. Digital marketing can be a useful tool for park and recreation agencies that want to promote their programs, special events and other offerings to a broader audience. Letting your community know about the things you offer can be exciting — and increase the impact your agency makes — but it can also be a little overwhelming, whether you’re new to marketing or not, because there are just so many programs and services out there. On today’s episode, we’re joined by Stephen Gendreau, Director of Advertising and Media Operations for ACTIVE Network. ACTIVE Network — which provides digital marketing services, as well as event and participation management — is one of our partners for this year’s  Parks Build Community renovation of Catherine Street Park in Baltimore, Maryland. We chat with Stephen about what digital marketing means for parks and recreation, as well as the most important thing you need for your digital marketing efforts to succeed (hint: it’s data). Key takeaways from this episode:  Data and understanding your audience are essential to a successful digital marketing campaign and will help you deliver the right message to the right audience at the right time. Pixels — such as  Google Analytics or other analytics services — on your website can help you understand who is visiting your site and who is interested in specific offerings. Meeting your community where they are online (social media, search engines, etc.) can help you engage with audiences that are typically harder to reach. Don’t get complacent in your marketing efforts — just because something worked this time, doesn’t necessarily mean it will work in the future, and vice versa. Use the data you collect — rather than feelings or observations — to make your marketing decisions  To learn more about how to build and execute effective park and recreation marketing and communication campaigns that will help you better connect with your community, check out the  NRPA Marketing and Communications Certificate. And, if you’re going to be at the 2019 NRPA Annual Conference in Baltimore, be sure to attend the  Marketing Certificate Program pre-conference workshop! | In this episode we are taking on some listener requests for more podcasts on park and recreation programming (P.S. we’d love to hear your requests for episodes, so email Roxanne or Cort with your ideas!). Today, we’re looking at intergenerational programming – what it is, how it’s working in the field and how it’s impacting those who participate in the programs. We interviewed three people in order to collect these different perspectives and you’ll likely notice that our mics and audio sound a bit different interview to interview as they were done in different locations. First, you’ll hear from Emily Patrick of Generations United. She is dedicated to promoting and educating people about the benefits of intergenerational programs. Second, you’ll hear from Candice Holbrook from the Department of Parks, Recreation and Waterfront in Burlington, Vermont where she manages intergenerational programming. Third, you’ll hear from Martha Ahmed, an older adult who participates in intergenerational programming in Burlington. Some key takeaways from this episode:  Interactions between older adults and youth can provide mental and emotional health benefits to both groups and help with loneliness and isolation. Intergenerational programs can involve older adults serving youth, youth serving older adults, multiple generations working together to serve others, and an organization providing services to both groups at the same time. You can start intergenerational with the resources you have now — perhaps by combining activities between two existing programs. The intergenerational experience truly makes a positive impact on those involved.

That’s how much Kyle Giersdorf just  won at the Fortnite World Cup — a video game competition held at the Arthur Ashe tennis stadium in New York. That’s right. He won $3 million playing video games in a place typically reserved for the US Open. eSports, or video game competitions, isn’t new, but it is a  growing trend. So much so that eSports is starting to make a space for itself in the world of parks and recreation. Durango Parks and Recreation in Colorado, for example, has included large-scale, competitive video gaming in its draft master plan. Cort and I had the opportunity to chat about eSports with Neelay Bhatt — Vice President at PROS Consulting, NRPA board member, and an established thought leader in the field of parks and recreation. Our conversation stemmed from the speed session Neelay will be presenting this year at the NRPA Annual Conference in Baltimore titled, “eSports 101: Just What the Heck Is eSports and Why/How Should My Agency Participate in It?” In this episode we discuss what eSports is, its impact on parks and recreation and the potential opportunities it presents. | I think it’s fair to say that many times when people enter a career field, they do so with intentions of advancing in that career and continuing to progress, learn and grow. Of course, there are those moments of complacency that can creep up, and often we’re so busy with the work at hand that we don’t even think about the next steps in our career. Sometimes it’s just that taking that step toward your own professional development seems like a daunting task – especially if you don’t know where to start. On today’s episode, we’re joined by two people who know a thing or two about advancing in the field of parks and recreation. Joining us are Michael Kalvort, CPRE, the Recreation Services Director for City of Boca Raton, Florida, and Hayley Herzing, NRPA’s Senior Manager of Membership. Michael discusses some of the steps he took early in his career that set him up to be where he is today, including the importance of:  saying ‘yes’ to everything you can; certification; networking; mentorship; being part of a state or national association; and continuing to learn.  Hayley offers guidance on many of the resources NRPA provides to its members, such as:  NRPA Connect; the NRPA Annual Conference; professional development opportunities; certification opportunities; Volunteer opportunities, and more  | It’s no secret that working in parks and recreation comes with its share of unpredictable, funny moments. You must really be ready for anything — and many times these moments provide those deeply-satisfying laughs you can feel throughout your entire body (whether it’s instantly or one of those “this will be funny when we look back on it” moments). We’ve been asking you to share your funniest moments while on the job with us on our Instagram page, and the responses we’ve received are hilarious (we promise we’ve been laughing with you all). On this episode of Open Space Radio, we had the opportunity to chat with a few folks to get the full story behind their responses to our Instagram post. On this episode you’ll hear from: Eryn Mann, Marketing Coordinator, Henrico County Recreation and Parks (Virginia) Eryn shares about the time a traveling cat circus inquired about using one of their venues for a performance. Sadly, the request was not approved, but the Acro-Cats (and the Rock Cats — an all-cat rock band) appear to still be touring. Eryn also shared a couple other funny moments with us — the time she was chased by a cow during a farm animal Halloween photo shoot (the cow has been known to chase people) and the time she found a tree in one of their parks fitted with custom-made pants. Fun fact: Eryn’s only been with the department for two years — we have a feeling she’s in for some more funny moments! Nicole DiCicco, CPSI, Assistant Director, Dover Parks & Recreation (Massachusetts) Nicole shares about the time there was an accident in a very large tube slide (think poo emoji). According to Nicole, “there isn’t anything as funny as seeing two grown men having to squeeze into a (very stinky) tube slide AND one having to hold the other by the ankles to be able to reach the smeared mess to clean up!” The mess was from the very top of the slide all the way to the bottom of what Nicole describes as “the tallest playground.” This will most likely be a legendary story in Dover for years to come. Stephanie Harden, Center Director, Warren Road Community Center and T. Garrett Gymnasium (Georgia) Stephanie shares about the time that one of her summer campers was answering her phone. Although presumably embarrassing, Stephanie couldn’t help but laugh when she walked over to her phone to find the summer camper say, “No worries, Miss Stephanie — I answered all your calls, took messages and told everyone you were in the restroom!” As you can imagine, Augusta residents got a laugh — and according to Stephanie, everyone knows this summer camper and thought it was the funniest thing ever. You never really know what you’re going to get working with kids! And we couldn’t let a “funniest moments” podcast end without sharing a few of our own funniest moments while on the job. Roxanne reflects on the time a person in a gorilla costume was chasing a person in a banana costume through the Starbucks that she worked at, and Cort talks about the time he was called “Curt Johnson” repeatedly on a live interview (Cort Jones, Curt Johnson, same thing). We also reminisce on a hilarious video that NRPA staff put together back in 2015 to celebrate Park and Recreation Month! Tune in to the show to listen to hear the full story! | Happy Park and Recreation Month! Throughout July, we celebrate all of the great things that are happening in local parks and recreation centers nationwide. This year’s theme for Park and Recreation Month is Game On, and we’re excited to have some fun all month long! On today's episode we’re joined by SaulPaul, a musician with a message. SaulPaul was a keynote speaker at the 2018 NRPA Annual Conference in Indianapolis, and he’s back to help us celebrate Park and Recreation Month this year. On this episode, we chat with SaulPaul about why he decided to spread his “Be the Change” message to local park and recreation departments, and the work that he’s been doing in communities across the country to entertain, inspire and empower people. We also talk about why he feels parks and recreation is so vital to every community, as well as how he’s celebrating Park and Recreation Month! We also talk about the inspiration for the #ParkRecTwoStepChallenge, which is a video contest open throughout July encouraging people to get creative, active and have some fun! Tune in to the episode below to learn more — and find out how you can win weekly prizes and the chance to have SaulPaul come film the official Park Rec Two Step music video in your hometown!

Today we’re talking about cigarette butt litter, and how both Keep Tennessee Beautiful and Keep the Tennessee River Beautiful are doing their part in their state to reduce the amount of cigarette butt litter, which contains really toxic chemicals that can be detrimental to the environment. On today’s episode I’m joined by Missy Marshall, who is the executive director of Keep Tennessee Beautiful and serves on the board of directors for Keep America Beautiful (KAB). I’m also joined by Edmond McDavis III, affiliate services and training coordinator for Keep Tennessee Beautiful and Kathleen Gibi, Executive Director of Keep the Tennessee River Beautiful. Keep Tennessee Beautiful is a KAB affiliate whose mission is to\xa0inspire and educate Tennesseans to\xa0take action\xa0every day to improve and beautify their community environment, and Keep the Tennessee River Beautiful is the first KAB affiliate to focus solely on a river — the improvement, protection and preservation of the Tennessee River, specifically. Part of improving, protecting and preserving the river is to educate people about the harm that cigarette butt litter can cause to waterways and provide safe ways to dispose of cigarette butts. Tune in to the episode below to learn about how KAB’s Cigarette Litter Prevention Program is helping improve the Tennessee River and the communities along the river through the installation of cigarette butt litter stands that not only provide safe disposal, but also feature educational art on the outside. You’ll also learn how to get your own free cigarette litter stand from Keep America Beautiful!

And, in celebration of June being Pride Month, we’re talking specifically about LGBTQ+ inclusion in parks and recreation. In our research about LGBTQ+ issues and parks and recreation, we came across a blog by Jason Shriner, the marketing manager for the City of Manassas Park Department of Parks and Recreation right here in Virginia. Jason’s blog talks about some of his own experiences and how working in parks and recreation means being a leader in LGBTQ+ inclusion. Since he was right in our backyard, we invited Jason over to NRPA headquarters to pick his brain about inclusion and talk a little more about that blog. On this episode, Jason shares how he got into parks and recreation (spoiler: he and Roxanne share a deep-rooted love of baking), how his own journey has led him to being a leader in LGBTQ+ inclusion and why he thinks inclusion is so critical in parks and recreation. He also shares a few things that the City of Manassas Park Department of Parks and Recreation has done to ensure that its parks and facilities are more inclusive and welcoming to all, including:  Partnering with organizations like PFLAG (parents, families and friends of the LGBTQ+ community) and Team DC (an LGBTQ+ sports club in Washington, D.C.) Offering LGBTQ+ specific programs like yoga and self-defense Using gender-neutral and inclusive language in handbooks/policies Replacing gender-specific, single-stall bathrooms with all-gender bathrooms Adding sexual orientation and gender identity to agency’s non-discrimination policy  These are just a few of the amazing things that Jason has helped facilitate at his agency, so be sure to tune in below to learn more, as well as hear some small changes that you can make in your parks and facilities to ensure that everyone feels safe and welcome.

Family Health and Fitness Day is this Saturday, June 8, Olympic Day is June 23, and the entire month of July is Park and Recreation Month! With all of these celebrations in mind, we wanted to highlight the ways in which parks and recreation are part of creating a culture of fitness, as well as making sure that everyone has access to fitness opportunities, regardless of their abilities. Prepare to be inspired by today’s episode. We’re thrilled to be joined by Jennifer French, who has an amazing story of resilience after overcoming a snowboarding accident in 1998 in which she became a quadriplegic, to becoming a silver medalist representing Team USA at the 2012 Paralympic Games in sailing. We’re also excited to have Sam Mendelsohn, CEO of Greenfields Outdoor Fitness, which has been a leader in accessible outdoor fitness equipment since 2007. Greenfields Outdoor Fitness is also the sponsor of Family Health & Fitness Day, Park and Recreation Month and NRPA’s Parks Build Community. Jennifer shares her story with us and explains the challenges she faced after her injury, as well as how she had to adapt to continue living an active lifestyle. She also talks about the things she does to stay fit now and gives some tips for others who may be in a similar situation. Sam and Jennifer also talk about how they connected, and how Jennifer’s story inspired Sam’s work in creating accessible outdoor fitness equipment. Sam shares some of the trends he’s seeing related to accessibility and physical fitness in parks and recreation. They both agree there’s no one way to ensure that everyone in a community has the opportunity to get fit, regardless of physical or cognitive ability, and that getting the community involved is absolutely critical. No one knows the needs of a community more than the people living in that community. Listen to the full episode to learn more about Jennifer and Sam’s inspiring work — it may even inspire you to go out there and get fit!

But effectiveness is about going from outputs to outcomes." So says Charles Chandler, author and podcaster, who discusses his model for organizational sustainability and effectiveness. What makes a project and, by extension, an organization, truly effective and great? You must distinguish between "efficiency" and "effectiveness," and understand the importance of measuring effectiveness based on Outcomes (Uptake, Adoption, and Use) rather than Outputs. By looking at organizations as complex adaptive systems, it becomes clear that the true goal of all organizations is basically the same: to be effective in their particular environment. Rather than top-down goal-setting, the directives should ideally come from below, where team members are closer to the environment and customer interaction. Listen, learn, and get a free PDU!

We apologize for the inconvenience. | In this episode, Lillian Rivera, Executive Director of Hetrick-Martin New Jersey, talks about what inspires her, what brings her joy, and her hopes for our collective future.The song in this episode is "Garden" by Spazz Cardigan.Episode Transcriptjoi foley: I\'m joi foley, and I\'m your host for this episode of Rockwood\'s Leading From The Inside Out podcast.joi foley: The guest for this episode is Lillian Rivera. Lillian is the executive director of the Hetrick Martin Institute, New Jersey. She\'s a writer, advocate, youth ally, and a Latino lesbian wife and mother to two girls. With over a decades worth of experience in youth development, she has facilitated workshops and trainings across the country on working with LGBTQ youth, and was nominated for the Presidential Advisory Council in HIV/AIDS. She\'s written articles on her work and her life as a Latino lesbian mom for Huffington Post and Feminist Wire. She\'s an alum of the 2015 Fellowship for Racial and Gender Justice Leaders in the HIV/AIDS Movement. Lily joined me via video chat, and I asked her 10 questions about her leadership.joi foley: Can you share more about the kind of work that Hetrick Martin does?Lillian Rivera: Absolutely. Hetrick Martin Institute, and specifically Hetrick Martin Institute, New Jersey, where I\'m the ED, is nonprofit organization, and we serve LGBTQ youth. What we do is we have a unique model where we create the environment where LGBTQ youth are affirmed and nurtured in ways that they aren\'t in other spaces. So we have a youth development sort of do the same youth work that other adolescent providers do, just through the lens of LGBT affirmation. I like to go beyond inclusion. Right? I want to affirm and nurture our young people in order to have them internalize that they are whole, beautiful individuals that have a great life ahead of them, and their gender identity and sexual orientation and race and class, all of those things, are just facets of who they are and they\'re all beautiful and they all should be valued. And the rest of our work is really youth development work, giving young people the skills and the resources they need to thrive in their life.joi foley: Do you have any favorite moments or memories from your work there?Lillian Rivera: Yeah. We had the unique experience to be able to work with young people from the age of 13 to 21 in New York City. They worked with them until they\'re 24, so you see a huge progression in their growth. I think every time a young person reaches a milestone and they succeed around things that they thought they weren\'t going to succeed, it\'s a huge celebration. So they graduate high school, it\'s a great celebration, or they get their first job and they get their first paycheck. It\'s amazing. Or they get their name changed and they\'re affirmed in ways that they\'ve never been affirmed, or for some kids is just us saying to them, Oh, you want a binder or you need a binder? Sure, let\'s go to the pantry and get it.Lillian Rivera: And that one small thing just let\'s them move in the world in ways that are transformative. For another person, they might miss that opportunity, but we get to see all of that beauty, in terms of their growth and their blossoming, because we are affirming things that other people will alienate them around.joi foley: Do you ever get inspired by the youth that you work with?Lillian Rivera: Yeah, I am inspired every day. A lot of the young people that we work with are battling extreme poverty. I see their hope and their inspiration and I see their possibilities and I see them having that thirst for life that I think for me, someone who\'s been doing social services for so long, I could not have sustained myself if I weren\'t working with young people. I had the experience of working with adults in the past who were HIV positive and were either homeless, had a history of homelessness.Lillian Rivera: They\'re usually battling mental illness, managing the addiction, and it just really crushed my soul because the world had been so unfair to them. The world had not put anything in place to address the issues that they were dealing with, and that\'s when I knew I had to work with young people. I had to work with young people, one, because they are not cynical or bitter, regardless of their life situations. They are a light to follow. I also find that I make the best decisions when I let young people lead. They\'re on top of things. They understand things in the world that my 47 year old mind doesn\'t understand anymore and they\'re a constant inspiration to keep going, to be able to give them platforms to lift them up, open doors for them, because their ability to innovate and think of ways that older folks don\'t is new and vibrant.Lillian Rivera: I think I\'ve always relied on youth leadership, and the older I get, the more certain I am that I want young people making decisions. I want them not only making decisions about technology and the stuff that I don\'t understand, but I want them making decisions about the world in general. I want them to impact the environment, I want them to, because they\'re going to do things in innovative ways, like the glasses on my face. Right? My 10 year old picked out because I would\'ve never picked these out. But she\'s just like, yes, do it, go for it. I think that\'s what I get from young people every day. When I understand their world challenges and I understand that they\'re struggling with this and they\'re struggling with that and they\'re going to bust out this dope ass ... Sorry, this dope poetry that speaks about the future, that speaks about possibility, that speaks about like the beautiful many identities that they, you know, thrive in.joi foley: Why were you born for this time?Lillian Rivera: I think I was born for this time because I need it to be born working class. I needed to be born Puerto Rican. I needed to be born in New Jersey and I needed to figure out that I was a lesbian. And I needed to figure out all of those identities in order to create visibility for folks who look or sound like me or who come from where I come from or all of those important things. And I think the class issues that are surfacing today because of our current environment deserve the critical analysis that someone from my background brings forward. Right? And I think even in the nonprofit sector, I think I need to be there to challenge how these issues play out, right? I will often find myself amongst other nonprofit leaders, the only check off whatever box you want.Lillian Rivera: Right? So the landscape is changing. I think our role in society is changing as nonprofits and if we don\'t figure out how to sort of dismantle systems of oppression within our own organizations to be possibilities of hope within society, then we\'re going to become obsolete. So I think my lived experiences from a kid whose dad was a farmer and then became a factory worker and whose mom also worked in factories. Understanding what the unions did for our society. I think I need to be here talking about that as white presenting or red Latina. I need to be working on anti-blackness in the Latino community, right? And being the person of color in spaces where on some level I need to be the one doing that talking, using my privilege to do that talking. And I think LGBTQ youth needed me. They needed me to to say, hey, you are worthy and you are valuable and you are beautiful and the world is better because of you and we need to hear your stories.Lillian Rivera: Everyone needs to hear your stories. And I needed to be that messenger for some kids, some really valuable kids. And there\'s still a whole bunch of them that hopefully I\'ll get to talk to you.joi foley: What\'s on your heart?Lillian Rivera: Yeah. I think on my heart, what\'s on my heart today is, or at this time, is staying hopeful, stay hopeful and centered and in the community. I\'m lucky that I\'m in Newark, New Jersey, now, or Candor, New Jersey because Newark is a small city with big, big heart and getting, you know, I think in big cities like New York, you can get lost and lose sort of the connection to community. And in Newark it\'s what I need to keep going. Like I need to be in community with folks. I need to know that these conditions within our country will be over. I want to stay hopeful for the work and for my family.Lillian Rivera: And you know, just stay focused that this\'ll end, this too shall pass and we will be stronger for it and our voices will be the loudest.joi foley: Who is leading today that you\'d love to work with?Lillian Rivera: Well, you know, well anyone that I\'d want to work with, I think I\'ve got to the place where I\'m feeling just a little insular and I feel that because I need to take care of my community, right? I\'m feeling like I need to work with Latin x folks and I need to do that because the assault on us has been nonstop when Mexicans are called rapists. You\'re calling me one as well. You\'re calling my children one as well, calling all of my family one as well and I think I need to work with that community and I need to be there for our folks.Lillian Rivera: I think we don\'t have the national infrastructure to be able to say, hey, let\'s have this convening and do this as you know, as Latin X folks. But I think some of us are working to do that and to stay connected and to take care of ourselves. And you know, I love hearing about what other leaders are doing in the Latino, Latina, Latinx community. I love hearing what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing and because I think she gives me hope and possibility, because she\'s in there fighting our fight. So I\'m working with Elicia who is another Rockwood fab person. So staying in community, building those networks, making sure that we\'re taking care of each other. And you know, we do a lot of healing. Justice is where I think our community is right now. Like I said before, these assaults are too great for us not to be impacted by them.Lillian Rivera: So how are we going to heal from this and how are we going to create and sustain a healing network for ourselves?joi foley: What was most memorable about your Rockwood experience?Lillian Rivera: I think the most memorable transformative thing about my Rockwood experience is one that I understood myself as a leader. Ah wow. Right? When society tells me lots and lots of things that I\'ve internalized, right? Working Class, Puerto Rican, lesbian from Jersey City. That\'s not a leader, right? That\'s what I thought. But I am. Right? And people reflecting that onto me helped me internalize that. So not only did I learn, but I internalized and I created that expectation for myself, which is beautiful, right? You\'re going to lead. Does everybody believe that you\'re a leader? Doesn\'t matter. Are there things that you need to say in this world that are important that may impact people\'s lives.Lillian Rivera: That\'s what matters, right? Is there space you need to create to welcome everybody? That\'s what matters. Are there connections that you can make to build community? That\'s what matters? So I think me internalizing that I\'m a leader and me connecting with such beautiful people that were in the same spaces I was, right? Our cohort for our leadership too, was really focused on HIV around race and gender. And these people are incredible thinkers. Incredible, have incredible big hearts. People who are doing work in places where it can be dangerous to do the work and they do it anyway. Building that community for myself, people is invaluable. And then knowing that, you know, we\'re part of a legacy of folks who have been through Rockwood who are changing the world. That\'s a little scary, right? That\'s a little scary. Like what\'s my contribution to this?Lillian Rivera: But it\'s beautiful and in inspires and I can\'t tell you how many people that I\'ve said to have you gone to Rockwood? Do you know about Rockwood? Like so many people that I come across that I see could really benefit from the space and the knowledge that\'s shared in the community that\'s built in the moments that transform us during a Rockwood training.joi foley: What message would you want to share with future generations?Lillian Rivera: I\'d want to share with them that we\'re living in a really horrible time and that we are able to come together. And the most important thing about the coming together is that the coming together today is happening with people not in segregated communities but from all communities. Right? We all care about black lives matter. There\'s no sort of qualifications for that. Bottom line. Black lives matter. We all care that children shouldn\'t be separated from their families.Lillian Rivera: Families belong together, we all care about that, we all care that black trans women should be killed, we all care about that. And we\'re coming together across class, across race, across sexual orientation and gender identity. And we\'re coming together, this horrible time has taught us how to come together, build community, take care of ourselves, and really strive towards that nation that we know we could have. So if we can do it now in this really difficult time, there\'s no holding back what future generations can think about in terms of possibility, all sorts of possibilities, right? What does equitable language look like besides the things we\'re thinking about now in terms of condominiums, that sort of thing. There\'s a lot of possibility for generations to come and hopefully they\'re able to inhabit our planet because we haven\'t ruined it to the point where they can\'t.Lillian Rivera: But I would say to future generations to pay close attention to the history that we\'re making today.joi foley: What has changed or shaped your leadership?Lillian Rivera: I think all of who I am. Right? Where I come from. And I think the idea is that, you know, I grew up in Jersey City in sort of the area that has been gentrified, but when I was growing up here in the 70s it was the bad area. Right? I think about like my brothers and cousins talking about, I don\'t understand why they felt it was the bad area. Right? And it was the bad area because my brother and his friends were walking around with a basketball. Right? And that\'s why it was the bad area because the Puerto Ricans came in and the black people came in. I mean, that\'s why it became a bad area. And my leadership was shaped when my parents took me out of this area and moved me into a predominantly white area.Lillian Rivera: And I saw the differences and I experienced the stereotyping and I experienced sort of the lower expectations of people of color and I experienced how our lives are so different and how my difference was not welcomed. And I think that\'s what really shoot, I think in my heart, I feel that the world should be just always for everyone, regardless of whether I agree with them or like them or whatever. I just feel like it should be just, and maybe that\'s the Libra in me, right? We should be just the people. And as I grew up, I\'ve always had a sense of who I was in the world and who I was to other people in the world, specifically the ruling class in this country. And I also have an amazing brother who\'s a social anthropologist, and he conditioned me very young to be a feminist.Lillian Rivera: So I was really young when I received this branch and I was like, why am I reading this? I really don\'t understand. So he really worked to make sure that I knew my foremothers, that I knew the women who were paving the path for me and having sort sort of the [inaudible] and be able to say, hey, this is wrong, or we have to change this in order to make space for people. And I think the most recent sort of impact on my leadership is becoming apparent. As a parent, there is nothing I want more than for our daughters to be whole people and to stand in their strength and be able to make the choices that they want in life. And for no one to tell them that they can\'t. And I want that for their friends as well. They should have that as well, all of their friends.Lillian Rivera: So I think I fight a little stronger now because it\'s not as abstract. It\'s about these children that I love and I\'m going to, you know, call out or invite in whoever I need to to make sure that children are okay in kindergarten being who they are. It\'s okay for this boy to wear a pink skirt. It\'s okay. This is not the problem. Right? The fact that the child may not have dinner at night, that\'s the problem. Right? And how we have those conversations. So I think there\'s a lot of things that sort of shaped who I was. I also like come from a long line of women who have been really strong and have stood up for what the believed in. So I want that for my girls to know that as well. And believe it or not, I think, and this might not be a popular opinion these days, my Catholic upbringing, I am one of those fortunate kids who had a positive experience in Catholic school and all of the values that the nuns taught me around community, around giving back around how we live our lives are ingrained.Lillian Rivera: I\'m not a practicing Catholic. I will never be a practicing Catholic again. But those values are essential to the choices I make in life and the values that I won\'t compromise around because I believe that people should be housed. And I believe that people should have access to healthcare. And I believe that people should have food. And I believe regardless of their contribution to our workforce, right? Like that\'s what I believe and that will never change. So I think there\'s a lot of things that have influenced my leadership. And I have to say also the young people that I\'ve worked for for almost 17 years, they not only inspired me to be the best person I can be. They also taught me that ... So I worked with a lot of ballroom children and they taught me that the world is a runway that we could choose to sort of sulk and hide away from the world.Lillian Rivera: We can pick up our chin and do a fierce front way anywhere in the world and be okay and be celebrated.joi foley: What brings you joy?Lillian Rivera: What brings me joy? My children definitely. My family definitely brings me joy. If I could be with them 24/7, I would be with them. They make me laugh, they make me, they make me ... I feel safety with them, right? My entire family. I feel safe. I love that our youngest is a defiant little thing. I love that our oldest constantly sings musical theater. Like I love who they are as people. I love and I can argue about politics with my brother. I love that, you know, my wife is just part of who I am, like in my heart. Like she\'s just the, the Rock in our family. I love that. You know, my other brother, plays the congas and makes me laugh till I can\'t breathe anymore.Lillian Rivera: Like, I love and get so much joy by being with my family. I also get a lot of joy by writing. Writing brings me a lot of joy to write my stories, and get them out there and have people you know, wonder about where does this stuff come from? How is this possible? It\'s awesome because I exist, right? So I think that brings me great joy. Playing video games, it brings me joy because it\'s a challenge and I love challenges. Ooh, cooking food and feeding people brings me great joy. That\'s sort of the Puerto Rican tradition and it\'s almost meditative for me to make food for folks. So I think there\'s a lot of things that bring me joy.joi foley: That\'s all for this episode of leading from the inside out.

We will also be experimenting with different types of content alongside the alum interviews, so if there’s something you’d like Rockwood to cover in this podcast, just let us know. With that, here’s our show.joi foley: Our guest for today’s episode is alum Zahra Billoo. Zahra is executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, San Francisco Bay Area office, the oldest and one of the largest CAIR chapter offices. Under Zahra’s leadership, CAIR-SFBA has filed lawsuits against the United States Department of Justice, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Southwest Airlines representing American Muslims facing discriminatory treatment. CAIR-SFBA has also significantly expanded its capabilities to provide know-your-rights sessions on a nearly weekly basis to mosques and community members in the San Francisco Bay Area while also providing direct legal representation to Bay Area residents facing numerous civil rights violations.joi foley: Zahra has appeared on MSNBC, NPR, and the San Francisco Chronicle, and even on Fox News. She was a speaker at the historic Women’s March in Washington, DC in January 2017. Zahra received the 2017 Human Rights Award from the Society of American Law Teachers and was featured in the January 2018 Chronicle of Philanthropy cover story on how millennials lead. Outside of her work with CAIR, Zahra bakes birthday cakes for foster children through Cake4Kids and is a coordinator for Project Feed, a monthly homeless feeding effort in downtown San Francisco. Zahra is currently in Rockwood’s Lead Now California Fellowship, but she’s been through a few fellowships and programs with us. When I spoke with Zahra in February at our office in Oakland, our conversation started there.joi foley: Okay, so the first question is you’ve been through two Rockwood Fellowships, but you’ve been total eight sessions, we counted, so why do you keep returning to Rockwood?Zahra Billoo: I was initially introduced to Rockwood by other leaders who said, “Look, we see the path that you’re going down, and we know that you’re going to need help to sustain yourself and the work that you’re doing in the long run. Why don’t you check out Rockwood?” That was my first introduction to The Art of Leadership. After that, I was invited to join a Fellowship, and what I appreciated about the opportunity to do a Fellowship was that it wasn’t just training. It was training plus community, and so the relationships, the friendships that I made in my participation during Fellowship for a New California are still people I rely on, I call, and that I’m excited to see when I’m at events and out doing this work.Zahra Billoo: Fast-forward several years, and we have the 2016 election. It’s not like civil rights and human rights weren’t already challenging before the 2016 election, but the problems became so much more exaggerated. So much of the deep-rooted racism and white supremacy in our country was unveiled, and the pace at which many of us that were already in the work had to change to was just unprecedented. When the opportunity to do another Fellowship and meet new people doing this work in this moment and relearn some of the Rockwood practices came about, I couldn’t say no. Just a couple of days ago when I was thinking through how to process a trigger, I was so grateful for all of the training that I’ve done with Rockwood now.joi foley: Do you have any favorite memories of any of your Rockwood experiences or moments that were really important to you?Zahra Billoo: I remember one of the nights of the Fellowship parties where there was a particular one in the second, in the Lead Now Fellowship, where everybody just let loose. Whether people were drinking or not, and I don’t drink, they were having a good time. They were talking. They were in community. It was interesting because I remember having a conversation with someone about life while dating as a single Muslim woman and also having a conversation with someone about gender pay equity and then breaking a sweat on the dance floor. That combination of experiences in one night, for me, was so much the epitome of the family that Rockwood helps cultivate where we can talk about work and life and have fun.joi foley: Why were you born for this time?Zahra Billoo: I sometimes contemplate why I was born with as much privilege as I was born with. I didn’t necessarily earn the rights that I have. They are a function of where I was born, who I was born to, and those circumstances. I’m a US citizen who speaks English fluently and has a passport so can’t be sent anywhere I don’t want to go. I’ve got a voice that sometimes won’t shut up and a roof over my head as well as incredibly supportive family. When I think of why I was born for this moment, for me, it’s about putting all of those privileges to work. I didn’t earn them, and so the best that I can do is ensure that I don’t act like they are mine exclusively but rather that they are tools and an opportunity for service, and now is when we need it.joi foley: What’s in your heart?Zahra Billoo: I think what my heart is trying to figure out is how does one find happiness, and peace, and contentment, and companionship in this moment where there’s literally a rapid-fire every day. Maybe they existed before, but it’s also the onslaught of social media and the 20-minute news cycle that has us going a mile a minute, and so what does our work look like? What do our lives look like in 2030 and in 2040 which, right now, feels frightening to even contemplate when many of us are dreading 2020?joi foley: Yeah. Who is leading today that you’d love to work with?Zahra Billoo: One of the blessings of the 2016 election, for me, has really been to develop new friendships in movement spaces and also to watch and support as leadership emerges in ways that we didn’t expect. If I were to think of individuals that I already know and love and want to deepen my work with, I think of so many of the women in movement spaces, Manar Waheed at ACLU, Linda Sarsour with Women’s March, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar in Congress, Marielena at NILC, and so many other bold, fierce women who I’m in awe of because they make leadership accessible, they connect work to efforts to empower community, and they don’t back down.joi foley: What message do you want to share with future generations?Zahra Billoo: I want people to understand that this is the work of lifetimes. Realistically, I’m not sure if we will free Palestine, or end poverty, or close the prison industrial complex in my lifetime. When I think of what I want future generations to understand is that they are not alone, they are not the first, and that we did the best that we could so that they would have it better.joi foley: Sometimes I think about, when I was younger, gay marriage seemed like it would never ever happen. Then, by the time it happened, I … it wasn’t like I wasn’t blasé about it, but I was like, “Oh, yeah, of course.” It was only a span of like 20 years or something that it-Zahra Billoo: But gay marriage isn’t just about legislation either, right?joi foley: Yeah.Zahra Billoo: It’s also about the shift in the narrative around people were being criminalized for who they love. Homes were being raided. Much of that continues, and so I don’t think of the fight for equality for any people as simply about legislation but rather like, hey, every step forward is progress. I mean I remember when Ellen came out on TV and when Will & Grace was still a little bit unusual, and now it’s like they’re doing new episodes of Will & Grace, all of a sudden, after a sort of a very long hiatus. We’re seeing small steps towards progress for Palestine, for people in prisons, but what’s hard is sometimes it’s one step forward, two steps back, and that’s the most heartbreaking thing.Zahra Billoo: I think what I really struggle with is this thing that we’ve been saying since the election, which is that the system isn’t broken. Trump was not elected because the system was broken. Trump was elected because the system works exactly as it was supposed to, and so how do we, for the purposes of our lifetimes but also future generations, balance working within a system that we acknowledge to be corrupt and faulty while also attempting to build something new in parallel?joi foley: Yeah. What has changed or shaped your leadership?Zahra Billoo: Learning from my mistakes has always been an important way in which I acknowledge the opportunity to grow. It’s not easy to fall on your face and then have to pick right back up because it’s not like the work is done or have time to recover, but I try really hard to see challenges as opportunities for growth.Zahra Billoo: The other thing that I would say that’s been really important is to have people who I trust that I can call for advice. That’s been, at times, board members, at times peers, people I’ve met through Rockwood, and friends in the work where I’ll call and say, “Hey, can you help me get my head on straight? This is how I’m feeling about XYZ. Is this right?” It’s not always easy to be told that you’re wrong, but to have people who can do that gently and compassionately and also confidentially is so critical because sometimes it’s also … As much as I want to embrace errors as opportunities for growth, which I believe they are, we don’t have, always, the flexibility to fail in movement spaces or in nonprofit spaces where mistakes can cost grant money or relationships or impact someone’s life individually.joi foley: Yeah. What brings you joy?Zahra Billoo: My nieces. I have two nieces who are three and a half and one and a half. They smile, and babble, and laugh, and make faces all while having no idea that the world is on fire outside their house. I think about doing this work for them so that they, like me, who were born as Muslim women, as girls of color in the United States with at least the comfort of US citizenship can do more and accomplish more than I could. It’s also simply the case that a child’s laughter, particularly when you don’t have to ever clean up their diapers, is so incredible. My brother calls every once in a while when the kids are being rowdy and they’ll … they know that I’m on the other side of the phone. I will drop everything to take that call. It doesn’t matter what I’m doing because they remind me that I’m doing this work for them but also that joy is possible.joi foley: Yeah. I think that just the phrasing of joy is possible is … it’s like it’s both present and future, and you can work towards it.Zahra Billoo: Yes, yes.joi foley: That’s what came up for me when you said that. Other than joy, or maybe it is joy, but what’s needed now?Zahra Billoo: I would say that what is needed now, well, there’s a long list of things, but what comes to mind for me is sustenance. A lot of people, including a lot of Rockwood alums, are operating at a pace that they haven’t before. It’s go, go, go. I lose track of how many 12-hour days I have, and that is not sustainable in the long run. What sustainability might require is more funding, more people finding careers in the movement, more people thinking about how to make this work lifestyle work, so even if you’re not in the movement, are you donating regularly? Are you going to the efforts regularly? Are you bringing joy to the lives of people who are in the movement full time to help them sustain?Zahra Billoo: I’d say that another thing that comes to mind for me around what’s needed is high-quality work, is that there isn’t room. There should be room. I know Rockwood teaches us that there should be room for F-ups, but some F-ups are just too consequential. Some resources are too limited, and so I wonder how we train people to do high-quality, high-quantity work and reward them for that.Zahra Billoo: The additional thing that comes to mind, for me, around what’s needed is unity. Many people in a movement will say unity is not uniformity. We don’t have to agree on everything, but we have to agree on basic human rights and civil rights for all people, and if we can’t, then get out of the way of the work. I want to see our movements be really strong. For example, it’s been really disheartening to see some of the attacks on the Women’s March, but then it’s been really powerful to see people step up and say, “Hey, we’re in this together, right? So get with it or get out of the way, and we’re going to continue to do that work.” There’s lots and lots of examples of this every day, but to ensure that we don’t play into the hands of white supremacists, or war mongers, or misogynists, or anyone else trying to break up our movements by allowing ourselves to be divided.joi foley: Yeah. I find that a lot of my work now, my personal work, is helping my friends realize the stories that are kind of swimming around them. They can dig down to what’s true.Zahra Billoo: That’s so true. I think about that with so many with … any time I carry a privilege and I’m hearing a conversation among my circles about a group that doesn’t have that same privilege, right? What’s one that comes up for me sometimes is I am a cisgendered heterosexual woman, and conversations about gay marriage, gay rights, trans rights, public restroom safety, any of those things, to stop those conversations sometimes and say, “Hey, let’s make sure that we’re operating from a place of empathy. Let’s make sure that we understand our privilege in this moment, and then let’s see what the most impacted people are saying,” has sometimes been the work of allyship that I can do. Similarly, people ask me sometimes, “Well, what do I say to my racist grandma?” I’m like, “Keep having conversations with her because I’m not invited to her house.”joi foley: Yeah, and I think this ties into what we’re talking about: How do you practice resilience online and off?Zahra Billoo: The first hate piece about me was when I was in law school, and it was because Daniel Pipes, so decades-long notorious anti-Muslim activist, had been protested at a location 400 miles away from where I was, and all I had done was send out an email encouraging people to join a protest that someone else was organizing. All of a sudden, I got credit for organizing the whole protest, and they went through my blog, and they went through my Facebook, and they went through the meeting minutes for student government meetings I had been in to put together these dossiers about me, and I didn’t even know that Twitter was around yet.Zahra Billoo: What I learned, at that time, was a few things. One was limit what you read for your self-care, right? Look, haters going to hate. How much of that do I need to read? How much of that do I need to consume? I need to be aware, just as I am with in-person interactions and who triggers me, what the cost of these things is. Sometimes, being unaware is better than being drained. I think of people that trigger me and the resolutions I’ve made to just be like, “Your email always is harassing and bullying, and I’m just not reading it anymore because you don’t get to do that to me.” I think of that.Zahra Billoo: Other parts that I learned around that were that it was so important that I developed my own content, that if someone wanted to know who Zahra Billoo was that the first find that they would have was not a hate monger’s website about me. That’s easier said than done with all of the SEO things that I don’t even understand.Zahra Billoo: The last thing was that … This is going to sound a little bit ridiculous maybe. I don’t know. There is something to be said about how effective you are when the haters come for you, right? I don’t want to trivialize how terrifying it can be because it can be, right? I live in a secure apartment complex, and no one has my address, right? I have friends who have had to hire security and put up cameras, but there’s still something telling about, look, if Fox News is praising you, then you’re probably doing it all wrong. Challenging the status quo, the powers that be, and people who perpetuate oppression, for me, is not just about resilience. It’s prophetic. It’s what the leaders that I look up to did and paid a price for, but I recognize that I stand on their shoulders.Zahra Billoo: You know, I also make regular time to hang out with friends. I eat ice cream nearly daily when I’m not dieting. If I’m dieting, I’m eating fruit-on-the-bottom Greek yogurt, but there’s still sugar because that has an impact. I go to the gym because that does things for my adrenaline. I vacation regularly. These nieces are a place that I visit, that I see, that I call, and so it’s also just important that people figure out what brings them joy and what that looks like and then prioritize that.Zahra Billoo: I know one of the hardest things, for me, about going on vacation, for example, is how do I turn of my brain and stop checking my emails? Usually, it’s like midway through vacation by the time I have accomplished that, and then it’s over, which motivates me to plan my next one. It’s not easy to come under attack as many people are more frequently these days but, in some ways, it’s almost the cost of doing this work.joi foley: That’s all for this episode of Rockwood’s Leading From The Inside Out podcast.

But you have to know how to use it effectively. Part of that is avoiding the mistakes that can cost your time, money and frustration. Today’s episode is about Cindy’s Top 10 (or should we say “Bottom 10”) email mistakes you don’t want your nonprofit to make. | Often the “thank you” message after a donation is received is seen as the end of a transaction. You reach out to current supporters or attract the attention of new ones, they give to your organization and you thank them. It’s the polite thing to do. But that approach, treats your organization’s acknowledgement of a donation as the end of the conversation, when actually it’s just the beginning - or continuation - of a beautiful friendship. | Today’s podcast takes a deep dive into the data driving email-based fundraising. It includes the highlights from several highly respected reports, but it’s not just a list of endless statistics. Instead, Cindy shares what her 20+ years in marketing tells her are the meaning behind those numbers - and why they should matter to you. | One of the biggest fundraising successes a nonprofit client of mine achieved was done without an event or a fundraising mailer. It was an effort that raised more than $25,000 in just 10 days through emails - and turned into a feel-good movement that exceeded our wildest expectations. This podcast pulls back the curtain on how it was done - and how you could do it too. | Email campaigns can be a powerful addition to your nonprofit’s fundraising, but one of the keys to their success is the names and email addresses on your email list. Are they up to date? Are they segmented into the proper categories? Today Cindy goes into the steps your nonprofit should take to make your email list “fundraiser ready.” Armed with a properly organized list, you’ll have more confidence when you reach out to ask for support for your cause | What grade would you give your emails as a fundraising tool? B-minus or C or even lower? Fundraising by email can be the perfect way to give your bottom line a boost without the hassle and cost of a big event. Even better, you can turn lackluster email fundraising into a grade "A" campaign by using one of the three proven methods discussed in this week’s podcast. Plus, I’ve got a gift - my free\xa0Ultimate 2-week ($2K-$10K) Email Fundraising Campaign Starter Kit\xa0to take what you learn in this podcast and make it actionable right away. Happy fundraising! | Today we’re revisiting a conversation I had with Liz Melville who is a highly regarded Facebook ads and marketing specialist. So sit back and take a listen to a Marketer on a Mission podcast revisited as Liz shares some golden nuggets about using Facebook Ads to help move your mission forward. | Even though your nonprofit isn’t a huge commercial venture like Nike or McDonald’s you still need branding to successfully communicate your value - both to current supporters and the public at large. Because just like the Nike swoosh makes you think ‘Just Do It’ and the McDonald’s arches make you crave a Big Mac & Fries, your brand should be a super quick way of saying who you are and what you stand for. A style guide and consistent use of the logos, color and messaging that’s all part of your brand, helps amplify the message that you are a trustworthy and worthwhile agent of change - because you are! | An old-school method of reaching out to current supporters and prospects is gaining traction in the nonprofit world. It’s not a new app, digital platform or mobile solution. Are you ready? It’s postcards. (Yes, postcards). Snail mail is making a comeback in a big way. And with response rates to mailers rising and production costs falling, it’s worth considering as a part of your marketing mix. | Are you a marketing follower, or a marketing leader? When your board dismisses marketing efforts on behalf of your nonprofit, do you meekly follow their direction or\xa0gently\xa0persuade them about the value marketing offers your nonprofit, your supporters and your clients? It took me a while to become a marketing leader, and I wish someone had taken me aside earlier in my career and shared what I talk about today.', 'chan_desc': 'How do I market my nonprofits mission with heart not hype?

But to know the history you need to talk with Marc Schafer, CEO of Truliant, a Winston Salem credit union.That\'s because Truliant was sued by a banker\'s group in the mid 1990s that claimed it was illegal for a credit union to serve more than one employer group.\xa0 And the bankers won in the Supreme Court!So how is it now legal? Listen to Schaefer and his tale of how HR 1151 became law - that\'s the legislation that made multiple SEGs legal.Along the way you will hear a great personal credit union success story. Schafer became CEO of the tiny FDIC credit union when he was 34 in 1986.\xa0 In 1995 he moved to Truliant which then was a $400 million credit union.Truliant now is a $2.5 billion credit union.That\'s a remarkable growth story and of course you want to hear it.Why is Schafer telling his story now? He retires at year end.His is a terrific story of how to make credit unions work better, for more people.Related podcasts in this series include Bucky Sebastian (who tells his take on HR 1151), Gary Oakland, Jim Blaine, and Teresa Freeborn.As for Blaine, the retired CEO of SECU in North Carolina, he too has a story of being sued over multiple SEGs.\xa0 In an email he wrote this: "few know that the "original" FOM law suit was filed against SECU in state court (SECU is state-chartered) in 1977 by the NC Bankers Association when SECU added small city/county local govts to our FOM. The bankers beat us in the NC Supreme Court (on a split decision with the Chief Justice writing an \'icy\' dissent!) and we had to divest about 9,000 local govt employees who had joined. We did so - being the ornery, stubborn folks we were! - by forming a federal credit union (today\'s Local Government FCU @$2.5 billion) which immediately contracted for all services through SECU. LGFCU had a board and staff of 1, but immediately had a full array of services and about 50 branches at that time!\xa0 Needless to say our state bankers were \'not pleased\' and sued in federal court (we forced it out of our state courts since LGFCU was federally chartered!). LGFCU/SECU won on appeal in the 3rd District (Richmond) and the bankers decided not to appeal to the US Supreme Court. When they later came gunning for Marc, the bankers made sure it got heard in the 4th District (DC) which is far more \'business friendly\' - the 4th ruled in favor of the banks, which led to the adverse Supreme Court decision, the Campaign for Consumer Choice, and HR 1151." | You have your eye on new ATMs for your credit union - but you are given pause by the price tags that can quickly jump above $50,000 apiece.Here\'s a reality: most credit union ATMs that I see are old, creaky, lacking functions, sometimes with screens so weathered and scratched they are barely readable.Then there are the ATMs that I see at nearby Chase\'s.

Pronto | Buckle up for big, explosive ideas.\xa0 That\'s what Douglas Hartung - senior director, business development & alliances at Diebold Nixdorf - specializes in and in this podcast he discusses Libra, bringing financial services to the globe\'s underbanked and unbanked, and the exciting idea that just maybe all a person needs to send money anywhere on the planet is a smart phone.How cool is that?Know that just may be Libra\'s promise.While some scoff at the prospects of Libra - the Facebook backed new-style currency - Hartung believes that the sheer magnitude of the Facebook family of properties user base makes this a financial play that demands attention.He also likes the idea of in-app payments - so in Facebook, for instance, what if you can without friction send $10 to a friend in Bali. With just a click. Without leaving the Facebook app.Is Libra just another Bitcoin variant? Hartung says nope.\xa0 He tells why in the podcast.A bottomline here is: pay attention to Libra.\xa0 You may regret it if you don\'t.Incidentally you will hear some taps interspersed throughout the podcast. That\'s Hartung animatedly tapping on a table to emphasize his point. Get into his spirit, let the taps animate you too.This podcast is one of a group of four recorded on site at the Diebold Nixdorf DN Intersect conference in Las Vegas, September 2019.Don\'t miss a related podcast with industry analyst Richard Crone, also on Libra.\xa0Like what you are hearing?

It\'s a journey every credit union needs to take. Pronto | Richard Crone is a longtime payments geek and when it comes to Libra, he has a particular spin.\xa0 It boils down to this: forget the talk about crypto currency. Libra fundamentally is a pre-paid account and because it is a Facebook effort, it has reach into some 2.1 billion daily users of Facebook tools (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.)."It\'s a prepaid network with global reach - there are also 90 million businesses on Facebook properties," said Crone.His blunt message: every credit union needs a Libra strategy and you need it now.Understand this: Facebook may not be looking to profit off Libra per se. Its strategy seems instead to be to use Libra to drive traffic to Facebook sites and thereby increase advertising revenues.Which may make Libra yet more attractive to financial institutions.The conversation includes Heidi Liebenguth, managing partner at Crone Consulting, and it took place in a public space at Caesars Palace, where Crone and Liebenguth were speakers at DN Intersect, the Diebold Nixdorf meeting. There\'s minor ambient noise but audio quality of the podcast is good.Crone finds it "bizarre" that not one FDIC insured institution joined in the launch of Libra.He also is not deterred by the regulatory scrutiny Libra has won.\xa0 In fact he sees it as a competitive advantage because it may deter competitors from plunging in with their own similar products.Listen to this podcast and you definitely will want to dig into Libra and reach the decisions that are right for your credit union. Inaction is not a strategy.Don\'t miss a related podcast with Diebold Nixdorf executive Douglas Hartung, also on Libra. \xa0Like what you are hearing?

How many recurring payments does a typical consumer have set up, for how much money monthly?Alain Glanzman, CEO of fintech WalletFi is focused on exactly that issue - and also on the huge potential it represents for credit unionsThe answers are 10 to 15 recurring payments totaling $857 per month.Surprised? Think Netflix, T-Mobile, the NY Times, Cox Cable, maybe an electric bill, and the list goes on.\xa0 We have moved from a society that paid via bill pay, or perhaps writing a check, to one where many of us have set up multiple vendors to in effect pay themselves monthly via our debit or credit cards.Enter WalletFi. The company says of itself: "WalletFi was founded to solve a problem our co-founders personally felt: the pain that comes from a lost or reissued card. Focused on the customer experience first, WalletFi grew to provide technology that helps users manage their subscriptions and recurring charges, and bounce back from a lost, stolen, or reissued card.\xa0Financial institutions identified these pain points in their customer’s life cycles as well, and now rely on WalletFi to provide a subscription management platform that will increase interchange revenue, offer an unbeatable user experience, and win the battle for top-of-wallet."WalletFi now is looking for credit unions to partner with.In this podcast, Glanzman offers intriguing insights into how fintechs and credit unions can work together, how they have different definitions of a "quick deal," and - above all - he expresses confidence that many credit unions, with their focus on the member experience, are ideally positioned to champion bringing more control to consumers over their recurring payments.On which note: do you know how many recurring payments you have set up?\xa0Don\'t be surprised if you stumble. That\'s where WalletFi comes in. It gives the member visibility into payments many of us have forgotten about.Like what you are hearing? Find out how you can help sponsor this podcast here.

Pronto | Circle the date, October 26. Las Vegas. That\'s when Susan Mitchell, a longtime credit union consultant, is convening another meeting of the Credit Union Underground, this time in parallel with Money 20/20, probably the meeting of the best and brightest in the disruptive quadrant of financial services. \xa0The point of each Underground is collision with disruptors. A lot - maybe most - credit union executives cling to their individual comfort zones. But get with reality. Maybe half of today\'s 5500 credit unions will go poof in the next decade.Bye bye.At the Undergrounds, attendees get exposed to disruptive thought - but they also see they aren\'t required to face the challenges alone, a lot of credit union people are in the same boat.A Mitchell belief is that widespread cooperation helped build the credit union industry. And a renewed commitment to cooperation just may be its salvation.Ask yourself this: what\'s your institution\'s purpose? Who did you help today? Whose life did you change?Credit unions were created to help community members, to change lives. Are they still doing that?And know that that is a path to survival.

Aren\'t they technology deserts in an era of digital banking? Nope. Not with CU*Answers, the CUSO Karnes helms, at their side.\xa0 CU*Answers once was simply a core system provider but as the technology needs of credit unions have evolved, so has CU*Answers.\xa0 It now offers online banking, mobile banking, and more; you want to hear why in this podcast.178 credit unions own CU*Answers and they range in size from microscopic to over $1 billion in assets.\xa0 The typical CU*Answers credit union is $80 to $100 million in assets and, say many pundits, that\'s an endangered species.\xa0Karnes dissents. "I don\'t think they will be gone."He adds, "Credit unions will survive to the extent they stay creative and disruptive."Remember that. The point of a credit union is not to be staid and conservative.

To see if there might be a chance that the donors want to make a difference for your organization, institution, school or charity. Well, increasingly, those conversations will happen with numerous members of the donor\'s family or even \'s financial planners. Arlene Cogen used to be a financial planner, someone who was really focused on amassing money for her clients. Then, she left financial planning and became a fundraiser. She began to really talk to fundraisers about how to engage financial planners and found that fundraisers don\'t need to be afraid, and financial planners can engage with their clients about how to increase philanthropy and find joy in giving. I got on the line with Arlene to talk a little bit about her book and the way she suggests people should engage donors, their families and their financial planners in the 21st century. Read Arlene\'s book, Give to Live And find out how she helps organizations truly inspires donors: https://www.arlenecogen.com/ \xa0 | Philanthropy is more than money. It\'s more than values. It\'s all the other ideas and time of the things that they bring, and this is becoming more and more critical as we look at the younger generations. We spend a lot of our time in the fundraising world thinking about how we can better connect to donors, how we can make the ask better, how we can engage donors, how we can increase their passion for giving. But we\'re probably not spending enough time thinking about how we work, how we can work more effectively, and how we behave as leaders. Well, Larry Johnson knows this and he\'s written a book called The Eight Principles, and has a really great training program and opportunities for fundraisers to really think about how they\'re developing as leaders. He\'s actually somebody who knew Stephen Covey himself and I got on the line with them to talk about The Eight Principles and how we can be better leaders in the nonprofit world.  Here\'s link to Larry\'s great book on Amazon. And here\'s the 8 Principles web site. | Keeping the data on our donors, our supporters and the people that we serve secure is absolutely crucial for the success of any organization.\xa0There\'s really nothing that strikes fear in the heart of fundraisers or leaders at nonprofits worse than the idea of a data breach. Paul Ruffalo, who has decades of experience working in this area knows this, and I got on the line to talk with him about what\'s changing in the world of data security, and what he thinks organizations should be doing best to protect their data, which is one of the key pieces of treasure that donors and other supporters leave us. | How do you provide service to your donors or alumni at 3:00 AM in the morning? Or get them answers to their questions about giving, reunions, projects or even planned giving in real time? An AI chatbot may your answer. On this episode, our "designated millennials" Peter Christian and Quinn McGourty-Holland teach Brian Gawor how to make a chatbot work, including followup campaigns through Facebook Messenger integration. If you want a demo of the chatbot, get in touch with us today at ContactUs@RuffaloNL.com | Engaging students in philanthropy is a key part of your fundraising development plan -- learning about the impact of donors, engaging students to give before they graduate, and asking students to help in the stewardship effort all can make a difference. Chris McBride from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Howard Heevner from UC Santa Cruz, faculty members at the CASE 2019 Engaging Students in Philanthropy Symposium talk about the power of student philanthropy programs. Find out more about the Symposium here: https://www.case.org/engaging-students-philanthropy-symposium \xa0 \xa0 | Running your giving program strategically definitely means thinking out to start of the year, how you\'re going to approach donors, ask them for gifts and thank them, but it also means putting in place the infrastructure to deal with the unexpected. Missy Kennedy at UNC Wilmington is an expert at this. She\'s had a lot of success over the past few years engaging the entire campus community and dealing with unexpected needs and challenges that philanthropy could definitely have an impact on. I got Missy on the line to talk about her annual giving program and what she thinks is next for the agile, strategic annual giving program. Check out UNCW at https://giving.uncw.edu/ | Katrina VanHuss at Turnkey is transforming peer to peer philanthropic engagement. In this conversation, we talk about the psychology of peer to peer donors, technology and strategy that can maximize peer engagement, and what we think is next for peer to peer fundraising. Check out TurnKey at: https://www.turnkeyp2p.com/ |  One of the consistent things that I hear from institutions that I work with is that they\'re really interested in doing a better job engaging younger donors. We call them millennials. We\'re lucky enough at RNL to have two millennials of our own. Peter Christian and Quinn McGourty-Holland, who are just rock stars. They spend their days talking with RNL partners about new solutions and how best to surprise and delight what could be the most generous generation in history. We\'re going to watch something fun today, and it\'s the designated millennials podcast, as part of Fundraising Voices, here at RNL. For the first episode, I got on the line with Quinn and Peter to talk a little bit about how they think we could do a good job engaging their own generation, a group of alumni that is often giving at about one half the rate of the overall alumni population. Key insights: - Make giving easy, fun and social - Use engaging technologies like crowdfunding, giving days and social media to change the game with young donors - Authenticity is key, and let the donors become part of the conversation - Millennial donor engagement is probably the best way to engage everyone! | Like many of you I\'m lucky enough to have more than one alma mater. One of those is Illinois State University where I\'m actually still currently a student finishing up my doctoral degree. I came to Illinois State University kind of in the middle of my career and the institution really blew me away. ISU has an incredibly deep commitment to the success of students. When you look at the key statistics on Illinois State University they blow away the competition in terms of retention, student success, student satisfaction. And one of the reasons for that, is that throughout their entire history they\'ve just been totally focused on education. They were a Teachers College until in the 70s they transformed into the modern comprehensive university. Along with that came a shift in fundraising strategy, and the institution started raising more. Now, they\'re in the midst of a transformational campaign and like all campaigns there\'s more than one effort involved. Modern campaigns now also will often include a big push in annual giving. I\'ve had an opportunity to talk with Jillian Nelson at Illinois State University about the efforts of ISU to grow alumni giving, the number of alumni who give in any given year, and by nature of that, of course, alumni participation. I got Jillian on the line to talk a little bit about ISU\'s efforts to transform donor engagement, the new things they\'re trying, what they\'ve had success with, and what they think is next to engage this great group of alumni. | Over 30 years ago, Al Ruffalo wanted to help colleges and universities, and he gave it a try. What came of his efforts, and the efforts of the people who were part of those initial experiments, was the modern college and university phone outreach program, which has raised billions of dollars. It\'s also been a lifeline of real, honest to goodness conversations between students and alumni for the past three decades. This work is obviously changing, and the company that Al and company built has changed, now encompassing a whole suite of tech-enabled data driven programs that serve both fundraising and enrollment goals. But the mission to make a personal connection and to make every college and university part of the family hasn\'t changed as the company transformed into the modern Ruffalo Noel Levitz. I got my friend Al on the line to talk about his journey and what he thinks is next for higher education donor and student engagement.', 'chan_desc': 'This podcast features conversations with fundraisers, researchers and thought leaders to help propel your fundraising results.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts62/v4/9e/14/0e/9e140e5a-fab0-d504-2be9-f5abe23afd7d/mza_8425636918988252422.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-10-01'}}

A preview of the questions: 1. What is a good way to express to your donors and prayer team that you really do care about them, especially when they’re long distance and can’t be visited. Do you try to just keep in contact? Send gifts? 2. Our biggest challenge is finding new churches, families, and individuals to support us. How do we get in front of (at least virtually) new audiences? How can we enlarge our circle of influence without having to go back to the United States? 3. My mailing list is relatively small and dried up (little response). How do I get more new contacts? I need new leads! 4. How do I ask the people that I love and care about? What if they say ‘no’ and it creates an awkwardness in the relationship? 5. I have been leaning on the support of a few friends and family members. I have reached the point where I feel exhausted with asking family and friend to continue supporting my ministry. What do I do? 6. I have been a missionary for a long time now and I’ve run through my list. How do I approach people outside of the ministry for funds? 7. There is a perception that people in the country I serve do not need missionaries because it doesn’t appear to be a poor country. It is one of the most spiritually impoverished nations in the world. How do I share my story so they’ll want to support our mission? 8. Whenever I talk to my current supporters about bringing along others they know who might want to support our cause, they freak out and I never get any names. How do I build a team that wants to refer others to me? 9. Most people assume the work we do comes with a salary and we’ve had little transition in between our roles to have time to fundraise. How do we overcome these challenges? 10. One of my biggest challenges is feeling like you are alone in doing this. But, since I began listening to you guys things have totally changed. I received initial training, but haven’t received more info, wisdom and outside resources.

I\'ve been featured in business publications like Entrepreneur, Inc, and Forbes -- and my days are spent helping organizations clarify their message. More than that, I love missions. Before I launched my consulting practice, I was a youth pastor and worship leader -- and also served on the mission field in countries like Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica, and Spain. I understand the unique challenges of balancing missions, ministry, and money -- and I\'m excited to help you grow your donor base and raise more money." Mary Valloni: "I love helping great causes raise the money they need! I\'m a former development director for the American Cancer Society, the ALS Association, and Special Olympics. My book Fundraising Freedom contains the strategies I\'ve used to help these organizations. I love to fundraise, but more importantly I love people. After raising millions of dollars for such causes, I realized too many missionaries don\'t have access to the training and resources they need to stay and flourish on the field. It wasn\'t until my dad passed away in 2013 that I knew I needed to pursue my dream to start my own consultancy. My mission today is to educate, encourage and empower nonprofit and ministry leaders to raise the funds they need to fulfill their mission."

Observing that some of their friends were radical joyful givers, they set out to spread the message of biblical generosity among those entrusted with much. | Pete and Debbie Ochs may look like the typical American couple, but their lives are anything but common. Having seen generosity modeled growing up, they purposed to be as successful as possible so their 10% for God could be a big number. They also had big plans for the other 90% until God got a hold of their hearts. After 15 years on this generosity journey they are challenging their faith by sharing more than money with local inmates who are proving that the power of generosity can change lives and our world. | Katherine and Alan Barnhart added an interesting twist to the American dream and made it their business not to get rich. As newlyweds, they set up safe guards to protect them from the pitfalls of money as they took over a family business. From the beginning, they set a financial finish line and told God if He prospered the company they would use it to advance the Kingdom instead of advancing their lifestyle. With a winsomeness that is contagious, Alan tells the story of God’s richness toward them and their journey to live the life that is truly life promised in scripture. | Tom and Bree Hsieh may seem like the average American couple, but their lives are anything but typical. Having accumulated significant wealth in the technology era, they chose a different path that has led to more joy and freedom for their family. | Growing up as an orphan, Janice Worth believed that money equaled security. As a successful entrepreneur, Janice admits she has always loved money—making it, spending it, and giving it away. After meeting Jesus as an adult though, her motivation for giving has moved from a place of fear to a place of freedom. Janice’s journey opens her heart to see that true security isn’t found in our zeros, but in the loving arms of Jesus who richly provides for all our needs.', 'chan_desc': 'The story of Generous Giving began in the 1990s when five friends came together, challenged by the question of what could happen if Christians were truly generous with their resources, living out the joy of giving instead of the duty of tithing.

But what does innovation really mean in an industry that is heavily regulated and often struggling to keep up with the latest digital trends? Ryan Foss,\xa0Senior Director of Incubation at Filene, joins us to discuss. | While credit unions have undoubtedly been affected by the rise of fintech startups, the concept of a "credit union startup" in this day and age is almost unheard of. If anything, the industry is trending in the opposite direction -- toward the consolidation of existing credit unions rather than the creation of new ones. But Civic FCU, a startup credit union that launched in 2019, is bucking the trend. Bijal Gami, VP of Operations; Lamar Heyward - SVP of Marketing at Civic FCU; and Michael Spink, SVP of R&D join us for an animated discussion of how they are executing on Civic FCU\'s core strategy, why they started a credit union instead of a fintech company, and what we can learn by marrying a startup culture with the cooperative principles. | For many Americans, a few hundred dollars can mean the difference between financial stability and distress. Financial distress is not an isolated problem; rather, it has ripple effects that extend not just to a person\'s family, but also his or her employer.

It can be refined into renewable natural gas, and used to power vehicles, heat homes, cook, or generate electricity—just like natural gas. Biogas is a powerful driver for economic growth, particularly in rural areas in need of economic opportunities. Biogas also lowers our greenhouse gas emissions, contributes to clean air and water, and improves soil health.

Decommissioning is the process of dismantling a closed plant, securing or removing its radioactive waste, and lowering a site’s residual radioactivity. Getting it right is critical to communities’ health and safety. Getting it wrong could pose existential threats.The U.S. civilian nuclear fleet is aging out. As civilian reactors approach the end of their operating lives, their economics have been undercut by less expensive natural gas-fired generation. Even though nuclear owners are demanding state subsidies to keep some aging plants open a while longer, it will not stop the coming wave of closures. Six reactors have shut down since 2013. Another 15 are slated to close by 2025. Most of the civilian reactor fleet will inevitably close over the next 20 years.As plants close, previously profitable assets become liabilities owners are eager to offload. Enabled by recent legislative and regulatory changes, private companies (chiefly Holtec International’s joint venture with the Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin and NorthStar’s joint venture with French subsidiary Orano, formerly Areva) are stepping in to acquire the plants, taking over their licenses, liability, decommissioning funds and waste contracts. Their business model is to decommission as quickly and inexpensively as possible, claiming any remaining decommissioning funds as profit. Economic incentives encourage them to pack highly radioactive spent fuel into thin-walled dry storage canisters not designed for the decades or centuries of storage that may be needed. Absent a geologic repository, the companies plan to ship high-level nuclear waste to Consolidated Interim Storage (CIS) sites – one owned by Orano in Texas and another by Holtec in New Mexico.There is currently little opportunity for meaningful input from citizens, municipalities or states into the companies’ decisions on decommissioning, nuclear waste, or use of ratepayer-financed decommissioning funds. Yet more than 80 reactor communities and communities near waste storage sites, plus countless communities along proposed radioactive waste transport routes (which traverse 75 percent of Congressional districts), will be profoundly affected by those decisions.Waste transport, CIS and the emerging privatized model of decommissioning and waste stewardship raise dilemmas and potential safety threats that have yet to be solved, or in some cases adequately studied. Even so, Congress will be called upon this year to decide on legislation and appropriations regarding CIS, Yucca Mountain and other key issues related to decommissioning. Congress has the power to require studies and stronger oversight of decommissioning.To explore these issues, distinguished experts including regulators, independent scientists, NGO advocates, and representatives of affected communities, will speak and answer questions at the briefing. | Please RSVP to expedite check-inA live webcast will be streamed at 2:00 PM EDT at www.eesi.org/livecast (wireless connection permitting)\xa0The Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) invites you to a briefing on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Established by Congress in 1968, NFIP provides affordable, government-administered flood insurance to property owners, renters, and businesses. However, the NFIP is more than just an insurance program, it is also intended to be a floodplain management and flood risk mitigation program. NFIP requires participating communities to adopt and enforce minimum construction and land use regulations that make them less vulnerable to flooding. With over 5 million flood insurance policies in force, the NFIP is the single largest source of flood insurance for homeowners and small businesses.As flood risks grow around the nation, this is an important time for Congress to reform and update this vital 50-year old program to better protect people and property. Without appropriate action, a warming climate coupled with continued development in flood-prone areas will raise the human and economic toll of flood disasters while taxpayer dollars are squandered on risky, business-as-usual practices. The NFIP has reached an important crossroads. After ten temporary extensions since 2017, the NFIP is set to expire on May 31. The program is popular, but it is more than $20 billion in debt, despite the cancellation of $16 billion in debt by Congress in October 2017. Flooding is the most pervasive and costly natural disaster in the United States, and climate change is exacerbating extreme weather events. Warmer temperatures lead to more water evaporation, which makes downpours more frequent and intense, leading to more flooding. Since the 1980s, the U.S. has experienced a $100 billion increase in total flood losses each decade; however, NFIP losses did not show a significant increase until the 2005 hurricane season. Fast-paced, inadequately regulated development in areas prone to flooding is also a major cause of such rising expenses.This briefing will provide a basic understanding of the National Flood Insurance Program, its history, its challenges, and reforms needed. The panel will provide important background and highlight new strategies for improving NFIP’s financial stability and for reducing the impacts of future floods on vulnerable populations and communities. | Please RSVP to expedite check-inA live webcast will be streamed at 2:00 PM EDT at www.eesi.org/livecast (wireless connection permitting)\xa0The Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) invites you to a briefing to explore how the quality of buildings contributes to the national economy and promotes healthier environments, and to learn how Congress can support such benefits. Because Americans spend over 90 percent of their time indoors, the design, construction, and operation of buildings greatly influence the health, productivity, and safety of their occupants.As Congress develops legislation and conducts oversight around infrastructure investment, it must also consider opportunities to promote overall sustainability, resilience, and well-being. Just as Congress has incorporated “Buy America” provisions so that dollars spent in America benefit Americans, Congress should also incorporate standards and provisions into infrastructure investment to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used to promote healthy, safe, and productive environments and buildings that will benefit the occupants and, furthermore, the economy. Congress should also continue to support research and technical assistance, as well as the development of codes and standards to improve current building practices.At this briefing, hear directly from the experts:Understand how modern building codes provide $11 in flood, earthquake and hurricane mitigation benefits for every dollar invested; however, less than a third of communities at risk of natural hazards have adopted contemporary building codes.Discover how light and lighting design play a role in your daily activities. Proper lighting design can help prevent depression, distraction, and a variety of other health risks.Realize that, in the absence of a holistic focus on how buildings are designed, constructed and operated, federal investments made in buildings can fail to achieve their potential. There have been multiple deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning in HUD-funded housing, and the federal government continues to fund the construction of buildings to standards that do not meet FEMA’s minimum requirements for post-disaster reconstruction. | Please RSVP to expedite check-inA live webcast will be streamed at 2:00 PM EDT at www.eesi.org/livecast (wireless connection permitting)The Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) and National Hydropower Association (NHA) invite you to a briefing on the role of hydropower in meeting U.S. climate and electric grid reliability and resiliency goals. In 2018, hydropower was the largest generator of renewable electricity in the United States. Beyond the benefit of providing clean, renewable energy generation, hydropower and pumped storage can also be a strategic partner for other, variable renewable energy resources. Pairing hydropower with wind and solar can help them achieve greater penetration and integration while optimizing grid performance.Opportunities to upgrade and expand the existing hydro fleet, and for new project development, are available across the country. However, challenges holding the industry back from fully realizing this growth, including lack of valuation of hydropower’s benefits in energy and environmental markets and policy; regulatory uncertainty; and disparities in tax policy support.This briefing will examine the energy, environmental and grid benefits hydropower (and other waterpower technologies, such as pumped storage, conduit power and marine energy) provides, as well as the policy changes needed to sustain hydropower projects and promote continued deployment.

After the keynote sessions, Josh and David did a panel discussion and Q&A, joined by Michele Hendrickson, Capital Area Regional Director for Students for Life of America and Heather Sells, CEO of the Catherine Foundation, a local Pregnancy Resource Center. The panel discussion was hosted by Ali Rak from the Southern Maryland Pro-Life Symposium. Apologies for occasional audio issues in the panel discussion.

We\'ve made some edits where possible, and you can always get the gist of what she\'s saying. Questions:  0:01:29 - From your standpoint, what does the pro-life movement need to do to become more effective? 0:16:00 - What should pro-life advocates avoid and what hurts our cause the most? 0:31:00 - What is access to abortion like in Southern Maryland? Where does a woman who is abortion-minded go to terminate a pregnancy? How many of them tend to go to the local Pregnancy Resource Centers? Paint a picture of what it\'s like to be in crisis in Southern Maryland. 0:35:49 - What does counseling an abortion-minded woman look like in your Pregnancy Resource Center as opposed to sidewalk counseling where you often only have a moment to start that conversation? 0:43:39 - How are college and high school students shaping the pro-life movement? How do we get more youth involved, and why should there be a Students for Life club at every school in the country? 0:51:26 - Josh, as a "connoisseur\xa0of good arguments and gracious conversation," how can pro-lifers use Facebook and social media as a force for good? 0:56:06 - How do we build the pro-life community locally, one that is engaged and motivated toward action, rather than just being pro-life? 1:04:53 - Can we learn anything from the effectiveness of the gay marriage movement that we can apply to our movement? 1:09:55 - It seems like there is so much emphasis these days on individual rights, where for some people, even if they personally feel like abortion is wrong, they don\'t feel like it\'s their place to speak out against abortion because they don\'t want to offend someone. How do you get beyond that? 1:13:10 - You said that you don\'t approach this issue from a religious\xa0standpoint, and I\'m struggling\xa0with the idea of stopping at the concept of equal rights because I think equal rights come from a religious standpoint. I\'m assuming you talk to lots of college students who don\'t believe in equal rights. How do you deal with that without getting into the religious aspect that we\'re created in God\'s image and not a product of evolution? 1:19:32 - Josh, you mentioned utilitarianism. Can you explain what that is and how it might come up in abortion conversations? 1:21:33 - I was really struck by a statistic that was shared about one in four women in church having had an abortion. How can we effectively express that graphic imagery and very strongly worded signs almost create a PTSD kind of moment for a lot of women who have made a very difficult decision in their lives, and would like to be involved in the pro-life movement, but can\'t abide by being in that presence? How do we overcome that obstacle?

Tahverlee and Thomas talk about the factors that stop women from being promoted, to inherent assumptions that women of a certain age will leave to have kids, correcting gender bias issues and SO much more!Balancing the role of breadwinner and primary caregiver is usually a female role, how do we get people to recognize the impact of emotional labor? We grapple with these questions in this episode and try to tease out possible solutions.

In this new environment, financial services customers and providers need to grapple with the issues of data security and privacy, says Christina Tetreault, senior policy counsel for Consumer Reports Advocacy. These two are related in that they are both about controlling access to data. Where they differ is that security is about controlling outside attacks, while privacy is about giving customers control over how their data is used. Consumer Reports has teamed up with other organizations to form an open-source called effort “the Digital Standard” that seeks to create privacy and security standard for future product design. You can learn more about it at www.thedigitalstandard.org. This year’s Power of Prepaid will feature several discussions on the future of payments, privacy, and security and will be held April 8-10, in Washington DC.

As entrepreneurs have moved to seize the opportunities in this new industry, federal laws make payments difficult. In this episode, we talk with Annie Nagle, the Chief Operating Officer of Verdant Medical, a cannabis start-up in Massachusetts. We discuss the challenges of both accepting and making payments. In addition, we discuss the challenges of paying employees and how the cannabis industry may provide opportunities to people who have been shut out of employment.

Maryanne shares her views on the different players in entrepreneurial ecosystems, roles they play and services they offer to help social entrepreneurs succeed. On this podcast, you will learn:  Why entrepreneurial ecosystems are important - just like Silicon Valley for technology startups or Hollywood for films, these ecosystems increase the productivity of enterprises associated with the ecosystem, drive the pace of innovation and help stimulate the formation of new enterprises. Learn about ANDE, its focus on Small and Growing Businesses (SGBs), and its work in building strong local entrepreneurial ecosystems - with 8 offices in emerging economies, having 280+ members as service providers providing financial and non-financial assistance to social entrepreneurs and operating in 150 countries. About ANDE\'s 6x6 framework or key activity domains that underpin its entrepreneurial ecosystem services, such as: (i) finding entrepreneurs, (ii) training entrepreneurs, (iii) cultivating physical and virtual support spaces for entrepreneurs, (iv) funding support for all types of financing, (v) enabling entrepreneurs with legal, regulatory support, and finally (v) celebrating entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs. How entrepreneurs can find and make use of the different services provided by the ANDE ecosystem and its member organizations - such as networking events, acceleration programs, pitch competitions, funding support, legal services, etc. And finally, how it is also extremely important for investors and entrepreneurial support service providers to be embedded in the local ecosystem and possess an understanding of the local context, challenges, and opportunities in order to deliver maximum value to entrepreneurs.  \xa0 Links to Resources:  Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE) Global ANDE East Africa Chapter Website  \xa0 Connect with Maryanne:   LinkedIn Twitter  | Sagun Saxena, co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer of KOKO Networks, is a company operating in Kenya and India that builds and deploys a dense network of kiosks inside local corner stores that distribute bio-ethanol for the modern cookers they sell. This is the third episode in our second 3-part series on invention-based entrepreneurs, supported by The Lemelson Foundation. The series aims to provide unique insights into some of the challenges and workarounds faced by entrepreneurs creating hardware products in emerging markets. On this episode you will learn:  A description of the physical product, and how KOKO customers use this on a day-to-day basis. 0:58.  KOKO deploys dense networks of KOKOpoints inside neighborhood stores across the city, which communicate real-time with the KOKO Cloud. Customers can buy KOKO Cookers, refill their KOKO Canisters with KOKO Fuel, and access other useful products and services.   The India team supports the engineering and manufacturing of KOKO Fuel, and the first commercial market they are targeting is East Africa, specifically Nairobi, which already has 700 KOKOpoint dispensers throughout the city. 3:10.  Target is to get around 200-250 households around each dispenser location.   Long term goal is to be in at least 40 to 50 major metropolitan areas across Sub-Saharan Africa. How they move highly flammable liquid around the city and partner with large oil companies which already have the infrastructure in place at scale. 6:45 Why they decided to manufacture in India versus locally in Kenya. 10:45.  Cost considerations, and many other factors including logistics. Pros: engineering skills in product iteration, moving product in and out of India easier for global markets, density of suppliers, stable/cheap energy (electricity), and contract workers. 15:00. Cons: Long logistics chain (India is far away), Kenya import uncertainty especially with import taxes of new products not yet categorized. 18:45.   Top level tips on achieving compliance with regulations. 21:15.  Chose this market because clean cooking is a priority for the government, Kenya has a reputation of innovation, and other countries in the region respect how the Kenyan Bureau of Standards (KEBs) looks at new technology - a regulatory body that has a rigorous process for supporting innovation and making new products available. Partnerships with established players adds to credibility. Organizations like gearbox (tied to universities), plus commercial partners like Vivo Energies (the Shell brand) which has world class facilities 25:17.   How they mobilized capital for hardware with just a prototype. First, articulated a vision, then tried to demonstrate demand (ie. consumer appetite at their price points). 27:20.

We talk about Simon\'s invention that is set to propel manufacturing in Kenya to compete with the likes of China and other industrialised nations. Proteq Automation builds CNC machines, which are computer numerical control machines. CNCs control machining tools (drills, boring tools, lathes) and 3D printers by means of a computer to alter a blank piece of material (metal, plastic, wood, ceramic, or composite) to meet precise specifications by following programmed instructions and without a manual operator. \xa0 On this episode you\'ll learn:  Simon was motivated to solve the problem of not being able to manufacture high--precision products in Kenya. 3.50. He realised he needed to approach bigger contract manufacturers who had existing contracts, and could help them achieve better per unit costs with his machine. 6.04 Helping companies with their problem of long turnaround times of sending parts outside Kenya to be manufactured 8.59 Simon started with an engineering degree, moved into programming, and making his own electrical circuits. \xa011.11 He wanted to make enclosures for his circuit boards, so got into vacuum forming, which needed wooden moulds, and he needed a machine to make the high precision wooden moulds. He built one at home over the course of a year, whilst working a full time job 14.37 His first client was a university who used it for educational purposes. He did a lot of research online to figure out what parts he needed to make his machine, and which suppliers to order from. He chose US suppliers because they contained alot of content and how-to guides on their website 20.48 His first commercial client was a manufacturer with a contract from General Motors who had to improve their turn around time for custom parts \xa029.47 Simon\'s proposal to the manufacturer included a design to improve turnaround time, which the manufacturer won the tender on. He received a 50% down payment to build his CNC machine for that client 33.04 Training staff is key to the business, as it\'s a unique skill set, and he has a bespoke training scheme for new staff that takes a year. 35.12 Simon doesn\'t have competition and he doesn\'t see it coming, because of the processes and training required for a successful service business 38.48  Resources from this episode:  proteqautomation.co.ke buildyourcnc.com  Connect with Simon:  Twitter @ProteqAutomate Facebook @proteqautomationltd  \xa0 | This week on the Finding Impact Podcast, we are continuing our second series on hardware entrepreneurs, this one with Mike Hahn of PayGo Energy about his hardware development journey. This is the first episode in our second 3-part series on invention-based entrepreneurs, supported by The Lemelson Foundation. The series aims to provide unique insights into some of the challenges and workarounds faced by entrepreneurs creating hardware products in emerging markets. As many will know, from episode 44 with Mike\'s Co-Founder Fausto, PayGo Energy has created a smart meter that sits on an LPG gas cylinder, that lets customers pay on a PAYG basis. On this podcast, you will learn:  How the idea of PayGo came about: started in 2015 with an observation that, on a daily basis, lots of people were lining up at petrol stations to buy kerosene or diesel fuel for cooking and they were bringing small vessels to carry this fuel home, despite there being a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) option 10 meters away. This spurred our question about why aren’t people cooking with LPG? It’s clean, fast, and convenient.   This idea came about while all of the co-founders were working for different organizations within the informal settlements of Nairobi, Kenya.\xa0   What their first basic prototype looked like: technical discovery "can we turn gas on and off with a text message?" How their diverse group of co-founders with diverse skill sets helped: technology development, understanding the market/operations, etc. and this blend of personalities and experiences gave them an advantage early on. For their first prototype they used BRCK components (see episode 111 with Erik Hersman, Co-founder of BRCK  https://findingimpact.com/fip-111-hardware-entrepreneurs-3-3-creating-a-modem-cum-router-device-aimed-at-solving-last-mile-connectivity-issues-in-africa-with-erik-hersman/)\xa0 in order to test how to get some level of accuracy of measuring gas vapor (actual flow) to the stove, and then send that data remotely to a server while including the ability to shut that gas flow off.\xa0 Why he uses SolidWorks for designs and recommends GrabCad for downloading files that other people have made based off of the real object. It makes it easy to plug into My Assembly so you can build something around it, and spatially you are in the right ballpark.\xa0 Why he decided to buy a 3D printer instead of using 3D printing services: it’s incredibly fast and convenient to do it by yourself, especially if you aren’t sure how many iterations will be needed, and you’re learning about the design as you’re making it.\xa0 How they raised their seed round: having a physical prototype and a real functioning unit in someone’s home along with comprehensive market research and a business modeling effort prepared them for that seed round. Also having a couple backers from very early before the seed round helped instill confidence.\xa0 When working with manufacturers it’s a good indicator when you get to meet directly with the CEO.\xa0 Advice for those in the hardware development process: get yourself into it, fake it until you make it. (But his design background at Rhode Island School of Design also helped.) Don\'t be afraid to ask for help. Talk to people, work with in the past who are willing to pick up the phone. i.e. how to do contract with a contract manufacturer.\xa0  Links to resources:  PayGo Energy https://www.paygoenergy.co/\xa0 SolidWorks http://www.solidworks.com/\xa0 GrabCAD https://grabcad.com/  Connect with Mike:  LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhahndesign/\xa0 Twitter https://twitter.com/paygo_energy?lang=en\xa0  | This week on the Finding Impact Podcast, we are talking to Solonia Treodos, Co-founder of The Change School, who describes why social entrepreneurs need a clear fundraising strategy and goal before starting their fundraising activities. Solonia shares her journey of fundraising for The Change School, with lessons from her experience of almost closing a fundraising deal, changing course and walking away from the deal and coming back to it later with a clear strategy. On this podcast, you will learn:  How Change School helps transform organizations and individuals by helping them re-connect with their values, re-design their work and re-define success as authentic leaders. Change School thus equips and empowers people to navigate uncertainty and embrace change during the transition or transformation that they are going through. About Change School\'s journey of testing various offline business models such as: creating immersive retreats for people to re-connect with themselves while enabling a peer-to-peer and community learning experience; to creating Change School mind gyms for bite-sized learning to develop mental resilience; and creating bespoke experiential transformation programs for organizations. How the founders encountered the growth and scale challenges of Change School by evolving and developing an online delivery model of working with its vast pool of trainers and experts while drawing from the expertise of its offline immersive retreats and retaining the Change School brand personality. Why social entrepreneurs should have a strategy of pro-actively approaching investors for funding and alignment with business growth plans rather than just nosediving into fundraising re-actively in trying to impress investors, while not losing focus on the business vision and operating matters such as managing cash flows properly. Finally, you will learn about Change School\'s online courses and tutorials for anyone needing resources and additional support to managing change and transitions.

This incredible service at Open Road Alliance provides capital (loans or grants) to social impact organizations (non-profit and for-profit) facing an unexpected roadblock during implementation. On this episode you will learn:  The story behind why it was set up: founded in 2012 by psychologist and philanthropist Dr. Laurie Michaels to address the need for contingency funds and the absence of risk management practices in philanthropy. It originally started as a grantmaking organization and then moved on to recoverable grants, and finally in 2018 launched Loan Fund Open Road Ventures which is a $50 million dollar commitment towards short term loans on solving this unexpected roadblocks and cash crunches. To date they have put out $18 million towards that $50 million target.  Half of their portfolio is in East Africa.   Fast response: from initial request to decision being made, it’s a period of 6 weeks. Examples of:  Some organizations receiving bridge loans for accounts receivable and / or the large purchase order, and\xa0 Open Road Alliance speaking with actual investors to say that they can help and to not back out.   The Roadblock Analysis Report which has around 150 data points which shows (among other things) that about half of these cash crunches are caused by funder created obstacles.  E.g. An agricultural social enterprise in Kenya can look to see what are the top three risks likely to occur so that they can put a contingency plan in place.   Caroline’s advice from the entrepreneur side: when talking to investors, first make sure they have already raised their funding and ask if they have made their first deal out of their new fund. Impact investors, particularly in East Africa, could do a better job about being clear and transparent regarding their application process, their timeline for disbursement, and criteria they use to make decisions. Open Road Alliances criteria for social entrepreneurs:  1) It has to be mid implementation (ie. you had all the money you needed and then something happened). 2) An “unexpected” criteria (ie. something external outside of the management teams control, like a funder pulling out, the government changing a policy, or an office being robbed, etc.). 3) Discreet criteria (ie. need to be able to fully solve the problem at hand, for example, the average loan is $300k and if you have a million dollar gap, Open Road Alliance won’t be able to fund you until you find that first $500k). 4) Catalytic impact criteria (ie. does this model have the potential to be system changing either in design or scale, and what is the probability of achieving that impact?) **Geography is not important.   The process: an entrepreneur-centric approach. It typically takes 4 to 6 weeks, although the fastest they have ever moved is 7 days. You can connect through an existing investor or reach out to the OpenRoadAlliance.org email to start an initial conversation to talk through your model, ask questions about the roadblock(s), and Open Road Alliance can give a diagnosis to how well things are fitting into their criteria. The next stage is the application which is 4 pages and asks about your model, the roadblock, the solution, and the impact. Open Road Alliance can have a 1 hour call to give feedback to make the application as strong as possible before moving to the investment committee. Then a decision is made after that within a week. In between Open Road Alliance will check references, talk through repayment structures, etc. Open Road Alliance has only had 1 loss out of 60 loans.

The series aims to provide unique insights into some of the challenges and workarounds faced by entrepreneurs creating hardware products in emerging markets. This third part episode is with Erik Hersman, co-founder of BRCK, which creates a modem-cum-router device aimed at solving last-mile connectivity issues in Africa. We\'re going to talk about the early prototypes, how they funded manufacturing and validated the market, some of the challenges they had along the way, and how the product evolved into what it is today. On this episode you’ll learn:\xa0  Erik’s mantra about why “Experience is knowing what not to do.” “Managing expectations.” It took 15-16 months to get a prototype working, then another 12-18 months to build it for the market.  It could be done quicker if you: 1) really know what you’re doing (ie. what materials should be used, 2) if you’re well capitalized (have the money), and 3) if you’re not based in Africa (increases costs and time).   How to validate the market to make sure people will buy it? Kickstarter, the crowdfunding platform, is a great way to find out.  Raised $170,000 then created a for-profit company to raise additional capital.   Early stage companies (particularly in hardware) have to find a balance of when to pull the trigger on shipping.  Internal message was that it is not acceptable to miss deadlines. External message to stakeholders that you try to deliver when you say you’re going to.   Some of the initial problems (that went wrong) and why initial timelines were pushed back: “end of life” manufacturer (ie. they don’t make it anymore), testing at scale, user experience, etc. Internal conversation within the company on whether they are solving the real problem of how do you get people online?  Resulted in business model innovation (more so than technology innovation) which led to Moja wifi in Kenya and Rwanda which serves up free internet to half a million people.   Linear versus non-linear growth: when you’re getting venture backed finance or choose to take venture funding, they are looking for non-linear growth. Why they became a vertically integrated company—discovered value in building everything in house—helps with risk mitigation, agility, and the ability to respond to customer needs. How Moja wifi is funded. What Erik knows now that he wished he knew back then:  Realize earlier that they needed to build a platform on top of the hardware since the hardware is just a means to an end. Focus more capital on the super brck earlier (their next generation device) since it was delayed 6 months. Hiring the right people: maybe hired too fast in some positions and didn’t get the right people.    \xa0Links to Resources:  Company website https://www.brck.com/  Connect with Erik:  Email: Info@brck.com Twitter https://twitter.com/brcknet?lang=en  | This is part two of a 3-part series on invention-based entrepreneurs, supported by The Lemelson Foundation. The series aims to provide unique insights into some of the challenges and workarounds faced by entrepreneurs creating hardware products in emerging markets. This part two episode is with Mary Mwangi of Data Integrated Ltd., and we are going to hear about her electronic hardware development journey on manufacturing products to improve security in public transport, and to reduce financial leakage. Data Integrated Ltd. is creating electronic hardware products for businesses in East Africa to help business owners keep track of money, whether that is transport companies keeping track of passengers, or point of sale (PoS) devices for retail businesses taking cash and mobile money payments. On this episode you will learn:  The biggest problem that most small businesses in Africa face is a lack of data. There is not enough information around their payments, about their resources, and services they are being paid for--there is no digitized or automated way of keeping this and it has been very manual and not very productive.  Cash leakage and loss of revenue for owners Insecurity   Her easy and affordable point of sale (PoS) device for retail businesses taking cash and mobile money payments, particularly small restaurant owners, and making sure it would work for the local African market.  Integrates with mobile money providers, card payments from the bank, and cash payments all captured in one place. Keeps track of inventory that has been paid and gives data back to the owners in an easy to read dashboard so they can make better decisions. Raspberry pi - premade hardware kit for simple programming.   One of the biggest challenges she faced was the long development cycle, having to send electronic boards to China, create a prototype, test, iterate, and send back again for testing. Each iteration can take over two months to get the next version back.  No PCB manufacturer exists in East Africa that can create such small PCB units. Mary recently bought a 3D printer to shorten casing time.   Her struggles with sourcing good local talent so people can help create these PCBs. Since there is no industry in East Africa, there is not as much local talent nor expertise, and people are finding the tools online to teach themselves, so there is a lot of trial and error going on. Her advice is:  Get referrals from local universities Recruit young people keen to learn Accessing experts on LinkedIn, YouTube videos   How she is financing her business with this long development cycle. It is really difficult to get funding for hardware development, so they label themselves as a software company, since they create connected devices for software solutions. How she creates partnerships in order to find hardware solutions and to iterate the product with them, then sell it onto other customers. Once you are able to do it with one company, then you find similar ones that also want the same solution. Finally, you will learn about the new actionable playbook for invention-based entrepreneurs based on interviews and discussions with leaders in the field, delving into the challenges of bringing physical products into the market.

This is the first episode in a 3-part series on invention-based entrepreneurs that aims to provide unique insights into some of the challenges and workarounds faced by entrepreneurs creating hardware products in emerging markets. On this podcast, you will learn:  Why and how William invented a marvellous machine called KunjaBot that is an automatic pipe bender specifically designed for people in the Juakali (informal manufacturing) sector in Kenya. The KunjaBot provides the Juakali sector with access to mass manufacturing capabilities at affordable costs while improving quality and profit margins and allowing them to compete against imported products. About the pay-as-you-bend (akin to a pay-as-you-go) business model of the KunjaBot that enables the Juakali to avoid expensive purchasing costs of manufacturing equipment and absolves them of the costs for operating and maintaining the equipment. How William has dealt with barriers while building the KunjaBot such as customer demand, lack of awareness among the Juakali, business model changes, manufacturing challenges, commitment and lead times from suppliers and contractors, as well engineering and accounting skills to get his project off the ground, etc. About the Gearbox initiative in Kenya and how it enables and provides incredible support to hardware entrepreneurs and inventors to design and build their products through capacity building, maker spaces and engineering and technology support. Finally, you will learn about the new the actionable playbook for invention-based entrepreneurs based on interviews and discussions with leaders in the field, delving into the challenges of bringing physical products into the market.

You\'ll learn how Courier font is a practical tool for donor love, why innovation in fundraising so often doesn\'t work, why ugly powers great fundraising, and how fundraisers can take care of themselves in our sometimes emotionally draining work. |  We asked two new fundraising (and very successful) writers who have been doing some very great work what they know about fundraising that\'s making them succeed. Here\'s what they told us:  Write as one person connecting with one person. Avoid the word "we" -- unless it very clearly means you the reader and I the writer. Start your first draft with this phrase: I\'m writing to you today because... Use the word you a lot. Articulate the fundraising offer early and often. Tell a story of need, not success. Ask clearly for money. (Don\'t hint around!) Write at a 6th grade reading level. Include a P.S. and restate whatever is the most important thing in your message. Have a deadline, and mention it often. Keep the organization out of the way -- make it about what the donor can do.

California Health & Welfare Agency (Nos. 81-4565, 82-4174 (9th Cir. June 22, 1983)); "[a] plurality of circuit courts use or incorporate Bonnette\'s factors in their joint-employer test," DOL said. The four factors assess whether an alleged joint employer: 1) hires or fires the employee in question; 2) supervises and controls the employee\'s work schedule or conditions of employment; 3) determines the employee\'s rate and method of payment, and 4) maintains the employee\'s employment records.The agency also said its proposal will explain that other factors may be relevant if the initial factors show the alleged joint employer: a) exercises significant control over the terms and conditions of the employee\'s work; or b) otherwise acts directly or indirectly in the interest of the employer in relation to the employee. Whether an employee is economically dependent on the potential joint employer is "not relevant" in determining that employer\'s economic reality under FLSA, DOL said: "Accordingly, to determine joint employer status, no factors should be used to assess economic dependence." | Survey reveals employees’ major financial stressors, millennials’ interest in gig workMetLife\'s 17th Annual US Employee Benefit Trends Study 2019 reveals that we are now seeing additional trends redefining why we work and what work means to people. According to the study, “[a]s employees leverage work to gain more fulfillment, pursue their goals, and align their values and experiences more authentically, they’re looking to employers to help them manage this new work-life world.”The study revealed that employees’ number one source of stress is personal finances. “Regardless of age or life-stage, a focus on finances tops the list as the biggest concern employees have day to day.”Some of employees’ stress about finances stems from short-term concerns, like staying on top of bills or paying for urgent health needs. Others stem from long-term goals — in fact, 3 of employees’ top 5 financial concerns directly relate to retirement, even among those who are relatively confident in their finances.What are employees’ top 5 sources of financial stress? Being able to afford the cost of healthcare in retirement - 72% Outliving my retirement savings - 68% Having money to pay bills if someone loses their job - 67% Having money to cover out-of-pocket medical costs - 67% Ability to rely on Social Security/Medicare in retirement - 66%Employees say that solutions that help address financial stress are what they need most to thrive in the workplace and at home. Nearly 6 in 10 employees say an appropriate salary is one of the most important elements to successfully navigating and thriving in the workplace, the study states.“Yet, a moderate salary increase can only help so much when dealing with an unexpected expense, whether it’s a broken bone or a flooded basement. That’s why financial support in the form of financial wellness programs, retirement plans, and a broad set of benefits can play such a crucial role in helping employees manage the unexpected and plan for the future. And employees realize this too — roughly 5 in 10 employees say better benefits are key to thriving.”The gig economy can be a challenge and an opportunity for employersThe same technologies and evolving expectations that have driven flexibility and the need for new skills have also driven the ability to blend work and life. For instance, the evolution of mobile infrastructure has made part-time work accessible at the tap of a finger. These technologies are introducing an entirely new way of working: the gig economy, characterized by work that is often based on a fixed-term contract or paid per project via a third party or online marketplace.As employees shift their expectations and needs for fulfillment inside and outside of work, the gig economy offers a unique solution, as it provides employees a useful outlet to gain more short- and long-term flexibility, control their schedules and projects, and earn extra cash.While interest in the gig economy tends to skew towards younger generations, it’s appealing to older workers, as well. 1 in 2 Gen Z or Millennials, 3 in 10 Gen X, and almost 1 in 4 Boomers are interested in gig work. And gig work is appealing to workers for a variety of reasons.What are the top 3 reasons full-time workers are interested in gig work?\xa01) flexible schedule - 31%; 2) ability to work where they want - 29%; and 3) ability to take on multiple different projects - 22%But ultimately, employees want to ensure that joining the gig workforce doesn\'t come at a loss of financial stability — their primary source of stress.The Study states that employers can use unique levers to cater to employees’ desires for financial security and stability. “Certainly, this means considering salary increases, but also creating benefits packages that most gig opportunities simply can’t compete with. Additionally, creating policies and experiences within the workplace that offer the same gig-like diversity of ... | CMS Extends Small Group Transitional Relief Policies through 2020On Mar 25, 2019, CMS issued a\xa0new one year extension\xa0of its transitional policy for non-grandfathered small group plans that are not compliant with the ACA.Policyholders will be allowed to renew their transitional plan coverage (commonly referred to as ‘grandmothered plans’) through Oct 1, 2020 as long as the coverage does not extend beyond Dec 31, 2020. If CMS does not issue another extension next year, all non-compliant policies must become compliant by Jan 1, 2021. Any policy renewed during the 2020 calendar year after Jan 1 must have a short plan year in order to terminate by Dec 31. CMS believes that requiring transitional policies terminate immediately before Jan 1, 2021 will “facilitate changing from non-compliant coverage to Affordable Care Act-compliant coverage, which requires a calendar year policy year in the individual market.”As specified in prior extensions, carriers that renew coverage under the extended transitional relief policy must provide a notice to affected individuals and small businesses about the limitations of non-compliant coverage for each policy year.We have confirmed with most of the state DOL\'s and Departments of Insurance that they will allow grand"mothered" plans to continue, provide policyholders the freedom to change their anniversary dates, and allow carriers to offer short plan renewal options within CMS guidelines.This is the fifth extension of the transitional relief policy and third under the Trump Administration. While the scope of this extension is again limited to one year, the context of the announcement indicates a longer term commitment to relief continuation. CMS Administrator Seema Verma explains: “Not extending the grandmothered plan policy would cancel plans that are meeting people’s needs today and, as a result, force people to decide between buying coverage they cannot afford on the individual market or going uninsured. By extending the grandmothered plan policy, we are following through on our commitment to protect those left behind by Obamacare.” The\xa0CMS press release\xa0cites this transitional relief extension and recent actions to expand access to association health plans and short-term health plans as examples of the Trump Administration’s commitment to providing more affordable coverage options to Americans “left behind by the PPACA.”BackgroundIn response to public pressure, CMS first announced transitional relief for small groups and individuals allowing them renew the coverage they had in place on Oct 1, 2013 even though that coverage did not comply with various ACA market reforms including community rating, essential health benefits, and metallic benefit levels. Timeline of related guidance: Nov 14, 2013\xa0– The original transitional policy. Available to policy years beginning Jan 1 – Oct 1, 2014. All non-compliant policies would terminate by Sep 30, 2015.

In order for the financial assistance to be nontaxable, does the program need to be in writing?Answer:\xa0Yes. Adoption assistance programs are governed under Internal Revenue Code Sec. 137, which specifies that an adoption assistance program must be a separate written plan of the employer that meets certain requirements.Under an employer-provided program, Sec. 137 excludes from an employee’s gross income amounts furnished by the employer for adoption assistance purposes. Sec. 137 allows an employer to provide up to $14,080 in 2019 per child on an aggregate, not annual, basis for\xa0"qualified adoption expenses."\xa0Adoptive parents’ adjusted gross income (AGI) determines the amount of the adoption expense limit that applies to them. In 2019, the credit begins to phase out at an AGI of $211,160 and is completely phased out at $251,160.While Sec. 137 requires a written plan, it does not specify that the plan follows a particular format. At a minimum, the written plan should define the group of employees eligible to receive benefits, and describe the specific benefits offered under the program and any applicable limitations. Participation in the plan may be limited to a classification of employees determined by the employer, but the plan may not discriminate in favor of officers, shareholders, or the highly compensated or their dependents. Finally, reasonable notification of the terms and conditions of the plan must be provided to eligible employees.Source:\xa0Internal Revenue Code Sec. 137.', 'chan_desc': "This podcast is for HR Professionals, Business Owners, and CEO's who want to learn and discuss the tools, tactics, and strategies that help us create a happier, more productive, employee workforce.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/67/8f/17/678f17d6-abf8-49bb-e1a1-f8d656eab565/mza_2069892375851236081.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2018-03-12'}}

Yet, we fail to ask these important questions: What happens after the product is in our customers hands?  What happens after the contract has been implemented/converted and/or value analysis has chosen the best valued product?  We know that the right price is in our ERP/Purchasing Systems, but do we know if the projected savings hit our bottom line?  In order to get a better grasp on this vital concept, savings validation needs to occur because the costs ramifications of losing savings cannot be left flapping out in the wind any longer.  Here is additional rational for doing so: | My son, Robert W. Yokl, VP of SVAH Solutions,  sent me an article the other day from BBC Sports about the Mercedes Formula 1 racing team, who won six  consecutive championships, on their “relentless pursuit of excellence”.   More specifically, how Toto Wolff, head of Mercedes’s motorsport program, never stops pushing for even higher performance from his award-winning team.  Here’s four tips from Wolff that you too can use in your own pursuit of supply chain excellence | The old supply chain adage of getting the right product at the right price to the right customer at the right time has always been a our goal.  But what happens after the product is in the hands of the customer, the vendor contract is converted and/or the value analysis study is implemented?  We know the pricing is right in our ERP/Purchasing Systems but does the dollars hit our bottom lines as we indend them to?  Savings validation is a system to take away the “we believe we are going to saving based on our estimates from the previous year” and replacing it with, here is exactly how much we saved (or not saved) on all of our initiatives. | Value analysis is a systematic process that does not have any software tied to it in any way.  You may hear companies call their software Value Analysis Software but it is only software for tracking the project workflow of your various value analysis studies.  As one client said to me who had a software in place, “It doesn’t do any value analysis at all.”  What we are talking about is the next generation of reporting that is geared towards giving you the tools to make your value analysis job easier, better and quicker while giving you better for decision making – before, during and after the studies have been completed. | After reading an article by David Shannon and Chuck Miller of Bain & Company about “Closed-Loop Savings Verification” processes (CLSV) in other industries, I discovered that this industry best practice also mirrored what is happening in healthcare. More and more, hospitals, systems and IDN’s CFOs are requiring their supply chain professionals to verify their projected savings on every savings initiative. In my opinion, this is because too often savings are reported by supply chain management to CFOs that never hits their healthcare organization’s bottom line.  To avoid this from happening at your healthcare organization, here are three powerful tactics to ensure your healthcare organization has a foolproof “Closed-Loop Savings Verification” process that works | Benchmarking is nothing new to the healthcare supply chain and clearly you are thinking right now that, “We Benchmark at Our Hospital/System!”   So, you know the value of benchmarking from one level or another, but do we apply this to our supply chain and value analysis initiatives as much as we could?  The answer to that question is a big no!   Why is this?  First and foremost, nobody wants to be compared to another organization and even worse, be told that you are weak or not up to snuff in an area that you should be or perhaps you feel you are.  Yes, you have a choice, choose to ignore the benchmark or try to ask, why is this, why are we running high and what can we do to be the “Best Benchmark” instead of the lower comparative? | Healthcare Value analysis training appears to be at the bottom of most VA practitioners to do list, yet it is an imperative that you and your VA teams have basic, advanced and then masterclass value analysis training. Not one-time training, but training on an on-going basis.\xa0 One hospital we worked with that has annual VA training for their VA team leaders and VA team members. This is the only way to ensure that your VA training sticks.\xa0 If this isn’t your practice too, here are 4 reasons why you must do so before your Hospital VA teams lose their edge | Just like the value analysis revolution that we experienced in the early 2000’s to the present we are now seeing that supply utilization management (SUM) is becoming a major buzzword in the healthcare supply chain. | If you are a frequent reader of our blog, you would know that we are very high on hospital supply chain benchmarking because it will make your supply chain operation better than just good.  Yet, for those who still doubt the benefits of healthcare supply benchmarking here are four things you need to know to change this mindset | Every healthcare supply chain organization we know of has either a monthly, quarterly and annual savings reports that they prepare for their senior healthcare management.\xa0 Most are prepared on spreadsheets that limit the accuracy, comprehension and integrity of these reports.\xa0 Consequently, here are three big pitfalls we see that you need to avoid if you want your savings reports to reflect your real short and long-term savings accurately.Plus we highlight two of the biggest savings areas in the healthcare supply chain that you should be aware of in our Q & A Section', 'chan_desc': "Join Robert T.

Many things have changed in Washington with regard to science policy and the new administration’s orientation to science.

This interview was recorded on July 6, 2017. | TSK Chef Michael Clarke talks with Ivan Oransky, the co-founder and editor of Retraction Watch, about the blog and its influence, how retractions come to light, how the community responds to retractions for misconduct versus retractions for honest errors, and more. | Jeroen Bosman and Bianca Kramer, librarians at Utrecht University, talk with podcast host Stewart Wills about their 101 Innovations project--an undertaking designed to collect and analyze information on the sometimes bewildering array of new tools that scientists are using to get the job done, and that are reshaping scholarly workflows in a digital age. | Host Stewart Wills talks with Charlotte Haug, the vice-chair of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), about the recent World Conference on Research Integrity, new community guidelines on research transparency and reproducibility, the international dimension of research ethics, and the dangers of sensationalizing retractions. | After a long hiatus, the podcast returns, as Scholarly Kitchen chef Michael Clarke chats with host Stewart Wills about some of the growth engines--from new end-user products and services to new business models to mergers and acquisitions--that companies in scholarly communications are tapping as their traditional individual and institutional subscription businesses cope with flattening prospects. | In this episode, Scholarly Kitchen chef and NISO executive director Todd Carpenter talks with host Stewart Wills about the importance of technical standards in scholarly publishing today, some upcoming things to watch for on the standards horizon, and how publishers need to infuse standards awareness deeper in their organizations. | In this episode, Howard Ratner, Director of Development at CHORUS, provides a status report on the project, a partnership between publishers and federal agencies to facilitate public access to federally funded research; talks about opportunities for synergies between CHORUS and other public-access vehicles; discusses next steps on the project; and also brings us up to date on another community-driven standards project, the contributor-id registry ORCID, which turns one year old today. | In this episode, Peter Brantley, the director of scholarly communication at the start-up Hypothes.is, talks with host Stewart Wills about the firm\'s efforts to build an open annotation layer on the Web, his thoughts on how in-line annotation differs, in both spirit and potential, from the more common practice of online comment streams, and some possible applications in scholarly communication, publishing, and peer review. | In this episode, Scholarly Kitchen chefs Joe Esposito, Michael Clarke, and Kent Anderson talk about the uses and misuses of the term "disruption" in describing the current technological ferment in scholarly publishing, the differences between disruptive and sustaining technologies, and where real industry disruption might come from. | In this episode, Peter Binfield, the publisher of the innovative open-access journal PeerJ, talks with host Stewart Wills about progress at PeerJ in the seven months since the journal\'s launch, its unique business model, the key role of cost control at making PeerJ sustainable, and his perspective on this latest venture in the context of his 20-year career in scholarly publishing.', 'chan_desc': "Periodic audiocasts about trends and events in the world of scholarly publishing, from the authors of the Society for Scholarly Publishing's Scholarly Kitchen blog (http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/ ).", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/8d/84/d6/8d84d65f-137a-9651-a40e-5f84196aa86a/mza_169266341107810365.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2013-05-14'}}

Plenty, according to Robbie Kellman Baxter, author of The Membership Economy. Corporate America has realized the value of selling “membership” and in many cases, is doing it better than associations. I talked to Robbie about what associations can learn from online membership sites. It starts with leading from your mission (easy, right?) and requires understanding how disruptive technology is changing the game (not so easy). © 2019 Mary Byers Find out more at MaryByers.com  Join the conversation on our social sites: @MaryByers on Twitter Mary on Facebook Mary on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | It’s happening: thousands of Baby Boomers are retiring each day, creating a multitude of opportunities in senior leadership in associations all over the country. Do you have a succession plan in place? Operating without one is irresponsible. If you’re a senior leader and there’s no plan, put it at the top of your “To Do” list today. It’s more comfortable for staff and volunteers if you’re the one to bring up the topic. I interviewed Bill Zepp, CAE, retired association executive, regarding his advice on succession. Bill headed three different organizations and has been on both sides: the executive leaving and the one coming in. He’s got great advice for all association professionals, whether you plan to retire in the next five years or not (or hope to step into senior leadership). © 2019 Mary Byers Find out more at MaryByers.com  Join the conversation on our social sites: @MaryByers on Twitter Mary on Facebook Mary on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | Have you ever wondered why members join … and stay … in your association? Been curious about value drivers? Wanted to better understand various membership segments? Hoped to understand why members leave? If so, it may be time to invest in research. Over the years, I’ve seen some impressive work from market research firms partnering with associations. I’m not talking about boiler-plate, off-the-shelf surveys. I’m talking about customized, in-depth inquiries that provide data designed to help drive strategy. In this episode I interview Matt Braun, Vice President of Client Services at Loyalty Research Center. Matt shares some real-life examples of associations that have used survey results to direct strategy as well as discussing the issue of “survey fatigue.” I often hear associations say they “can’t afford” to conduct professional research. My perspective is that most can’t afford not to — especially when it comes to making critical decisions about future activities. The best decisions are data-driven. And collecting data is what research is all about.  © 2019 Mary Byers Find out more at MaryByers.com  Join the conversation on our social sites: @MaryByers on Twitter Mary on Facebook Mary on LinkedIn Produced by Podcast Prowess | As an association leader, what does Visionary Leadership mean and what are the 3 major competencies of visionary leaders?

Operating as you've traditionally done for the last 10, 20, or more years is not a viable option. Gone are the days when members would automatically renew. Today individuals expect value in return for membership. Why shouldn't they? They have a higher demand on their time and more choices on how and from whom they can obtain information due to rapid advances in technology, competition, and social networking.  Mary Byers takes a bold, no-nonsense look at the realities of today's marketplace and what it will take for associations to prosper moving forward. She addresses not only the challenges associations face but the actions essential to a thriving future. Successful Associations Today is an interview series with host Mary Byers, CAE.

But despite best efforts, some participants still don’t succeed. What are some ways government agencies can improve services and ensure participants remain on the right track? In this episode, Kate Gualtieri, MDRC’s Director of Strategy, talks with MDRC Senior Fellow Melissa Wavelet, the former director of the Office of Performance and Strategic Outcomes in the Colorado Department of Human Services, about her experience implementing a variety of data-driven strategies that help city and state government agencies meet their goals and improve the lives of the people they serve. They also discuss Melissa’s work at MDRC on the TANF Data Collaborative, a new initiative sponsored by the Office of Family Assistance and the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation in the federal Administration for Children and Families, created in an effort to accelerate the use of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) data for program improvement and evidence-building at the federal, state, and local levels. | Nationwide, only 25 percent of full-time, first-time students at community colleges earn a degree within three years. To increase graduation rates for low-income community college students, the City University of New York (CUNY) launched Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) — a comprehensive program that provides wrap-around support services to students, including one-on-one advising, help covering transportation and book expenses, and tutoring. MDRC’s evaluation of the CUNY ASAP model found that the program doubled graduation rates in New York City. Three community colleges in Ohio successfully replicated the ASAP model as part of the ASAP Ohio Demonstration, and MDRC’s evaluation found positive results in line with those at CUNY. Join Katie Beal as she talks with Dr. Marcia Ballinger, President of Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio, about the demonstration and what it takes to scale a comprehensive program like ASAP. | High-quality preschool education can have substantial positive impacts on children’s early learning and development, as well as longer-term outcomes like graduating from high school and attending college. But the boost in skills young children experience can fade out as they move on to kindergarten and elementary school, exacerbating the achievement gap between children from more- versus less-advantaged backgrounds. This fadeout pattern has drawn greater attention to students’ experiences after preschool, in early elementary school, and helped increase support for improving curricular alignment from preschool to third grade. Alignment refers to the range of policies and practices designed to launch young children on a positive developmental pathway, with the early elementary grades continuing to build on what children learn in preschool. Join Leigh Parise as she talks with MDRC’s Meghan McCormick about measuring quality in preschool programs and the challenges of implementing aligned curricula. | Can giving small loans to low-income people to start or grow their businesses help lift them out of poverty and improve overall well-being? That’s the idea behind microlending – a promising approach implemented by institutions worldwide. But only limited rigorous evidence is available on the model’s effectiveness, especially in advanced economies. MDRC is evaluating Grameen America, a program that provides small loans to groups of low-income women in the U.S. using a model designed by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Muhammad Yunus for the original Grameen Bank program in Bangladesh in the 1970s. But carrying out the first random assignment evaluation of Grameen America and its complex model presented unique challenges. In this episode, Katie Beal talks with Marcus Berkowitz, Vice President of Technology and Innovation at Grameen America, and Richard Hendra, MDRC’s Senior Fellow who leads the evaluation, about the partnership between the organizations and how they worked together to overcome those challenges. | One out of every 10 young people between the ages of 16 and 24 is neither working nor in school. These “disconnected” young people face an uphill battle finding work and are at risk of economic hardship well into adulthood. Although there are many programs that aim to reconnect young people to education and employment, findings from evaluations of these programs have been mixed. The evidence base has grown substantially in the past several months, though, as studies of three pro\xadgrams — YouthBuild, Year Up, and New York City’s Young Adult Internship Program (YAIP) — have released new findings.\xa0MDRC’s Dan Bloom and Cynthia Miller recently wrote a brief that discusses findings from the new studies and their implications for youth programs. | Students who are placed into developmental (remedial) courses often fail to complete them, and many colleges and states are therefore interested in reforming developmental education. But what if students are not accurately placed into developmental courses in the first place? What if some of the students placed into developmental courses could have succeeded in college-level courses? Research suggests that standardized tests — the traditional method for placing students — actually does misplace substantial numbers of them. An alternative strategy is to place students using multiple measures of college readiness, including grade point averages, instead of a single test score. Join Katie Beal as she talks to MDRC’s Dan Cullinan and the Community College Research Center’s Elisabeth Barnett about early findings from a Center for the Analysis of Postsecondary Readiness study of systems that use multiple measures for placement, and about lessons for colleges interested in implementing these systems. | How should policymakers address the long-standing youth unemployment problem in Puerto Rico, which only worsened in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria? With support from the W. T. Grant Foundation, MDRC partnered with Instituto del Desarrollo de la Juventud, or the Youth Development Institute, to develop recommendations that can create pathways into the workforce for young people and that are supported by evidence-based and promising practices relevant to the current situation in Puerto Rico. Join Katie Beal as she talks to John Martinez, Director of Program Development at MDRC, about those recommendations and the challenges of implementing them.\xa0 | Career and technical education programs have taken on many different forms, but one that has been gaining in popularity is apprenticeships. Join Katie Beal as she talks to Noel Ginsberg, CEO of CareerWise Colorado, and Gretchen Morgan, former president of CareerWise Colorado, about the initiative that seeks to enlist hundreds of employers from many sectors to employ thousands of high school students in the nation’s first large-scale youth apprenticeship program. MDRC is currently working with CareerWise Colorado to help its leaders understand the factors that either impede or promote the smooth implementation of this complex initiative, so that the program can continue to improve. |  This summer Congress passed the long-awaited reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which governs the federal investment in career and technical education (CTE). But what do CTE programs actually do? And how have they evolved over time? Join Katie Beal as she talks to Mary Visher, a senior research associate at MDRC, about CTE programs — including their development and challenges. They also discuss MDRC’s two-decade history of constructing and evaluating\xa0CTE\xa0programs, including the landmark study of\xa0Career Academies, and the other\xa0CTE\xa0programs MDRC is currently partnering with to build evidence and inform\xa0policy and practice.\xa0  | Early math ability is one of the best predictors of children’s math and reading skills into late elementary school. Children with stronger math proficiency in elementary school are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college. But most early childhood programs don’t focus on math instruction. What kinds of math programs can improve children’s early math abilities? And can they lead to positive impacts for other longer-term outcomes? The Making Pre-K Count and High 5s demonstrations were designed to rigorously assess whether providing high-quality math instruction, aligned across prekindergarten (pre-K) and kindergarten, could lead to long-term gains across a variety of domains for students growing up in low-income communities in New York City. Making Pre-K Count and High 5s are the first studies of the Robin Hood Early Childhood Research Initiative, a partnership between Robin Hood and MDRC, which is supported with lead funding from the Heising-Simons Foundation, the Overdeck Family Foundation, and other funders.\xa0  MDRC’s findings show that these programs reduced the achievement gap in math skills between low-income children and their higher-income peers. Join Katie Beal as she talks to Shira Mattera, Research Associate at MDRC, and Robin Jacob, a Research Associate Professor at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, about the positive impacts of the Making Pre-K Count and High 5s demonstrations on kindergarten outcomes.', 'chan_desc': 'Policymakers talk about solutions, but which ones really work?

It would, quite cleverly, allow us to print off a bunch of letters all saying the same thing, but with a word or two – like a name – changed between each copy.It became commonplace for businesses. They could now print off hundreds of thousands of letters or bills or invoices quite quickly without poor Sandra having to manually update each one between printingFor a customer (or donor) it felt like they were the only ones that were getting that letter.That’s hard to imagine now, isn’t it? Getting a printed letter with your details on and just assuming someone had sat down and thought of you while they were typing it.But that was the point of mail merge: To allow a sender to send pretty much the same thing to a bunch of people. While the recipient felt like\xa0it was just for them.Everyone was happy.Nowadays,\xa0we use mail merge because we can.In today\'s Quick Tip, Simon talks through how to use mail merge in the most effective ways in your direct mail and emails.', 'chan_desc': "The fundraiser's fundraiser...talking all things fundraising, non-profits, charities, marketing and more.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/21/57/f2/2157f2f1-1c86-55d7-f3d6-f67657a45c84/mza_1154609406446769659.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2018-09-23'}}

I am convinced we have a leadership problem in our sector, and part of that problem is caused by the fact that we have nonprofit employees, specifically female employees, who do not envision themselves becoming executive level leaders. To this point, over 73% of nonprofit employees are women, but over 65% of nonprofit leaders are men. For the season 1 finale of the podcast, we dive into how we can begin to reimagine nonprofit leadership. Jill and Dawn share their leadership stories and discuss how gender expectations and gender roles have shaped their careers. We also explore how we can address this problem as employees, as parents, and as community leaders. We talk about how developing leaders can learn to take care of themselves, to develop their support network, and learn to gain the skills to become leaders. My hope is this podcast will help empower some of the smart, intelligent, passionate and talented female employuees in the nonprofit sector to begin to envision a world in which they become Executive Directors. This is my hope, because when the right people don’t step up, executive level jobs are filled by people of either gender who are not qualified, and that is hurting the nonprofit sector! \xa0 Mentioned in This Episode  Domestic Violence Crisis Center  Zarr Financial Services Independence, Inc.

Additionally, she is a consistent and vocal champion for issues and people who often go unnoticed and under-appreciated. In 2018, Del Val received the Emerging Leader award from the North Dakota Association of Nonprofit Organizations (NDANO). Additionally, she is a professional stage and commercial actor. She launched the original Legendary tourism ads for the state of North Dakota, but for some reason, everyone seems to focus on the Josh Duhamel ones instead.

A successful person will see how her ideas come full circle once a vision elevates rapidly. Meet Dr. Stacie N.C. Grant, Empowerment Specialist, Event Strategist, TV Media Host, Author and Speaker. She has witnessed an incredible turn-around in her life and business. And, as mind-blowing as it is, Grant can no longer hide the sizzling details. \xa0 Grant believes wholeheartedly in the mantra: Prayer is the key. Faith unlocks the door. She knows unfathomably that these are the primary ingredients needed behind every #Faithpreneur and entrepreneur to see their businesses excel. \xa0 She recently opened up about two life events that eventually led her in front of thousands of people globally. She remembers her first-grade teacher speaking to her mother about some behaviors on the first day of school. The teacher began the conversation with positive statements but went on to explain one problem. She mentioned how Grant gathered all the classmates and began teaching the students their ABCs. Speaking began for Grant at a young age, and this gift continued to nurture throughout middle school, high school, and college. \xa0 Her personality and gifts began to flourish abundantly through more experiences and encounters while growing up. But, there is one other memory that sparks and ignites her spirit to leap daily. It’s the sweet, savory recollections of her grandmother’s solid walk of faith in God. This bond was unique because Grant tuned into her gifts of prayer, speaking, and service to others through the actions of her grandmother. \xa0 “God was designing my life all along. I didn’t understand the real purpose, but now things are clearer to me,” she remarked. “Faith was the legacy my grandmother left us.” And, Grant continues to build on this legacy, which has carried her name, gifts, and business to the masses. \xa0 She felt challenged through this legacy of faith to be an entrepreneur and settled down the years of work into one movement: #Faithpreneur. \xa0 Her life and business took a pivotal turn at the heart of Times Square--the place where millions gather yearly to bring in the New Year. Grant’s new year from a legacy of faith began with her first tribute dinner celebrating her grandmother on her birthday in August, and leading prayer on a new platform. She holds a thriving prayer call every Saturday that connects with people ranging from the states, various countries, and islands. \xa0 “We pray over the intentions of what we desire to do, and for God to orchestrate the plans. This prayer call is no pomp and circumstance. It’s a time, where everybody shares,” stated Grant. \xa0\xa0 Moreover, the outcome of the celebration and turn out was mindblowing, causing her to launch #Faithpreneur Weekend to continue the legacy of her grandmother. Many of the prayer callers register for the conference. Grant defines a #Faithpreneur® as a “faith entrepreneur who exhibits grit, determination, and resilience to establish and monetize their business idea.” Grant teaches now the importance for every #Faithpreneur and entrepreneur to not only pray but understand the real purpose of growing a niche in business. “I thought everybody was my market,” she said. By recognizing this mistake, she began to clean up her marketing strategies and approach. Grant used an inquiry-based technique. The critical questions to niche-down are: Who is my avatar? What’s the trend in my business? Who comes and returns to me for services? What’s the pattern in my services? “I know it wasn’t gender-based in my business. It’s faith-based,” Grant acknowledged. \xa0Faithpreneur Weekend 2K19 guarantees that all attendees will depart with a plan of action for their businesses. Individuals are there to create “sustainable Revenue, Resources, and Relationships.” With a massive, organic reach over 1.3 million, Faithprenuer Weekend shows steady growth yearly.\xa0 Attendees arrive with their laptops ready to work. Each business owner will walk away with a definitive road map for sustainability and profitability. The atmosphere will be charged with faith-energy from guest honorees to trailblazing #Faithpreneurs who have established global brands, and more. \xa0“Faithpreneur Weekend isn’t like the traditional or typical events you attend. We equip all entrepreneurs and #faithpreneurs with tools to be change agents and to position themselves in the marketplace to help others,” remarked Grant. \xa0A new release for #faithpreneurs and entrepreneurs will penetrate the market. Grant will launch Destiny Designer University, a virtual platform for training and development in the fourth quarter of 2019. The virtual classroom encompasses capacity building, soft skills, emotional intelligence, presentation, and leadership skills. \xa0“I’ve learned the art of being in service to people. It’s through faith and service you are elevated. Elevation comes through service because of the education you receive,” Grant emphasized. \xa0Dr. Stacie N.C.Grant is the author of\xa0Action Action Despite the Distraction!: 7 Life Lessons to Thrive & Live Your Destiny.\xa0Dr. Stacie NC Grant also has the distinction of being one of world-renowned Les Brown’s notable Platinum Speakers and one of his expert trainers.\xa0 \xa0 Visit\xa0FaithpreneurWeekend.com for more information.

She continued her education at SVSU, earning a bachelor\'s degree in psychology.\xa0 Atkins then completed a law degree at the University of Detroit School of Law. After graduation, she became a lawyer and then was appointed the chief judge in Detroit\'s 36th District Court for 12 years until her retirement in 2012. After retiring from the bench, Atkins wrote her autobiography “The Triumph of Rosemary: A Memoir,” which was published in 2017. The memoir – at times raw and in other passages heartwarming – addresses important topics of diversity and social change. Born to an Italian teen and a married black man in Detroit in 1946, Atkins was adopted by a black couple in Saginaw. At age 19, she sparked a racial and religious scandal by marrying former Roman Catholic priest Thomas Lee Atkins, who was white and 25 years older than she. The couple had two biracial daughters, Elizabeth Ann Atkins and Catherine Marie Atkins Greenspan, who look white. The parents worked full time, and in a reversal of traditional gender roles, Marylin Atkins attended law school at night while Tom took the high-achieving girls to lessons for swim, piano, and skiing. Both daughters ultimately completed graduate degrees. Over time, family rifts resulting from the interracial marriage began to heal, fostering harmony and healing. The Atkins family\'s lifestyle includes friendships and associations with people of a cornucopia of race, religion, and culture. Atkins currently resides Detroit. Her late husband died in 1990. Their daughters created a publishing company, Two Sisters Writing and Publishing, which published “The Triumph of Rosemary.” Visit\xa0https://www.thetriumphofrosemary.com/ for more information Keep in contact with us,\xa0\xa0 sign up and get our free gift to YOU: https://drgenevaspeaks.com Follow our hashtag #ignite2impact \xa0Please share this podcast & let us what you think, *subscribe in iTunes and leave a review \xa0', 'chan_desc': 'Conversations with leaders that are igniting their community, our nation and the world to be a better place.

To learn more, you can reach Tameka@tamekanallen.com or grab her FREE Facebook Ads Checklist here! | Telling your nonprofit story is not about your value propositions or how you do what you do. The perfect story is always the “why?” You know, the real people involved and the “why” behind it all. Grab these three easy steps so that prospective donors and partners understand who you really are and why they should care.\xa0 STEP ONE Who are you? Melanie and I recently presented a workshop at the Nonprofit Learning Lab in Phoenix and an attendee asked me about their mission statement. It was old and no longer represented their brand and could not be changed. Mission statements are internal documents to guide the board and staff. It doesn’t necessarily define who you are as an organization. Understand who you are! \xa0 STEP TWO What’s the plot?  Beating the Odds Rags to Riches Rebirth The Quest The Mystery The Voyage & Return  Each plot needs to include a challenge, and conflicts, along with the call to action, growth or outcome \xa0 STEP THREE Who’s the hero of the story? Are they willing or unwilling? Are they tragic, a loner, a catalyst, or cynic, or an unsung hero? \xa0 Extra Tips Don’t forget to ask. “Who cares?” at the end of each sentence that you write. If you answer that question honestly and you don\'t think anyone will care... re-write it or omit the sentence. People respond to threes, so write your story titles that way. Consider The Three Little Pigs; The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, or Three Blind Mice Follow this link to check out a FREE Story Structure Diagram that will help you lock down your nonprofit’s perfect story.\xa0 If you like what you’re hearing, don’t be shy.

Learn how to get those email addresses by following this simple plan: 1) Control Your Ask Don’t you find it so annoying to start reading an interesting story and a dumb subscription form pops up. Always ask “after the feel good moment” and then ask again and again but not all on the same page. In order to specify the perfect time when a pop-up should be triggered, first you need to take a look at your analytics to determine the average time spent on your website. Best practices show that setting the timing to 60% of the average time spent on site can be an effective timing. If this is beyond your current capacity then do what Unbounce suggests. What 60 seconds before allowing your opt-in pop-up or slide-in to appear. If your visitors have spent 60 seconds browsing your website, they have already shown an adequate amount of engagement and presumably they understand the main message of your site – and 60 seconds isn’t so much time that you lose a lot of potential subscribers. 2) Relevant Requests Only Please Don’t make the mistake of having subscription forms with messages that are unrelated to the content on the page. Usually, this applies to websites on which content addresses multiple different topics. Many sites like this create a generic subscription CTA that appears on every page regardless of content. While these unrelated offerings or CTAs might convert get some readers to sign up, it’s not the best strategy for attracting new subscribers. 3) Color Matters Different colors are associated with different emotions, and these emotions can have a direct effect on how people behave. Colors can also form a strong association with your brand. Using a color scheme that isn’t consistent with your brand or complementary with itself can have a negative impact on the perception of your business. This will drive users away from subscribing to your newsletter or emails. To help you out, you’ll find a downloadable color | emotion chart that I use in brand discovery and alignment workshops in the show notes. 4) Exit Overlays It’s a love-hate relationship. You may hate them but those pop-ups and slide-in opt-in forms really work. In fact the best place to give website visitors a last chance to sign up is when they are ready to exit your website. A friendly reminder, through exit offer technology, that they haven’t signed up yet increases opt-in by an additional 27%. It’s called exit offer technology and it uses the science of behavioral targeting, personalization and content discovery to give your visitors the right offer at the right time, substantially increasing the odds that they’ll convert. Picreel, among others, provide this type of technology. https://www.picreel.com/#how-it-works-section Another tactic for another episode is the art of the CTA and social signups. 5) Use Your Opt-in for Segmentation Let your site visitors select whether they are interested in volunteering, donating, or hosting a fundraising event. Or you can also get the email address quickly and painlessly first, then direct your subscriber to a preferences page. Check out the Land’s End screen shot that we’ve included on the show notes page. 6) Test Your Opt-in What happens if someone puts in an incomplete email or if they abandon the form? What do they see and what is the message? And don’t forget to look at the form on a smart device to make certain that it is optimized for viewing. Also, avoid the word “submit” where possible, it’s just as simple to use more descriptive and fun “Sign Me Up” or “Subscribe.” 7) Thank You Thank or welcome subscribers immediately by reminding them what they will be receiving and why they are so amazing for joining your tribe. Big tip: Allow subscribers to social share your opt-in. Check out the Chairish.com Share the Love screenshot in the show notes.

Sounds simple right? It is simple. “A great way to approach a business would be, ‘We love what you do! Can you help us out?’” Matt should know, his Bonjoro app can take you from “ZERO TO HERO” in donor cultivation with three simple steps. 1) Connect your Bonjoro to your CRM. 2) As soon as you are notified that an online donation has been made via your smart phone, immediately *record a Bonjoro customized, video from the same phone. 3) Push send and be prepared to be amazed! You’ve now created a super fan. You no longer have to send that tired, old welcome (or thank you) email to your donors. A Bonjoro video email is SO much more effective in cultivating donors. And, Bonjoro is set up so that it isn’t a big drain on your time. Melanie has been using Bonjoro at The House of Refuge for 90 days.

Take your video anywhere, at anytime so that your donors see that you are real and authentic. Trust us, they are not interested in polished “you” instead they are interested in the fact that you took time to thank them right away. It works! \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 |  |  | SHOW NOTES 1) SPEED A fast loading website has 3 benefits: User Experience –no one will take the time to sit and wait for a site to load when there are thousands of other sites offering similar content. A slow loading website always results in a higher bounce rate and more importantly, a bad user experience. Google Search Ranking Improves –a website that loads slowly definitely ranks low in\xa0Google search ranking. Facebook Advertising – who wants to pay more? A slow website means that you will pay more for your Facebook boosted posts ad campaigns. HOW FAST IS FAST? Ideally, Google likes it to be 2secs but anything within 5-6 secs is still fine. You can check your site load time by using\xa0Pingdom,\xa0or\xa0Google speed check. Check desktop and mobile. Pay attention to these other three tasks to improve your website speed.  Hosting Plan Compress Your Images Fix Broken Links (FB bots are checking this and you could be labeled as Spam or Phising  \xa0 2) CONTENT ALWAYS INCLUDE A CALL TO ACTION Ideally, you should be including a call to action on every single page of your website, but ESPECIALLY on the ABOUT PAGE. If you aren\'t directly showing people where they need to be going on your website, they will bounce around and then just leave. BUT if your About Page resonates with them, that is the one place with the lowest barrier to entry (meaning it is the place on your website where they are 50% more likely to click your call to action button) and reach out to you.\xa0 \xa0 SPEAK TO YOUR IDEAL DONOR, NOT AT THEM If you\'re not wording things in a way that is speaking to them you will not resonate with them because you aren\'t speaking their love language. What’s their love language? They NEED to be cast as the Hero or Rescuer. Since we’re talking about love language. Here’s a question to ask yourself: Why are my top donors in love with our cause? That’s the language you use to talk to your ideal donor. Just remember - This isn’t about YOU, the nonprofit. It’s about the donor, the partner, and the volunteer. Donors want to be part of your brand, and your growth, and your story. GIVE YOUR CONTACT PAGE SOME LOVE \xa0The goal of any website is to convert a tire kicker into a donor, volunteer, or business partner. Your contact page is the perfect place to remind them why they want to be part of your tribe.  First, make sure that your contact page form is easy to use. You want to get their important information, so you can reach back out to them, but also have a place for them to request specific information or ask questions. It’s also a good idea to set the expectation for your audience. Let them know when they can expect an answer from you. Include an image of the person who will be responding to the contact request with a short personal note.  The Cause Café Podcast 2018. All rights reserved. | SHOW NOTES Why is Email Such A Big Deal? The answer is actually pretty obvious. You own this database and these people have given you permission to connect with them! Additionally, you want to be where your prospects are… and (for most) they are still checking their email all day, everyday.  Email is one of the highest ROI activities in your business…(NONPROFITS enjoy a whopping 34.44% open rate) Email engages & nurtures both prospects and customers to generate new leads and sales Email can be automated so that you can literally prospect and sell around the clock (even while you sleep)  Isn\'t Email Marketing Dead? I get asked this question all the time. Email is not dead but it is abused. That’s because email is not a sales tool but IT IS the perfect nurturing tool. Email is Definitely Here to Stay People will send and receive\xa0more than 269 billion emails per day in 2018. There will be an expected 3.7 billion email users worldwide by the end of the year and in 5 years’ time, there’ll be even more email… with an expected 319.6 billion emails sent. 90% OF US USE EMAIL EVERYDAY – 74% YOUNG PEOPLE STILL USE IT DAILY. Presidential candidates typically raise more than $500 million dollars in email alone! How’s that for some serious statistics?\xa0 Best Practices:  Give readers value: educate and entertain | announcements | the backstory | giveaways Include links to information… 5-7 links are optimum 20 lines of text and 3-4 images results in the best click through rates Best day of the week to send an email is Tuesday Best time of the day: 10-11am or 2-4pm and 6pm have the highest click through rates Consistency pays off Required footer information (don’t forget the legal stuff guys!) Automate your email  In Episode 008 we cover the 13 Deadliest Email Marketing Sins so head over there and have a listen. In case you don’t have time for that episode, here are the Top 3 Email Marketing Sins. #1 You don’t treat your email like it’s your social feed. Post like you do on Facebook and be certain to follow the analytics to see what’s working and then keep refining your messages and subject lines. Plan to measure the open rate (21%) and the click through rate (3.5%). The more relevant and personalized the email, the higher the rates. #2 Your subject Line is boring Take more time with your subject line than you do with your email content. The subject line should be high-impact and leave the reader wanting to know more.  Personalize your email 75% higher open rate 170 – 179 characters have the highest open rate  “What is your biggest question for me?” “2 things today” “This saved a life” “You coming?” “hey ª””Why not you?” #3 You write like a stiff corporate robot Yes, you! You write like a stiff, corporate robot. Readers like writing that’s relaxed and conversational. So don’t be so formal and for the love… don’t send an email with grammatical mistakes. Grammatical errors imply that, at best, you’re careless — and they’ll put off your potential partners. “But wait. I’m a terrible writer.”  Write like you talk. Record yourself. Read once out loud. Listen to see if that’s how you talk to people. If not rewrite it. After those changes, read it out loud again and ask yourself – “who cares?” This will improve your relevancy.  Don’t forget!

PERSONAL RANT ALERT: I think that meetings to EXCHANGE information (unless it’s a really big announcement) are a huge waste of time. Meetings that are meant for brainstorming or collaboration are energizing and amazing. The others are a snooze-fest. What’s even worse is that you are taking people away from the “real” work so in order to meet deadlines and expectations they work late into the night or over the weekend. The Mamas at The Cause Cafe are here to rescue you from bad, stinky cheese meetings. Let\'s do this!  If you think your meetings go on and on consider implementing “Stand Up” meetings. It’s a military thing and it works. Unless it’s a question to clarify something, you can request that people reserve questions for another time or better yet, have questions sent to you by email. I love shoes! REALLY love them. But I had to impose a limit on myself. If I purchase a new pair of shoes, I have to move an older pair out. Meetings are the same. If you have two weekly meetings scheduled – let’s say one for staff and one for your executive team, and someone wants to add another meeting first ask them if you can add it to the agenda of the two standing, scheduled meetings. If that can’t or shouldn’t be done, then ask see about canceling one of your scheduled meetings (send an email instead – everyone will thank you). If you’re not 10 minutes early to a meeting, you’re late. Don’t be a Monopolizing Monger. This means that you don’t always have to share every thought, idea, or solution that pops into your head. If you are worried that you are That Person, the next time a question is asked count to 10 slowly before you provide an answer. I’ve learned that some people process information quickly and some take more time to process and come up with a solution or comment. Give other people the opportunity to participate. If you’re worried that you won’t get that really great idea out there, write it down and share it by email later. This will not only make you a better listener but your credibility will improve because you took time with your answer. For the LOVE… use AGENDA. 3M did a study of 900 meetings held in different US companies and found that 69% did not use an agenda. And uhhh… make sure that someone is in charge. We need a leader in the meeting to moderate, encourage, provide clarity, and summarize. Smartphones in presentations are acceptable… not so in meeting. Put your darn device away. Do not criticize or discipline an employee in a meeting. There are no bad ideas… they are just ideas at this point. Write EVERY idea down on a whiteboard – ideas are the springboard to MORE! M = Mind-Blowing, C = Creative, O = Openness, R = Respect, and E = Energy.  Asana, a work and productivity application, suggests that every organization establish one day a week as a “no meeting” day so that employees can have an uninterrupted day or work. Once around the room! Give everyone the opportunity to speak at the end of the meeting by saying, “Okay once around the room. Does anyone have anything to add? We’ll start with you _____.” Most will have nothing to add but sometimes you end up with a insightful, really helpful comment. Someone has to take notes (AKA minutes) especially if tasks are to be assigned. It keeps everyone awake and honest about their assignments and deadlines.\xa0  BONUS: Favorite Apps - Digital Marketing Meeting Tools Slack could significantly reduce meetings and your nonprofit and may even replace email. It’s basically a cloud-based program and app that let’s your employees create groups or workspaces to talk to each other, share files, send notifications and more. The other great benefits of Slack are that you can create channels or basically conversations around different topics. This means that you’re only inviting certain people to specific channels based on who really needs to be there. Also you can send direct messages to people while you are engaged in chatting with everyone in your channel. Example: you ask for an update on an upcoming event in your Slack channel. The other employees who have been invited to the event channel are immediately notified that you have asked a question. They jump in and respond, collaborate, clarify. While this is happening, you realize that the website has not been changed to reflect a change to the event. So you send a direct message to Mr. IT to fix it ASAP while the channel conversation is ongoing. Rally lets you create a simple, straightforward poll where attendees can vote on a day for an event that works best\xa0for them. It also includes an open comment\xa0section on the meeting page, so attendees can plan the meeting agenda or discuss details before the event. Assistant.to lets you work directly\xa0from\xa0Gmail and Google Calendar to select available meeting times and share those open slots with the person you\'re trying to schedule a meeting with. Pick automatically scans everyone\'s Gmail calendars to find open slots, and then delivers a list of mutually available times. You can then send a calendar invite to all attendees directly from the app. Calendly integrates directly with your Google or Office 365\xa0calendar,and gives you a personalized URL where people can view your availability and schedule times to meet you. They offer a basic free\xa0plan,and a paid premium plan that allows for group scheduling and\xa0other additional features. If you’re looking for a change of scenery to pump up your staff consider hosting an off-site meeting. EventUp.com is like the AirBNB for meeting spaces.\xa0 Or check out Kapow. This website provides direct “corporate events in non-traditional venues” booking tool in 21 U.S. cities. Group activities include team building, in-store retail events, entertainment tickets, cocktail receptions and dining experiences. | SHOW NOTES Since there is a lot of confusion about, "What are the best nonprofit marketing strategies?" we decided that it is high-time we share our 4 favorites. Let’s go! Event Marketing Simply defined. Event Marketing is any fundraising or educational activity that bring people together in a social interaction. Examples include tours, galas, concerts, golf tournaments, and auctions. These types of events can bring in a ton of revenue but they require a lot of resources: like time and money. TIP: Events can be risky and often don’t produce the revenue you’re counting on. To help you determine which activities are worth the effort, we’re adding a link to a fantastic Classy.org blog post that shows which events have the highest ROI.  https://www.classy.org/blog/which-type-of-fundraising-event-is-best-for-your-nonprofit/ TIP: Even though Event Marketing typically has a low audience reach and can be costly to produce, events tend to score high for retention and generating new leads because of the solid face-to-face time you get with people. \xa0 Content Marketing Content Marketing is the creation and promotion of content assets to generate brand awareness, traffic growth, lead generation, or donations. In order for it to work, you will need to give prospects valuable, relevant, shareable “snuggets” (snackable nuggets of information awesomeness). Content Marketing includes video/audio, image with content, blog posts, social media posts, and digital newsletters or emails. The first place to look to see if your content is filled with snuggets is your website. As you are reviewing the copy, images, and video ask yourself this question, “Who cares?” If the awesomeness is not there, then rewrite your content again and again until you get it right. Next, begin posting more articles like blogs and make sure that you have a spot-on newsletter. And please don’t forget the power of video… especially on social media platforms. TIP: You’ll get 94% more views on your post or website with video. Content Marketing is the perfect strategy to employ for improved retention or if you have a smaller budget. \xa0 Influencer Marketing Influencer Marketing refers to finding the right people who happen to have a strong online presence. If your values line up and you pitch them correctly they will influence their followers or subscribers to donate, volunteer, etc. to your nonprofit. Think of it as word-of-mouth marketing to the power of 10! Influencers can be bloggers, journalists, authors, consultants, analysts, etc. The most valuable influencers typically have:  A strong online presence with influence over potential donors and partners The ability and reputation to align with your brand and mission Built a ton of credibility and trust with their audience  \xa0TIP: This is almost always a pay to play strategy. \xa0Digital Marketing The short definition for Digital Marketing is using digital technology to reach potential donors, volunteers, and partners. We cannot get enough of it! Here’s why: Something as simple as putting videos up on your website can increase your Google first page ranking up to 50%. Tip: Digital Marketing costs less too… up to 62% less than traditional marketing plus it has the highest potential reach. Some common examples of Digital Marketing are:  SEM (Search Engine Marketing Paid Search also known as PPC SEO (Search Engine Marketing /no cost strategies include: how fast your page loads, if your content is relevant, if your content is fresh, using header tags, and ensuring that your images are the right size and format CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) Facebook, Instagram and other social platform (organic and paid) Funnels & Email Nurturing Campaigns Landing Pages Video Infographics Earned online publicity (reviews – social proof, links to your website, digital articles and blog posts written about your organization)  \xa0 BONUS MATERIAL \xa0 Affinity and Affiliate Marketing People often get confused about the difference between Affinity Marketing and Affiliate Marketing. Basically Affinity Marketing is just another name for a referral program. You go about it by forming relationships and partnering with different businesses and organizations to reach a wider audience. Another option is that you offer a discounted service or product to your donor base. Every sale nets a percentage back to your nonprofit. This type of program works best if: 1) The product or service aligns with your mission 2) The company you partner with has the same values and standards 3) The company doesn’t expect you to do all the heavy lifting (they should help you market the partnership to their database, put your logo and link to your website on their own, and provide you with ideas, strategies, and materials) 4) There’s a set fundraising goal and people know they are funding something specific Affinity Marketing is the most challenging strategies to pull together but the rate of return can also the highest. Affiliate Marketing is a pure performance-based relationship. Example. You sell someone else’s products or services and get rewarded for doing it. Tip: Amazon Smile is the perfect example of an affinity program. Thanks for stopping in at The Cause Café.

Today, it supports schools, colleges and universities across their external engagement work advancing education to transform lives and society.\xa0 CASE’s scope is much broader than fundraising; focusing also in marketing, communications, alumni engagement and even government relations – they drive forward integrated advancement.\xa0Sue notes that CASE is heavily involved in research and have launched a resource called ‘AM Atlas’ that provides educational advancement-related metrics, benchmarks and analytics. It’s comprised of several member-based surveys, as well as custom and funded research on specific topics.\xa0Among some of the trends Sue is witnessing, she specifically references that philanthropy and the scale of giving is increasing for higher education across the globe. \xa0Interestingly, they’ve recently launched a survey that highlighted for the third time that British universities raised over one billion pounds. The drivers for this are likely a combination of investing in leadership and the generosity of philanthropists.\xa0A few weeks ago, CASE launched a survey that will, for the first time, be tracking alumni engagement metrics, globally, in a comprehensive manner. Instead of focusing exclusively on the proportion of alumni who give back, this new survey will include volunteerism, mentoring, advocacy, career advice, internships and helping with governance, to name a few.\xa0When asked about public attitudes towards universities, Sue noted that it’s important for universities to build a strong public understanding of the important work that universities are doing in areas such as research and community engagement – beyond education. Indeed, while there is much to be proud of, Sue notes there is also much to be done in terms of public attitudes and public perception around higher education – especially in light of current conversations around social mobility and state funding.\xa0Some of the focus areas for Sue and CASE right now include enhancing their digital offering, continuing to develop great research and streamlining the organisation’s governance.\xa0Recently, CASE launched a new website that hosts a wide range of resources and they’re looking at building out their e-learning offering beyond the webinars they’ve been doing for many years. \xa0Sue goes on to underscore the importance of their data and research offering – under the banner of AM Atlas – and \xa0notes it’s critical for institutions to be able to dig deep, benchmark, learn from others and understand what success looks like.\xa0CASE has three main sources of funding: (1) membership model from the 3,600 institutions it supports; (2) income from the more than 120 in-person institutes and conferences they run annually in 20 countries – last year they catered to 20,000 participants; and (3) income from philanthropists and educational partners (such as for-profit consultants, search firms, and research agencies).\xa0Volunteering is a key component of CASE’s operations. They have about 4,000 people who volunteer for CASE annually in some capacity, such as by mentoring others, teaching on programs, speaking at CASE conferences, and helping with governance and key strategic initiatives. Indeed, it was through volunteering that Sue found herself as a contender for her current role at CASE.\xa0Key takeaway: Sue takes the opportunity to thank and recognise advancement professionals and philanthropists for their transformative work and impact; she encourages them to look for ways to communicate the impact of the academic institutions they’re affiliated with and to do so in succinct and powerful ways.\xa0Visit Lidji.org for guest bios, episode notes and useful links.

Because once we know each other it’s much harder to dislike one another – it’s about finding a common humanity.\xa0Globally, there is an international charter office and approximately 500+ different chapters across the world; 197 of these chapters are located in the USA.\xa0 It’s a grassroots movement and every chapter looks different and is independent.\xa0What is compassion? Well, for some it might be compassion for the Earth, or compassion for children and youth, or compassion for people who are incarcerated. Leanne notes that compassion has many faces.\xa0Part of her job and that of Compassionate Atlanta is to listen to the community and look to them for guidance. There’s one program they’re running with the Sierra Club looking at compassion and climate.\xa0When asked what it takes to start a local chapter in one’s own community, Leanne points listeners to the Charter for Compassion website, where one can sign up and find out more – there are ways of engaging for cities, businesses and individuals. Indeed, some cities can twin with each other and mentor one another.\xa0Compassion is overarching and it’s for everybody. Yes, there is a strong interfaith component but, also, there’s an appreciation that faith itself can be divisive. Compassion is for people of all faiths as well as for those with none. Representing people of different faiths is just as important as representing the secular community.\xa0 It’s about everyone coming together.\xa0Leanne likes to focus on similarities rather than differences. This is particularly important in today’s politically divided and polarised environment.\xa0 Her advice: start by tackling the conversations that are easy and make progress from there. There’s no need to start by talking about people’s voting intentions. Why not start by exchanging preferences and experiences about food, film, the arts? Build a rapport and take it from there.\xa0Being compassionate isn’t just good for individuals and cities in communities across the world. It is also important for businesses and, as Leanne points out, can have a positive effect on customer service and employee retention; it can lead to happier and more productive employees. She specifically references the CEO of LinkedIn, who has spoken about compassion in a corporate setting.\xa0Leanne recognises that sometimes businesses don’t like the word compassion because it may feel ‘soft’ but, actually, she remarks that compassion is really ‘strong’.\xa0In a business setting, compassion takes many forms and can be facilitated by getting employees around the table, being inclusive, having fluid communications and simply asking employees what makes them happy in their job. It’s about small incremental changes and can have a positive influence across the whole organisation.\xa0\xa0Leanne’s Key takeaway: Treat others as you wish to be treated; and treat others as they wish to be treated. Know that you can make an incredible difference and that one person can really shift the world for another.\xa0Visit Lidji.org for guest bios, episode notes and useful links.

They have a strong focus on fellowship,\xa0charitable work and business activity.\xa0Many people outside of the UK are not familiar with the world of livery companies and, even within the UK, there is often a lack of understanding on what livery companies do, how they’re governed and the process to join one.\xa0\xa0Stephen does a wonderful job of taking listeners through a multi-faceted exploration of the livery company world and the Coopers’ in particular, of which he is CEO.\xa0Today, there are 110 livery companies in England and, since the 1970s, approximately 30 new livery companies have been established.\xa0\xa0There are three main types of collaborations between different livery companies. There is a collaboration between ‘The Great 12’ livery companies (these are the top 12 livery companies based on their wealth ranking back in the 16th Century. Today, these 12 may not necessarily be the wealthiest but the tradition of the Great 12 stands); then there is a collaboration between companies that have a ‘hall’; and lastly there’s collaboration between those companies that have no hall and are not one of the Great 12.\xa0Livery companies in the UK are amongst the largest philanthropic donors in the country.\xa0\xa0In addition to supporting members of the coopers trade (cask makers), the company also supports two schools in the UK and makes grants based on the funding applications it receives from interested parties.\xa0Stephen notes how the coopers trade is witnessing something\xa0of a renaissance in England, now that the country's\xa0sparkling wines are increasingly being recognised for their quality on the international stage. It’s an exciting time for coopers / cask makers in England.\xa0Stephen’s key takeaway for listeners: he\xa0refers to the Company’s motto -- Love is Brethren – and laments consumerism and greed.\xa0\xa0He would like to see people with abundant resources be more philanthropic and spread their wealth more generously. Give back to society as much as you can!\xa0\u200bVisit Lidji.org for guest bios, episode notes and useful links. Please subscribe to the podcast if you enjoy it. Thank you!\xa0 | CEO of United World Schools (UWS), Tim Howarth, joins Alberto Lidji to shed light on their 200 schools in Cambodia, Myanmar and Nepal and to celebrate their 2019 WISE Award for educational innovation.\xa0UWS is one of 2019’s WISE Award Winners (World Innovation Summit for Education). They were presented a WISE Award for their innovative approach and scalable model; they have had 30,000 schoolchildren through their schools in the past 10 years; they have strong public/private partnerships; and they’re extremely focused on empowering local communities.\xa0UWS started off as a small family charity in the UK and over the past decade has built 200 schools in communities across Cambodia, Myanmar and Nepal that previously had no access to education – they embrace a model that is low cost, scalable, replicable and simple; a typical school has approximately 150-200 children and is located in remote areas of their respective countries, where local communities are often ethnic minorities that do not speak the national language. Furthermore, these communities are usually at or below the poverty line.\xa0 UWS are unequivocal in their stance: local communities need to be empowered, they need to be part of the solution and they need to be involved as new schools are built.\xa0When asked what prompted UWS to enter and operate in Cambodia, Myanmar and Nepal, Tim mentioned this was driven by a mix of strategy, fit and opportunity. They initially had connections in Cambodia, which presented a good opportunity to enter that market.\xa0 Subsequently, as they began to scale up successfully they considered what other countries might be in need of their work and that took them to Mynamar and Nepal. \xa0Could Vietnam or other countries be next? Indeed, that may well be the case in the years to come.\xa0Tim and the team at United World Schools have ambitions to grow, reach many more schoolchildren, expand geographically and help achieve Goal 4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all.\xa0Tim’s key takeaway: Be absolutely focused on delivering your mission – use it as your North Star!\xa0Visit Lidji.org for full episode notes, guest bios and useful links.

Thank you! | Executive Director at Innovation Edge, Sonja Giese, joins Alberto Lidji to discuss their impact investment platform and innovative strategies in support of Early Childhood Development in South Africa.\xa0Sonja joined the podcast from Cape Town, South Africa. \xa0Innovation Edge is focused on early childhood development (ECD) investments in South Africa. They’re a platform designed to promote innovation in ECD (ages 0 to 6) set up to try to bring innovation in to tackle the multiple challenges preventing children from thriving.\xa0Sonja notes that the reality in South Africa is that more than half of children are starting school without the right learning foundations in place.\xa0Innovation Edge was originally set up by a group of funders who had a shared interest in ECD and had been investing in this field in a traditional grant-making way. But they were facing intractable problems and were interested in finding new ways to tackle them. They each put funds into a pooled fund and Sonja was tasked with sourcing investments that were a good fit for that fund.\xa0The funders had to be very aligned; moving away from traditional grant-making and realising that there is a very high degree of risk in this type of fund, since they source very early stage ideas, often even before there being any proof of feasibility or proof of concept.\xa0This is critical if you’re going to drive innovation in such a nascent area – the funders had to have similar risk appetites.\xa0 All the funders and Sonja agreed that if they weren’t failing enough then they weren’t pushing the boundaries of innovation enough. This is something Sonja found very inspiring.\xa0When asked whether deal flow origination was difficult, she replied that indeed it was “hugely challenging”. Sourcing deals is difficult and Innovation Edge continue to experiment with different sourcing strategies -- they need to be very active and, at times, even co-create ideas.\xa0The team at Innovation Edge is diverse. Interestingly, out of a team of 8, Sonja is actually the only one who comes from a traditional development background. Others come from entrepreneurship, start-ups; impact investing, financial instruments.\xa0 They want people who have diverse experiences, networks and ways of thinking.\xa0They struggle to define the exact label for the investments that they do; and whether they’re labelled as impact investments, social investments, ESG-integrated investments really is influenced to a great deal on their target audience. They spend a lot of time trying to find “the label”.\xa0At Innovation Edge, they like making very unlikely connections between people and ideas – connections that would otherwise not come together were it not for Innovation Edge.\xa0As far as the types of investments they make: they like to think of themselves as an “impact first investor”. They do both investments and also traditional grant-making, if appropriate. There are instances when they’ve taken equity in some start-ups and, also, experimented with outcome-based models and other variations. They try to bring flexible resources and a flexible approach to resourcing.\xa0Sonja describes their core fund as an ‘evergreen fund’. Any returns that are made are reinvested back into that fund. So, none of their investors in that core fund expect a financial return.\xa0However, what many of these investors may have is a particular preference for investing in one or many of the diverse initiatives that come down Innovation Edge’s deal flow pipeline, and then they have the opportunity to make direct investments into some of these and they can then negotiate the terms of that directly.\xa0 Irrespective of the various approaches, Innovation Edge aims to stay engaged to ensure that the investment remains mission-aligned; and indeed investors may well need to be willing to forego some financial returns in order to maximise social returns.\xa0Different funders have different appetites for risk. Some funders are not prepared to put in funding for something that hasn’t been proven. So part of the challenge is in connecting funders to the right opportunity. Thematically, some investors may be more interested in investing in EdTech (education technology) while others may care about other types of investment areas.\xa0Sonja introduced listeners to their “Think Future” conference, which happens every two years and is due to take place later on in 2019.\xa0 She explains that at Innovation Edge, they look at their activities in three buckets:\xa01 – Commissioning Innovation (i.e. how they find and make investments)\xa02 – Communicating Innovation (i.e. what they do; what they’ve learned; what tools they can share with others)3 – Connecting for Innovation (this is vital -- \xa0they have a number of strategies to make these connections.\xa0Think Future is their flagship event and characterises their approach to making these connections.\xa0The first Think Future conference was held in 2017; the second is coming up in late 2019. It curates a program that stimulates unusual thoughts and links between concepts and participants. They’ll be hosting 250 participants from 20 countries in South Africa. Interestingly, half of those who will be attending don’t work in the early childhood space. The conference is about bringing new and disruptive ideas to bear on the challenges facing early childhood development. At Innovation Edge, they want people to leave the event with a fresh perspective on how they can do things differently and apply their thinking to make an impact.\xa0Over the years, Innovation Edge has developed some invaluable internal tools, which revolve around the strategies they’ve used to source and stimulate an ecosystem in ECD; tools for tracking the progress of their investments – they have a tool that tracks investments from source to scale – which has 7 steps with a set of questions that must be answered in every step.\xa0At Innovation Edge, they view these tools as a public good – they’re more than happy to share these tools with others across the globe. “it is an absolute delight” to share these tools with others. Part of the rationale is that when others engage with Innovation Edge’s tools and give feedback, it helps Innovation Edge grow, learn and add value. They welcome collaboration at all levels and from every geographic corner.\xa0Some of their main international funders include: the Omidyar Network, the UBS Optimus Foundation and ELMA Philanthropies. (NB: you can listen to The Do One Better! Podcast interviews with both the heads of UBS Optimus and ELMA Philanthropies at Lidji.org). Despite Innovation Edge’s focus on making investments in South Africa, Sonja notes that international funders help foster a cross pollination of ideas.\xa0When asked what success looks like in the next 10 years, Sonja noted that there are two things that they’re hoping to achieve:\xa01 - Pipeline: they want to really demonstrate their ability to take highly impactful innovations from source all the way to sustainable scale. This is very challenging to do in a field such as ECD.2 - Purpose:\xa0 this focuses on target 4.2 of the SDGs (UN Sustainable Development Goals), which tracks the percentage of children who are developmentally on track before they enter school. For Innovation Edge, they’ve really aligned their goals to that specific SDG indicator. They’d really like to see many more children starting school with the right foundations for learning.\xa0\xa0They’ve commissioned a tool to track child outcomes to answer this question. It’s now been standardised for the South African population; it’s available in all 11 languages and it’s been widely used. The other thing they’ve done is to partner with business and with the South African Government to motivate the use of this tool to actually establish an ‘Early Years Index’.\xa0 They’d like to do a national sample of children every 3 to 5 years to be able to track whether over time they’re getting progressively close to the ideal of having 100% of children starting school on track.\xa0The tracking of returns on investment is challenging. They’ve developed some metrics that they believe can be generically applied across a diverse portfolio. Over the past 4.5 years since they’ve been making investments they’ve made 36 investments and these are focused in three types of things:\xa01 – Product / service2 – Platforms that are already at scale where they leverage the platform for social impact3 – Data tools and insights\xa0For each one of these they have clear targets of where different types of investment should be at different stages of their cycle. These can be targets around prototypes – having a good working prototype – a viable revenue or funding model, a strong team in place etc -- and ensuring that over time they’re moving to becoming sustainable and scalable.\xa0On the topic of Social Returns and Outcomes, Sonja notes they focus on:\xa01 – Achieving greater efficiency / effectiveness in government systems. If you achieve this you could have potential to impact the lives of millions of children.\xa02 – Impact to shift the ways in which ECD practitioners or teachers are operating in the classroom; or the way parents are engaging with their children. Actual change in behaviours that will improve outcomes.3 – Child outcomes – they look at 7 developmental domains and they look at the way their investments have improved these outcomes.\xa0The team at Innovation Edge work closely with management teams and this can be very time consuming. An interesting observation is that the financial investment is actually the smallest part of the ‘value-add’. Typically, their investments are not very big; they give around $80k in an initial investment round and then they can do repeat investments but typically the value they bring is much more hands on, by sitting on boards, helping organizations navigate complex government dynamics and relationships, business modelling, legal support, networking and strategic support. Sometimes they really are very operational and that’s why they don’t ever anticipate their portfolio growing very large -- they aim to make 6 to 10 investments per annum.\xa0Sonja’s key takeaway for listeners: It’s important to find those connections between what you’re good at and what’s needed.\xa0 She notes that people tend to compartmentalize their lives. For instance, one might be a very successful business person and then in their spare time they might do some work for a charity that is completely different from the skillset they’ve developed in their business careers. \xa0At Innovation Edge, what they’re trying to unlock is the way to connect these different things – where she sees that people can really add value is in that ‘aha’ moment between what their core competences and skillset are and the desperate need that there is out there. It’s at this point that people can really make exponential contributions.\xa0Visit Lidji.org for full episode notes, guest bios and useful links.

These include: ACEV (the Mother Child Education Foundation); the Özyegin Foundation; Özyegin University; and then various other smaller initiatives.\xa0Their investments are 90% in education. And, approximately 70% to 80% of Özyegin Social Investments’ funding comes from the Özyegin family.\xa0The organisation was founded by Hüsnü Özyegin, who’s a highly philanthropic, self-made billionaire in Turkey.\xa0They have deployed $525m in philanthropic funds in Turkey and directly impacted 1.5m lives.\xa0Ayla explains how she’s very fortunate to manage both an international foundation and local charitable activities on the ground as well.\xa0 She sheds light on the contrast and peculiar dynamics between international organisations and local NGOs; and also highlights the implications of being a family foundation – especially one where the Founder is still alive and active.\xa0She notes that, indeed, there are differences between working ‘on the ground’ locally vs working ‘in the Boardroom’ internationally.\xa0 On the international level, it is very easy to get removed from reality – especially in over-professionalised organisations where, perhaps, there’s too much mimicking of a private sector approach. Nevertheless, a global outlook is important and there is much value to be derived from the global insights, trends and experience that global foundations and international organisations can bring to the local market.\xa0Ayla mentions that dialogue between these various types of organisations is key and, importantly, it needs to be on equal footing. There is often a power imbalance due to financing and political clout – and it is up to the leaders in philanthropy to foster a collegial environment of information-sharing and appreciation for what other parties bring to the table.\xa0Ayla specifically references the high number of Syrian refugees who have arrived in Turkey and how that has impacted philanthropic and NGO operations on the ground; and the relationships between international organisations, government and local NGOs.\xa0International organisations not only need to take time to identify good local delivery partners on the ground but they also need to have good intentions to share control with these local partners – something that doesn’t always happen. Sharing control with local partners makes operational sense and, also, can help build valuable political capital.\xa0Relations between international organisations and local stakeholders in Turkey have not been optimal, particularly around communications, sharing control and exchanging information.\xa0This comes at a cost both to international organisations and local NGOs alike. Some international organisations have not been able to to complete registrations to continue operations in the country; and many local NGOs could have benefited from credible international supporters who could have helped local stakeholders improve their advocacy – there could have been much better integration of projects.\xa0Ayla observes that risk tolerance becomes low when dealing with politically volatile situations -- the civil space has gotten smaller in the country.\xa0This has had a direct impact on her operations, which they have been able manage by adapting, thinking creatively and moving outside their comfort zone. For example, they have started seeking partnerships with municipalities and local NGOs; as opposed to their traditional central government relationships. They have also started to explore collaboration with local, loosely formed initiatives. \xa0In other words, these challenges also brought opportunities for them and there is a bright side to how they’ve managed these developments.\xa0\xa0However, not all organisations have had such a positive outcome. Ayla notes that there are many organisations that have been shut down in Turkey.\xa0Ayla looks at the context with optimism, highlighting that this fragile situation can also be an opportunity for creativity and for doing things in a different way and, indeed, for appreciating the smaller wins one has.\xa0Ultimately, if what you’re offering meets the needs of your constituents and communities, then you’ll get somewhere. In the case of Ayla’s work, what they offer in terms of education, training and childcare all resonates with people. Their organisation is apolitical and they focus on meeting local needs – adaptability is key.\xa0When asked whether it helps to be a Turkish organisation when operating in Turkey, she was unequivocal: yes, of course it helps.\xa0 Working in Turkey as a foreign organisation can be very difficult. She laments that there aren’t many foreign organisations in Turkey since there is much that international organisations and local NGOs can learn from each other.\xa0Ayla’s key takeaway: have perseverance as you pursue what you believe in. Change rarely happens overnight. If you believe in it, just keep going. Don’t give up, change does eventually happen.\xa0Visit Lidji.org for episode notes, guest bios and useful links.

Pritzker Family Foundation, Janet Froetscher, joins Alberto Lidji to discuss investing $1 Billion to achieve dramatic change; and why no one is interested in marginal change.\xa0The J.B. & M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation was founded by J.B. Pritzker, who’s the current Governor of the State of Illinois, and his wife M.K.\xa0The Foundation aims to invest $1 billion in the coming years to improve the realities in three key thematic areas. They have clear and highly ambitious goals for each one:\xa0(1) Pritzker Children’s Initiative focuses on prenatal to age 3. The goal: in the next 5 years a million more children will have access to high quality services.\xa0(2) Pritzker Community Health Initiative. The goal: in the next 5 years they’ll reduce the number of uninsured children in the City of Chicago by half; and will reduce unintended teen pregnancies by half in the next 5 years.\xa0(3) Human and Civil Rights. The goal: in the next 7 years they aim to reduce the number of women in prison in the State of Illinois by half.\xa0The Foundation is unequivocal in its pursuit of big, audacious goals. They aim to be catalytic and create long-lasting, dramatic change. They aim to partner up with others pretty much in everything they do, at national, state and local level, and across all of their thematic areas of focus.\xa0When asked what advice she has for potential philanthropists who may be tempted to get involved but aren’t quite sure exactly how to go about it, Janet draws parallels between private business and philanthropy. Just like in business, you need to back opportunities where you have confidence in an organisation's CEO and believe in the organisation's strategy and expected returns.\xa0This isn’t surprising considering Janet has an MBA from Northwestern and initially worked in the private sector before moving into the non-profit world. \xa0She always knew she wanted to get into the non-profit world but, at the time of completing her MBA, she was advised to get into the business world first and, only then, explore the non-profit space.\xa0Prior to joining the Foundation, Janet was the CEO of the Special Olympics International.\xa0 Running a foundation is very different than running a global NGO. The Special Olympics is active in 170 countries and as CEO you need buy-in from around the world.\xa0She has a lot more freedom now, especially on the resource deployment side. The Foundation is very nimble and they can deploy resources quickly, as soon as an interesting opportunity is identified. Consequently, they’re usually the first funder to go in, and they’re the ones who usually entice new partners on board.\xa0The beauty of philanthropy is that you can be catalytic – making a dramatic and concrete impact and achieving tangible, sustained change in a big way.\xa0 Recently, they’ve created the Child & Family Research Partnership at the University of Texas -- a centre that links research, policy and programs.\xa0Janet’s key takeaway for listeners: \xa0Think big. No one is interested in marginal change, frankly. \xa0Investors aren’t; donors aren’t; government isn’t. Marginal change with the types of problems we’re dealing with will get us nowhere. There will always be excuses about why we can’t do it that big, and why it can’t happen that fast. And, you just cant’ accept that. \xa0I don’t want to know why it can’t be done; I have no interest in knowing why it can’t be done; I can list for you why it can’t be done. Instead, I want to know how it can be done. The conversation I want to have is about dramatic change. How can we do it.\xa0Visit Lidji.org for full episode notes, guest bios and additional resources.

Jessie explains the dynamics involved in parallel funding and, also, in setting up a unified investment vehicle backed by all collaborative members.\xa0\xa0Ultimately, irrespective of whether they’re deploying funds via parallel funding or as a unified fund, they tend to agree on a single reporting requirement, which simplifies things for the grant recipient.\xa0The Fund does not accept unsolicited funding applications and for the most part they’re investing in major systems change and long-term sustainability of effective programs. They have a team of experts who identify great opportunities to improve the lives of children -- team members\xa0approach\xa0early childhood development from different vantage points based on their diverse experience in the field.\xa0Jessie explains that “when Warren gave his three children funds to start their foundations, he wrote a letter and gave them advice.\xa0\xa0And, one piece of advice was ‘take risk’, invest in things that nobody else will invest in […] because it’s when you take risk that you learn what works and what doesn’t work.” Jessie goes on to say: “I love having that direction provided for us”.\xa0Jessie’s key takeaway for listeners: Do your homework. Don’t assume you have the answers. Do your homework and know what’s going on right now. She also encourages listeners to take the time to think about doing things in partnership with other funders because that's where you’re going to have the greatest impact.\xa0\xa0\xa0Full episode notes, guest bios and links are available at Lidji.org \xa0- \xa0Please subscribe to the podcast if you enjoy it. Thank you! | British Ambassador Designate to South Sudan, Chris Trott, joins Alberto Lidji to discuss conflict resolution, power sharing agreements, Ebola and working in the frontlines.\xa0Chris talks about his career trajectory and the rewarding challenges of being posted to South Sudan, Afghanistan and other precarious settings. He explains why this is important to him and provides advice to others who may be drawn to similar postings while having to juggle family commitments.\xa0\xa0Chris is motivated by wanting to make a difference in a conflict environment.\xa0He is quick to note that despite the challenges of being posted to South Sudan, these pale in comparison with the hardships the South Sudanese population has to endure.\xa0Chris sheds light on the state of affairs in South Sudan and the region. He provides statistics on the death toll from the conflict, along with staggering numbers pertaining to refugees\xa0and internally displaced persons (IDPs).\xa0\xa0He then proceeds to discuss the challenges of securing – and maintaining – power sharing agreements and the difficulties of bringing enemies to the negotiating table.\xa0Chris notes that the statistics around the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in South Sudan are horrifying. He talks of girls’ education and explains how a girl in South Sudan is more likely to die in child birth than complete secondary school.\xa0\xa0\xa0The country has one of the highest maternal and child mortality rates in the world.\xa0\xa0This is but one element of the myriad of problems facing the country, from high rates of sexual violence in conflict to lack of adequate healthcare, malnutrition, the threat of Ebola and more.\xa0Chris notes that “it’s really, really important that we focus on the Sustainable Development Goals, because they are a long way from achieving them here”.\xa0\xa0Chris’ key takeaway: The international community has a hugely important and supportive role in trying to help address crises around the world – we need to find ways to offer that support in a way that empowers local partners, local governments and other key stakeholders.\xa0Full episode notes, guest bios and useful links are available at Lidji.org \xa0- \xa0Please subscribe to the podcast if you enjoy it. Thank you! | Founding Executive Director of the Center for High Impact Philanthropy, Kat Rosqueta, joins Alberto Lidji to discuss social impact, strengthening democracy through philanthropy and knowledge sharing in philanthropy.\xa0Kat speaks passionately about the power of philanthropy and notes that high impact philanthropy is not about how much you give but, rather, it’s about how you give.\xa0\xa0She sheds light on her career trajectory and the origins of the Center for High Impact Philanthropy, at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy & Practice.\xa0\xa0Her team at the Center is highly multi-disciplinary, which Kat notes is essential.\xa0\xa0You need the best thinking from diverse actors and disciplines to improve and change the world.\xa0At the Center, they focus on different thematic areas. An interesting – and highly topical – area of research they’re currently pursuing looks at how philanthropy can strengthen democracy.\xa0At the Center, they decide which thematic areas to focus on by determining whether there’s a high potential for social impact; whether they have the funding; whether they think they can quickly assemble a team that can generate answers quickly and well; and whether there is clear funder interest globally for such research.\xa0\xa0She adds that it’s essential to have clarity of thought on what, exactly, is the social impact goal you’re trying to achieve; ensuring decisions are informed by the best available evidence out there (both academic and practical); embracing an attitude of learning, measuring and managing progress; and ensuring there is value for money.\xa0The Center is keen to provide guidance on philanthropy to a wide audience and to ensure research can be accessed freely, across diverse platforms. They publish the ‘High Impact Giving Guide’, which provides tips, examples and useful resources for donors.\xa0Moreover, the Center has partnerships with the likes of Fidelity Charitable – the largest Donor Advised Fund (DAF) – who\xa0mirror some of the Center’s guidance on giving, and also with Giving Compass, who add some of the Center’s guidance content on their own website.\xa0\xa0Kat is clear that one can be a philanthropist without having to be a high-net-worth individual (HNWI). She lightheartedly distinguishes between ‘high input’ philanthropy where you do need a lot of money and ‘high impact’ philanthropy where it’s not about how much you give but, rather, how you give.\xa0Kat also introduces the concept of a ‘social impact portfolio’, which is a useful way for individuals to balance out how much they may want to give philanthropically, or allocate towards impact investing or, indeed, spend by making sustainable purchasing decisions through conscious consumerism.\xa0The conversation then moves into a policy exploration on philanthropy itself; its accountability (or lack thereof); its freedom to take on risk; its track record and ability to tackle social issues where for some reason neither government nor the business sector have mobilised.\xa0An interesting point to keep in mind is that the pools of philanthropic funds available globally are still relatively small – despite all the media coverage on the topic. Kat notes that even the Gates Foundation’s endowment – the largest foundation out there – wouldn’t be able to pay for two years’ worth of public education in even one state alone, in the USA.\xa0\xa0Kat’s key takeaway for listeners: now, more than ever, any individual can practice high impact philanthropy. High impact philanthropy is not about how much you give but, rather, it’s about how you give. If you’re unsure of where to start your philanthropic journey, you should simply just start and take the first step. Use the wealth of resources available at the Center and elsewhere that are publicly available and get excited about the impact you can make over a lifetime.\xa0Full episode notes, guest bios and useful links are available at Lidji.org \xa0- Please subscribe to the podcast if you enjoy it.

Maria Sirois focuses on the resilience of the human spirit, particularly when under chronic stress, during significant transitions, and/or feeling the shock of wholesale change.\xa0As she describes it in the interview: "My understanding of those who choose to work in the arena of social justice is that they\'re willing to face a kind of chronic overwhelming stress whether you\'re looking at social justice on behalf of the planet and climate change or other species or social justice in terms of humanity in general — those organizations tend to have a chronic steady state of stress with periodic peaks of acute crisis... [my work is about] how do we do well in the worst moments... what does thriving look like? And who might we be at our best?"Maria brings a depth of experience in personal and leadership development for corporate and non‐profit professionals, as well as community members, parents, and those who serve in the health and wellness arenas.\xa0In this episode, Maria focuses on three positive psychology and organizational tools:\xa0\xa0- Establishing a gratitude practice. Expressing gratitude at work not only is a good thing to do but also benefits individuals and organizations in specific and surprising ways.\xa0- Appreciative inquiry. Instead of asking what\'s going wrong how did we fail who\'s responsible for it, organizations using an appreciative inquiry approach are “inquiring toward the good”: what is going right and how do we have good things happen more often?\xa0\xa0- Identifying and leading from personal and organizational strengths. Rather than “fixing” what’s wrong with yourself or your organization, why not put more attention into what you already do well? Recognizing and using your strengths is a more efficient and effective fan fixing what is wrong.Resources mentioned in this episode:VIA Character Strengths\xa0https://www.viacharacter.org/David Cooperider, Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Universityhttps://www.davidcooperrider.com/Sonjia Lyubomirsky, University University of California, Riverside http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/Robert Emmons, Greater Good Science Center, University of Californiahttps://greatergood.berkeley.edu/profile/robert_emmonsBarbara Fredrickson at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill https://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/barb-fredrickson/Maria Sirois, VP of Curriculum, Whole Being Institute\xa0https://wholebeinginstitute.com/maria-sirois/ | Shirronda Almeida grew up in affordable housing, Georgetowne Homes, in Boston, during the period of “white flight” and “urban renewal.” She experienced busing, the moving of the orange line, witnessed the tensions of segregated neighborhoods, and the severe disinvestment in communities of color. What is now Government Center and Copley Square Mall were both taken in the name of urban renewal, tearing down, for example, the West End, which was a vibrant low-income community. Almeida first learned of an alternative model — non-profit community development — more than a decade later.Shirronda is now the director of the Mel King Institute, named after one of the pioneers in Boston’s community development movement. In 1968, he helped organize “tent city”, where Boston residents literally camped on the land that the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) had razed for redevelopment in an area of land adjacent to the future Copley Place Mall. The BRA had claimed that former residents would get first dibs on properties where they had been living. The BRA did not fulfill that promise. Eventually, tent city organizing led to 269 units of mixed-use housing, and the creation of the Tent City Corporation, a nonprofit community-controlled development organization “dedicated to the preservation of decent, affordable housing and a multi-racial, multi-ethnic community of low and moderate-income people in the South End."\xa0The Mel King Institute is now a key training institution for developing leadership and community building skills for staff, board members and resident leaders at community development corporations. The Institute also engages local nonprofits, intermediaries, municipalities and other entities throughout Massachusetts through its programming. Boston has become a national model, noted for having a strong community development ecosystem.In this episode Shirronda talks about:\xa0- How “breaking bread” together is a cornerstone of how the Mel King Institute seeks to create community through building relationships, not just building brick and mortar structures.\xa0\xa0- Her own experience growing up in affordable housing in Boston and how that influenced her decision to engage in nonprofit development work.\xa0- How meditation, yoga, and healing practices have helped her and her peers create a sense of balance in her life and inner work.Links to resources\xa0Mel King InstituteBuddhas Brain, Dr. Rick HansonWhite Fragility, Robin DaingeloReimagining Equality, Anita Hill | When Maria Elena Letona began her tenure as executive director at Centro Presente, she was confident her academic training had well prepared her for the job.

Now, seven years later, Tanaka shares his journey as executive director of the Boston Workers Alliance, describing:\xa0- The lessons imparted by his mentors to build deep trust and engagement in the community.\xa0- The progression of his organization from a handful of people flyering to a force that fought and won groundbreaking reforms to the broken CORI (Criminal Offender Record Information) system.\xa0- The dicey moments when the theory of being accountable to members and board appeared to clash with the reality of running a nonprofit organization.Other resources from Aaron Tanaka:Aaron Tanaka: Creating a just, regenerative and democratic society:https://www.lifteconomy.com/blog/2019/3/12/next-economy-nowSolidarity Philanthropy: Reparations, Democracy & Power:\xa0https://medium.com/justice-funders/solidarity-philanthropy-reparations-democracy-power-9961ef2e1b64Boston Ujima Project:https://ujimaboston.comSolidarity Economy Initiative:https://www.solidaritymass.com/New Economy Coalition:https://neweconomy.net/ | Is it healthy for an organization to have leadership centralized in one person — the executive director?

The stark reality is many associations have critical business issues before them and two of the most significant questions you should be asking: “Is our association (and its revenue model) sustainable?” and, “Are we still relevant in the eyes of our members?” He warns that members are assessing their affiliation with you on an annual basis. Listen in. | Host JP Moery sees a fantastic membership recruitment opportunity for associations who put some rigor behind their state advocacy efforts – and, things are moving fast. Corporations are intensely interested in what’s happening at the state level – whether it’s regulatory or legislative. One of the challenges for many associations is the ability to recruit large companies like these that are really focused on the risks that they are facing here. But, do you have a state advocacy infrastructure in place to best serve these prospective members? | Over the last few months, Host JP Moery has been participating in meetings with clients and their staff plotting out plans for the future, and he’s got a few observations about your membership. He believes association members are looking for an organization that is more member-centric and they have a real good of what they expect out of your value proposition. The actual challenge he sees for associations is letting go of the legacy mentality. What’s holding your association back from moving forward? | What better way to recruit new members than at a live association event? Host JP Moery believes it’s one of the most obvious strategies for membership growth – but most associations don’t take full advantage of this opportunity. This week, JP talks about how the key to success is tactical preparation on several fronts. Here’s the winning process. | This week is a special edition of the show as Host JP Moery welcomes his wife and Moery COO, Diane Moery to discuss strategies the Big Red “M” has developed to demonstrate client return on investment (ROI) and how this approach can easily be adopted by associations who wish to develop and create and ROI document for their membership. Listen in as this power duo breaks down the process. | There are a few things keeping association leaders up at night and one is declining membership numbers with the retirement of Baby Boomers. Host JP Moery knows this is a reality for most organizations. And, data show in the next decade there will be more Millennials in the workforce than any other generation. So, the question is, “How will our organizations adapt to meet the expectations of this demographic?“ Listen in on the latest edition of Association Hustle. | Following a highly successful joint presentation on podcasting – Host JP Moery received some great feedback from conference attendees. However, there was one subtle comment that exemplified for JP a big disconnect between the association and vendor communities. Check out his latest episode to find out more. | This is a fantastic episode if your organization is looking to add some rigor to your communications strategy. Host JP Moery welcomes to the show Ian Alphin and Patrick Mersinger from InLoop, an AI-powered content curator and publisher for associations.\xa0As users of the InLoop system, the Big Red “M” can attest to the value of this technology, which has enabled us to create an industry-wide news hub. Ian and Patrick do a deep dive on how InLoop can greatly improve member engagement by upping your communications game. | Looking to make the next move in your executive career? This week Host JP Moery welcomes to the podcast his long-time friend and government relations search specialist, Ivan Adler, Principal of Ivan Adler Associates. Ivan, aka – the Lobbyist Hunter – brings his decades of experience in the search business to the show on what associations are really looking for in their next CEO. It’s a whole new all game, folks – do you have what it takes? | During this milestone 200th episode, the tables are turned.

She remembers tension, addiction, financial pressure, and marital struggle that only worsened as she grew up. Amanda grew used to carrying this secret: that her family wasn't as intact as they appeared. It got harder, though, once her dad became abusive and her parents divorced.Years later, now a wife and mom, Amanda is pulling her family's experience from the shadows with the belief that her story isn't shameful, but rather a way to show others that hope and healing are possible. | Bonnie’s home was safe in the literal sense of the word. She had a roof over her head, food to eat everyday, and parents who cared about her.But she felt smothered. She was lacking something important: a sense of belonging, and a sense that her feelings mattered. So she found friends who accepted her for who she was, but they also introduced her to a variety of other things that put her in harm’s way. Everything Bonnie experienced, though, helped her far more than she could have imagined at the time. Until now, many of our stories have had a clear before and after, a clear first story and second story. Bonnie’s story is different, and because of this she teaches us grace, strength, and learning from your past even when things feel darkest. | This is part one of a two-part series from Johnny and his daughter, Merrill.When Merrill was 14 she started acting out. She wasn’t sure why, she just knew whatever she was doing made her feel better for a moment. The drinking, the drugs, the partying, all of it was covering up a darkness she was trying to shove away. Then a few years later she decided she’d had enough. She realized it wasn’t working. The darkness was still there. She reached out to someone she knew would keep her safe, her dad, and he knew exactly how to help. Merrill’s story feels familiar in context of the things we’re reading in the news and seeing on TV, but when we hear it like a story, from someone who feels like they’re sitting right beside us, it feels unique and personal in some very important ways. | This is part one of a two-part series from Johnny and his daughter, Merrill. Johnny visited Second Story’s teen shelter as a young person when he felt he had nowhere to go. It made a profound impact in his life then, but maybe even more so decades later when his daughter was struggling like he was. He remembered his experience and knew exactly where to take her -- back to the place that made him feel safest when he felt most vulnerable. There’s a moment of striking clarity in this story: a moment where a father says to his daughter, “You need help. We need help. And I know exactly where to find it.” | Growing up Carla loved bugs and books. “I was a dorky kid,” she remembers. She got teased a little bit, but she hardly cared as long as she was learning and reading. Then she got older and found herself in groups of people who disrespected her, even took advantage of her. Her mom tried to commit suicide. She started drinking. She got into an abusive relationship. She was coerced into having an abortion. The day Carla’s family found out she was pregnant with her son was a day that changed her life. “I didn’t even have any shoes on my feet -- I just ran.” Ran away from an abusive family, away from a life marked by alcohol and dangerous relationships, and also away from all the comfortable things she once knew. It was the best decision she could have made. | Manny and Chauncy are brothers, with stories reflecting each others’ in many ways. Both Liberian, both called Northern Virginia home for a time, and both with dreams that inspire them and keep them up at night. Chauncy had something unique, though: someone telling him he could do it. Someone reminding him that his dreams had value. Someone telling him to never give up. And this person changed everything for him. | Simron is a first generation immigrant, originally from South Asia. When she and her family moved to the U.S. she realized her new home had different expectations -- and opportunities -- for her than anything she’d ever known. Her family, though, didn’t see things the same way. Simron wanted to go to college and pursue her dreams, while her family wanted to arrange the sort of marriage that Simron had seen lead to abuse and injustice. So she made a choice. She said, “This cycle of oppression will continue, the cycle of being helpless. And that’s when I thought, ‘I don’t want a daughter who will go through what I’m going through…’ I thought, ‘If I can’t have what I want I won’t accept what’s given to me, either. I’ll fight.’” And fight she did. | For the most part, Tina Gordon thought she was a lot like any other kid. She went to school. She had siblings at home. She played outside. Sometimes, though, she sensed that things were...off. She didn’t always get dinner, for example, and her friends' families treated each other differently than hers' did. Then when she was seven years old, Tina and her siblings were removed from their home and placed in Child Protective Services. This is Tina’s story of being a foster child and later being adopted, dealing with rejection, and loving her biological mom even when she wasn’t the parent she should have been. | Everyone dreams about how they want their life to look, but not everyone has the same level of opportunity to fulfill these dreams. Some of us grow up in loving families with solid support systems, while some of us are born into hardship and trauma. None of us can choose the life we’re born into; none of us can write our own first story. These situations might place us at a disadvantage, but they do not doom us. And sometimes a person or an experience helps bring the future we dreamed of into reach. It lets us pick up the pen and write our own second story. This podcast is dedicated to telling these stories -- stories of people who were born into unimaginable circumstances and were able to rewrite the narrative of their own life.

Click here to start simplifying your digital fundraising.Hello fellow Simplifiers! This little rabbit hole of anxiety is the place where many fundraisers freeze. Who has experienced this? You know the supporter is right for the organization and they have the means for the support. When you run them down the list of qualifying measures for a larger gift, a gift you get by sitting across from them and asking, perhaps even putting a figure in front of them, oh boy, wow. My palms just got sweaty.This week\'s episode is brought to you by You Got This Coaching. Head over to our website and Facebook page to join in on the conversation.Make it go away, make the asking anxiety leave and never come back. Well, that probably won’t happen, but we can make the asking anxiety become a part of the process and it will settle down. Here is the system for asking, yes, the simplifying system is how we will beat back this ugly anxiety monster.\xa0Simplify your fundraising success! The podcast today is sponsored by You Got This Coaching at dawngabel.com. Simple solutions to your complicated world of nonprofit fundraising.\xa0Plan VisitFirst, let’s plan the visit. When would you like to meet your donor? You have not asked her to visit with you yet, so this is your visual. When? Morning? Are you at your best in the morning, afternoon, or evening? There is probably a 50/50 chance she will ask what works best for you, so decide ahead. Don’t dither if she offers or asks what works best for you. Know what time works for you, both emotionally and on your calendar. Where, where do you see this conversation with her? I love visiting with donors in the most comfortable environment for them. Where do you feel their comfort? But, if that is a place of discomfort for you, then keep that in mind. An example here is if you are very uncomfortable in their country club environment, but they love being there. Simplify, don’t make yourself uncomfortable. I will add something here that if you find yourself feeling this way about the country club environment, find ways to make yourself more familiar with that environment. Have lunch with a co-worker there, play a round of golf or tennis there. But today, we have a goal of asking our donor if she would like to up her support. Your country club anxiety is a project to fix another day. So, you have written down two spots that are comfortable for her and for you that would work for your visit. Perhaps that is the coffee shop next to your office and then your donor’s home.Call and make the appointment.\xa0Buddy UpBring a friend, if you have another donor, board member, volunteer, etc. who knows the\xa0 prospect even better than you, invite them. If you are new at this, having a partner is a great way of helping yourself create a system that works for you. Even if you do not have a person who is close to them, that is okay, bring someone who works with the impact they appreciate the most. But, you need to have them plan with you. You must follow a couple of simple rules to make this an effective meeting.\xa0Make an agenda. No, not exactyl like a board meeting but sort of. If you create an agenda and work it out on paper, then you will follow that in your head. Make it 3 bullet points. Plan who will say what and agree to a signal that makes the other person keep on topic and another signal for them to shut up and listen. Practice these signals so you will recognize them in the meeting.\xa0Happy Happy Joy JoyBring your smile and peppy energy! Coffee? Tea? Energy drink? Exercise for endorphin release? Bring your positive game! Positive energy brings back positive energy. Nod your head yes, up and down; no negative shaking your head side to side. Practice letting your fear and anxiety go. The donor will feel your anxiety and might even unconsciously worry that the donation is in good hands. Look at photos of the people who have been impacted and note how they make you feel. This is why you do what you do. Picture them before you walk in the door and remember that feeling, that is bio feedback and it is a great tool to get over fear and anxiety.\xa0Words MatterLet’s talk. You are not asking for money, you are offering them an opportunity to make a large impact. The opportunity that will help them reach the goal of making the difference they want to see in the world. Their work so far has brought about wonderful change. Talk a bit about that. Let your partner mention the previous program success that their partnership helped to bring about.\xa0 Use the word “You” and “Your” NOT the words “Our” or “We.” Her impact is where she is focused. I don’t care if she is a $50 dollar a month donor. Her $600 dollars did what? Let her share in that glory moment with you. But here is your transition, “There is an opportunity to do ________”\xa0Future FantasyThe next step is into the future. “Wouldn’t it be amazing if there was __________?”Rev your engine for what the finish line of the project would look like. Let them know how you see the future. Paint a picture of the completion, that is why when there is a building campaign, we have artist’s renderings. Create a story of your project in the paint of words. Create a rendering of the impact the donor will have. “Wouldn’t it be amazing if there was ________?”\xa0Shared JourneyThis is a shared journey. The donor is with you on the path and they even have their own version of the journey. You and the organization are just a conduit for their journey. Like a car, you get them from point A to point B, but where do they want to go? I hope you and they are on the same page for the journey to the impact you both want. That is part of a feasibility study. Now, I am not a huge proponent of external feasibility studies. That is the topic of another podcast, but one of the outcomes of a study can be that you are not ready due to the fact you are not on the same page with your prospective major donors. You should know your prospect well enough that they are on the same road you are on with your individual journeys.\xa0 Help them find their way by having a conversation with them not just informing them. I know, I just told you to tell them a story of what the future could look like. But stop, let them speak, ask them what do they think about that future? I think we can all practice shutting up. When we are communicating, we fill the air with sound. If you are quiet, they will fill the air with sound. Let them. They may at this point, tell you they don’t see what you see for the future. I have been shocked at what donors have said to me during silence. They will voice their concerns that you are not on the right track. That is okay, let them talk. I have heard them tell me that I should dream bigger, fair enough! I have heard them tell me they are ready to give, hallelujah!This week\'s episode is brought to you by You Got This Coaching. Head over to our website and Facebook page to join in on the conversation.Listen and LearnThis is a continuance of the dialogue. Listen more than half of the time. Listen, listen, listen. Ask follow up questions to their concerns. Listen.\xa0Ask...Now…“Would you support this impact at $___?”Let them answer. Be quiet.If they say that they aren’t ready to give, ask, “What would bring you to that level of support for the program?”Let them answer. Be quiet.When they tell you what would bring them in, ask for the follow up. May I contact you when that happens? May I come back for a visit in June? May I call when we reach that milestone? Whatever fits their response.\xa0Here is a wonderful example of a visit. I and a co-worker made an appointment to speak to a banker about his bank’s foundation. He was a personal supporter of the organization and we were interested in a grant for a piece of equipment. We spoke of his personal impact support and why he was passionate about the organization. He spoke, mostly, and he asked about a program from the past. The other person who was with me knew a bit more than I did about the older program that was no longer operating and she shared about that.\xa0 He told us about a person who he had great affection for who was highly involved in the program. My partner happened to remember the individual, barely, but mentioned her recollection. Well, he let us know that he was the trustee of her personal foundation. It was dedicated but there were funds at the end of every year that were not dedicated and he had discretion on those dollars. Although we did not drop the topic of the bank’s larger foundation, he did let us know we were welcome to apply and he would give a recommendation with it. But, there was a lot of competition for the funds in that pool. He was so excited about the connection of the foundation he had governance over that he brought out his file on the lady and showed us new clippings and other memorabilia that shared the person he obviously loved. He repeated that he felt he would like to extend her interest in the organization that she had in her life with her trust he governed. We were bowled over and asked for a follow up.\xa0 He suggested three months out and he would know more about how the investments would produce and what he would be able to contribute.\xa0Three months later, I followed up. I had built a better relationship with him and so we had some things to chat about other than money. He wanted to know how the funds for the project, approximately 170 thousand, were going. I let him know of the three pledges we had received. He was very happy and excited. He wanted to know the lifespan of the equipment, I had that information for him, and I spoke of the impact the equipment was expected to give. He was excited and let me know he expected to donate from the foundation. I made the ask, since I felt from my research that this was around the amount of leftover money he was likely to have, perhaps even a little higher than he would have. Over asking is better than under asking. I asked him for $5,000.\xa0 My research was wrong, he responded he felt that he could do better than that, considerably better, with a little smile.\xa0 He would not share the amount, I tried, and he told me he would not know the exact amount until the end of October. I asked to stop by at that time, he said he would count on it. I sent him a thank you note after each visit and I also sent him an old photo I had found of the foundation’s creator when she worked on the other project. He was delighted and sent a hand written thank you for the photo. (don’t forget to keep building the relationship.) It was a beautiful day when he surprised us with a check in October for 15 thousand dollars.\xa0\xa0I will go over the steps quickly, pick the person based on their involvement; plan the visit; bring a friend; make an agenda; bring your joy; words matter; paint the future; it’s their journey, listen, and then ask.\xa0 Remember, they love the impact already or you would not have picked them and above all, you got this!This week\'s episode is brought to you by You Got This Coaching. Head over to our website and Facebook page to join in on the conversation. | It is so easy to say and yet so easy to forget to do and then feel like it was just a nice thing...not an important thing. A Thank You is SO important that it may be the difference between making your budget of donations and not making it in 2019.

A question this week brings me to the topic of thank yous. I was asked if I had one thing to suggest for increasing donations in the last quarter of this year, what would it be? That is easy and even if you are doing it well, you can do it better and still increase your donations, and that is thanking the donors. I have had many nonprofits swear to me they thank their donors and I can usually bet they are considering their tax receipt of donation as their thank you. The research is in on that one, donors perceive the receipt as just that, a receipt and they put it in their tax information. Emotionally and practically, they place the letter acknowledging their gift away for their accountant.\xa0I have never seen a tax receipt sitting on the ledge of a donor’s window, but I have seen a handwritten thank you note saved and cherished.\xa0 That is all well and good, but what about hard facts.first-time donors who get a personal thank you within 48 hours are 4x more likely to give a second gift. (McConkey-Johnston International UK)a thank-you call from a board member\xa0to a newly acquired donor within 24 hours of receiving the gifts will increase their next gift by 39%. (Penelope Burk)in a databasewhere the average number of gifts made by donors is three, a thank-you letter reaffirming the difference that their donations made increased average gifts by 60% without reducing response rate in comparison to a control group of donors who did not receive this thank-you communication. (Jen Shang)\xa0Let’s take those apart a bit. A first-time donor who gets a personal thank you, not the receipt, within 48 hours are 4 times as likely to give a second gift. That is crazy huge when you consider that the likely hood of a second gift is only 22%, so even if they are half right, that is a large increase for donors. Don’t be skimpy on the thank you, call out their first- time donor status and welcome them into the ‘family’. Seth Godin in Tribes: We Need You To Lead Us said, “A group needs only two things to be a tribe: a shared interest and a way to communicate.” Your donor has an interest in the good work you do, we will call it impact. That impact is important to the donor. So important, they gave you money! That is easy to forget sometimes, that the donor believes in the same thing you believe it at an extremely high level, they gave you cash. Now, they must be enticed to be a part of the tribe, your tribe. Give them a means of communication. Thank them.\xa0Thank yous simplify your fundraising success!

Whoa, they will give an extra .39 cents on the dollar more on average because we bothered to have a similar person in the tribe, a board member who is not only a leader, but a fellow donor, give them a phone call? Astounding! I hear from board members frequently, what can I do to help? Well, there you are! You as a board member can volunteer to call 10 first-time donors a month. You don’t have to ask for money to be a money making machine for the organization! I know this is true because I have seen it myself in action. When a board member does even less than this, if a board member calls donors at Thanksgiving or Valentine’s day as part of a thank-a-thon, the reaction is life affirming for both the donor and and the board member. I have had board members call to ask for more names because it made their week to speak to people who were so glad to have a call of thank you from a fellow tribe member.\xa0To expand on Seth Godin’s pathway of communication, we only have to look at the means of which we are increasing their opportunity to belong and supporting the tribe. A personal hand-written thank you gives the receiver the permission to write back because it is personal. I took the time to write you so you are allowed to take the time to write me. The formal letter is a barrier of formality. It stops the perceived possibility of return. A phone call is a step further, a literal opportunity to communicate back along the pathway. But it is even more interesting than that, if you leave a voicemail, the outcome is the same as a call that was picked up. I believe it is the same reason as the handwritten thank you note, there is a permission to respond even if they do not take you up on the permission. They are given a pathway to communicate to the tribe.\xa0Don’t stop there!Now hit them with what they really want, full membership in the communication pathway. Jen Shang’s research says that in a database\xa0where the average number of gifts made by donors is three, a thank-you letter reaffirming the difference that their donations made increased average gifts by 60% without reducing response rate in comparison to a control group of donors who did not receive this thank-you communication.\xa0This is a follow up thank you. A personal letter, it can be typed, with specific information about what their donation did, maybe that was feed ten homeless families or perhaps that sent three inner city youth to camp, whatever it was let them know. Tell a specific story about one of the recipients. If they sent a youth to leadership camp, get permission to interview that youth. A photo would be great. Get a real story about how it affected their lives to be given the gift. Include a personal note of thanks from the young person. It doesn’t really matter your impact, you will be able to link the donor to the impact in a follow up thank you letter. The letter should make them the hero. Make sure they are thanked for being the right person to do this very special thing. It is called being donor centered. Are you centered on the donor or are you centered on your nonprofit? Do not say XYZ nonprofit sent three youth to camp with your donation.\xa0 Do say, You, donor, sent Amelia to the experience of her lifetime!\xa0What a gift to know where your donation made a difference. I worked for the American Red Cross Blood Services and although we thanked donors and let them know great stories of people who were helped by their donation, Sweden’s blood services are taking it to the next level with this process in mind.Blood donation rates are in decline all over the developed world, so Sweden decided to up their texting game. Donors are sent an automatic text message telling them when their blood has been used. People who donate initially receive a thank you text. You may get that in America also, but the Swedes get a text when it makes it into someone else’s veins. Now that is some thoughtful tracking that allows the donor to receive the communication pathway. Their donation was not just to the greater good but to a real person who had a medical emergency and I know when my donation mattered. Gives me chills.\xa0What can you do to bring that communication pathway to your donor. One way on the highest levels, is to increase your personal contact with your major donors. Another way is to create the system of emails and letters that go out to every first-time donor. Do you have a drip campaign for emails to FTDs? What if you put into your donor management software a prompt to send the receipt, a hand-written note, and assign a board member to call the FTD? And, you had a programmed series of three emails that follow up with a prompt of in 90 days to send another letter of follow up that details the use of their donation? Too much? No, way.\xa0There you are, one thing that will increase\xa0 your donations this year. Simplify the process, but remember, simplifying the process does not mean there won’t be work. The bulk of the work is in the programming and planning and implementing the system. When you have control of your system, your stress level will go down. Evidence based fundraising and the technology to track and communicate with your donors.\xa0 Never forget, you got this!\xa0For your FREE podcast action sheet, visit my website, www.dawngabel.comBe sure to like me on Facebook for additional fundraising tips. www.facebook.com/yougotthispodThis episode is sponsored by You Got This Coaching.\xa0 | Episode NotesThis episode of You Got This Fundraising is brought to you by www.dawngabel.com.

Email Dawn at Dawn.Gabel@dawngabel.comEpisode TranscriptHave you ever had a friend contact you and strike up a conversation that was out of character and then have them ask you to buy their networking product? Ugh, that is the worst! Now, you are both uncomfortable, but you know she is trying her hardest and so you feel obligated to purchase.\xa0 Stop, that is NOT relationship marketing. But it is what we are talking about today...Or rather, we are talking about Not doing THAT, whatever you call it! Today, Relationship marketing and what it REALLY means on the You Got This Fundraising podcast!\xa0\xa0\xa0Hello fellow Simplifiers! I saw a Facebook post this week that said, and I am paraphrasing, Dear Friends, I Don’t want your health food, weight loss supplements, or any other networked item. Please stop messaging me. My friend explained that he had been contacted by a friend he had not spoken to for over a year. I was interested, so I private messaged him and when I asked if he would mind if I paraphrased him on my podcast, he said he was fine I could even directly quote him and use his name because he felt so strongly about this. I have not, used his name that is, but I get it...Don’t you? Who has not been invited to makeup, jewelry, burping plastic, kitchen ware, workout clothes, and MORE networking sales parties or direct solicitations by family and friends who don’t take the time to know if that is something you want to be joining into?\xa0I have a deeply felt bias of these sort of network/relationship marketing, and I use the terms loosely,\xa0 that goes back to my childhood. When my mother was at her financial lowest after my father had left our family, a distant family member called and asked if we were up to a visit. My mother was excited and went out of her way to be very creative for the company coming. She made a nice soup meal and lovely mint iced tea so our food budget would not be too dented and yet the offerings were tasty. She was so pleased to have someone visit after the trauma of abandonment and divorce that she made us all wear our Sunday clothes and told us not to eat until the guest had made their plate. Imagine my mother’s disappointment that the guest wanted to sell her vitamins! And, although we barely had enough to feed ourselves, my mother politely ordered one bottle of vitamins because she was ashamed to admit she did not have the money.\xa0\xa0 That memory had me shying away from one-on-one fundraising, with anyone I knew, for years, but then I found the secret key to unlock the power of REAL relationship marketing, and that is...interest.\xa0When we have a positive relationship, it is a precious thing. In the best-case situations, we have a ‘know, like, and trust’ bond. My friend probably felt he knew, liked, and trusted the other person, until that person broke that trust and solicited where he had no interest. He was made uncomfortable by the ask. So uncomfortable he went on Facebook to do a blind ‘stop that’ post. How do we have a relationship and not feel like we are damaging the relationship by asking for a donation? Well, it boils down to the donor’s journey. Even with for-profit network marketing, if the individual is not on the journey with the sales person, then we are breaking the trust of the relationship. A clear indication that the person making the ask is relying solely on past relational standing, like my mother buying out of obligation and shorting our survival money. By the way, those vitamins sat on our kitchen table for a long time. They seemed to be her monument to trusting too much and bowing to social pressures. I never saw her buy out of politeness again.\xa0In relationship fundraising, we must be focused on the prospective donor and their interests. Their expression of the need they have feelings for or find a way to elevate their feelings. Is this something they have spoken to you about? Is there a way for you to bring TOGETHER a known interest your prospect has expressed and your project you are wanting to have them involved in? Here is a great example, a philanthropic family was approached to donate to landscaping of an area of town near the local university. The family felt that was a nice project, but did not jump at the suggestion. They politely ate their lunch and left and the meeting the nonprofit had arranged, leaving the executive director with nothing for her efforts.\xa0 The director was confused.\xa0 They were university supporters and they were heavily involved in landscaping projects in the city that her organization had been a part of before. Later, there was an opportunity to landscape another area of town that the nonprofit was also working on. A supporter brought the mother of the family with her to a planning meeting. After the meeting, the matriarch of the family became an interested member of the group. She took a tour of the proposed area, attended a lighting presentation by a commercial lighting company that had vintage commercial street lamps, and she even volunteered to water flower pots that were a temporary placement in the area. You know the end of this story, the family ended up being the major sponsor for the landscaping and streetscaping.\xa0\xa0We care so deeply for our impact that we make the mistake of assuming even those who know, like, and trust us will feel our caring through our words. Don’t get me wrong, that does work, copy writing is all about feeling the caring through the words, but that is a one-time gift. First time gift retention was 22% last year and will probably be less this year. Our words are the beginning of their journey with their impact. Bring your donor to the impact both literally and figuratively. Don’t ask, show and tell. Involve them in your world. Build their interest and deepen their relationship with the impact. Have them enjoy some of the sights, sounds, and smells of the impact. Visiting the proposed landscaped site and seeing the possibility of the future with drawings, a knowledgeable guide, and some potted plants arranged so those interested see the proposed project and join into the vision, brings a donor on the journey with you rather than you telling them about your journey with the impact of the program.\xa0I can hear your mind working from here--see, hear, touch, smell--that is great for a garden but what about the homeless, cancer, hospice? I get it. I have worked in the medical nonprofit world. I know the privacy issues and the sensory issues. But, don’t let the difficult stop your creativity in bringing your donors on a journey with your impact. Bring the donor with you to places they CAN go and don’t dwell on the places they can’t go. Creative tours are not as hard to dream up as you might think if you put your mind to it. I know a children’s hospital that lined surgical beds up in the hall and had those touring pretend they were there to comfort their child as they waited for surgery. They put baby dolls in the beds and had individuals pair up across the child as if they were parents. It illustrated as no other way could the need for more space for family as they waited for a traumatic event in their child’s life, a surgery.\xa0Another organization brought end of life support to prospective donors by inviting them to a Mother’s Day Service for family of hospice patients who had passed during the year. This became an opportunity for the families to share their hospice experience. If you hear the experience that a family member has with hospice, it is less about the death and more about supporting the living. It also gave the prospective donors the opportunity to remember their own mother’s, grandmother’s, and mother figures by putting a memorial flower, provided, into the larger commemorative bouquet.\xa0Taking the donor on their own journey and understanding their interest level, guides your ability to comfortably ask the donor, when the time comes, to financially support the impact. Comfortable for you AND them. Relationship marketing is about the relationship the customer or donor has with the product or impact, not the relationship they have with you! Let me say it again, relationship marketing is defined by the relationship itself. If the relationship is within the product, or in our case the impact, then it is natural that they would receive you and enjoy the process of making the donation. If they are approached for a donation for your organization and your relationship with them is based on your high school senior year, they will be uncomfortable and so will you. They may make a small donation, peer-to-peer, but then never again donate. Well, you say, at least we have $50 we did not have before. True, but you wasted your time that could have been better spent building a donor that would have a life-time value of $5,000 or more. You also made your relationship with that person strained for all future contact. Are you going to call them every time you need money and no other time? Uncomfortable for them and for you.\xa0Simplify your fundraising success! The podcast today is sponsored by You Got This Coaching at www.dawngabel.com. Simple solutions to your complicated world of nonprofit fundraising. Got to www.dawngabel.com and join us on the journey to your success! There you will find the podcast PDF for today. Take time right now to download our Donor Relationship Decision Tree PDF and think of a prospective donor. Put their name at the top of the page. Follow the thought process for the individual. How do you know them? Does another person connected to the organization know them better? Remember the donor who was brought to the garden tour by her friend, who was already a supporter.\xa0Next, what makes you think they would be interested? On a scale of 1 to 10, are they interested in a project you are seeking funding for? Have they been involved before? Are they close to a person who has received impact from your organization? If they are interested at a level of 8, 9, or 10, take time to give them a call for an appointment to speak about the program. Would that call be better made by someone else in the organization? If they are at 5,6, or 7 level of interest, what involvement would bring them closer? If they are a 1, 2, or even 3 level of interest, why are you thinking of them? Just because they are donors of other organizations and have means does not follow they will be a good fit for a call, even if you know them from high school. That is a relationship between them and your impact that you will need to cultivate over a longer timeline than we are talking about, and if you jumped to an ask meeting, they would feel, as my friend did, insulted and upset enough that they just might make a frustrated post on Facebook.\xa0This episode of You Got This Fundraising is brought to you by www.dawngabel.com.

It was so validating.\xa0 I felt valuable!\xa0 And I was excited to find a way to balance work I loved with family time. What flexible work arrangement would help you balance your work and family obligations along with your focus on impact?\xa0 What would you like to do with your current role?\xa0 Set some goals.\xa0 Do your research.\xa0 There are many different options available today and they are far more prevalent now than when I asked for my new arrangement!\xa0 I say all that to say, there is hope! Here are some to consider:  Flexible Schedule: longer hours for less days, changing up your start time to earlier or later so you can get some life or impact activities out of the way before or after work. Work From Home, also sometimes known as telecommuting. You still need to devote the hours but can save those commute minutes towards impact. Job Sharing: with the right partner this flex work option can be amazing for employees and employers. Fill a full time job seamlessly with two people for a wider range of skills and built-in coverage for vacations or other time off. Part Time  If you want to go part time, how will that impact your take home pay?\xa0 Remember, there are variables other than paid hours that you need to consider.\xa0 Will your dry cleaning bill go down?\xa0 What will happen to your transportation costs?  Once you know what you are looking for, start putting together a presentation and formal written proposal (if you think you will need it).  Start by anticipating what the issues will be for your boss.\xa0 Make a list and address each item in writing prior to the meeting.\xa0 Be very specific.\xa0 These items will become your proposal.\xa0 I would not reference having children at home in the proposal.\xa0 You can, however, talk about your desire to balance your rewarding career with your outside responsibilities and pursuits.

No sweat! In this episode, Jeff Ebbing, director of marketing and communications for Southeastern Community College in Iowa, joins Pam Cox-Otto, founder and CEO of Interact Communications, for a discussion on how to make the most of your experience while at conferences.\xa0 | Community colleges are structured to respond to community needs, and in order to meet those needs and train students for good-paying careers in the community, colleges must understand the types of industries in their service areas and how likely those industries and local businesses are to hire their students. In addition to this, we also know local business leaders sit on college advisory and foundation boards, donate to scholarships, and lend their expertise in classrooms. So, building strong relationships with these key stakeholders is absolutely essential to the success of colleges.\xa0In this episode of Interact\'s Community College Marketing MasterClass, Cheryl Broom of Interact and Scott Ashton of the Oceanside Chamber of Commerce discuss ways to better engage with local businesses and build stronger relationships with them.\xa0 | In 2018, Shasta College became one of the emergency shelters during the devastating Carr Fire.

Or better yet, does your boss ever tell you to place ads in a channel you know isn’t working? Well, we have good news... each year since 2007, Interact has conducted a national survey on communication preferences and media consumption habits of community college students. We’ve watched how students’ preferences have evolved with the introduction of new media (and we’ve watched some media die off completely). In this discussion, Dr. Pamela Cox-Otto talks about the most recent academic year’s data results and what media you should be looking at this next year.\xa0 | Did you know that 40% of all community college-intending students fail to enroll after applying?! This phenomena, which is called "summer melt," is well-documented but it doesn\'t have to get you and your college in hot water.

Their journey began in 2012, when they started by talking to lots of people and hosting coffee-mornings to engage their local community and find out what was needed.After starting with a popup space in a café, they looked for a larger “dual purpose” space which they could set up how they liked, and were able to run workshops and events to test and “prove” the business model.The next step was to find a permanent space they could lease. With volunteer support (including David and Joy volunteering their own time) they managed to set up their full-time home which is now owned and run by the community.\xa0David speaks about some of the challenges they’ve faced, including educating people on the difference between coworking and serviced office space, and getting their local council to understand what they were trying to achieve, which didn’t quite match what the council themselves wanted to deliver in the early stages.We also hear about\xa0how their coworking space has been able to deliver what the community has neededthe opportunities it’s created for coworkers to give backthe challenge of coworkers driving to the coworking space and needing parking, versus using public transportattracting coworkers from outside the citythe successes they’ve had in supporting members to get funding to develop what they’re passionate aboutFinally, we also hear from one of their members, Jinhee, about the journey he’s embarked on as a result of finding David and Joy’s coworking space.Links for this episodeCanvas Coworking https://canvascoworking.com.auSee all episodes in iTunes • Overcast | Claire speaks with Charu and Zaid from 91 Springboard in India.

The new data show that confidence increased in Europe and in the Euro Area. Compared to quarter 1, Europeans are more likely to spend on new clothes, vacations, out of home entertainment and medical. But there are also consumers using the spare cash to nourish their savings or retirement funds, not surprising given the demographic profile of the continent. Europeans are less interested in spending on home improvements and decoration and tech products. | In this podcast, The Conference Board’s Chief Economist Bart van Ark and Senior Researcher Denise Dahlhoff discuss select results from the Q2 2019 run of The Conference Board Global Consumer Confidence Survey, which is a collaboration with Nielsen. Findings include developments regarding consumer confidence in countries such as the U.S., China, Brazil, Mexico, UK, France and Germany, consumers’ spending on certain categories, and their top concerns.

The Global Consumer Confidence Index takes the temperature of consumers in 64 markets around the world—including how, what, and where they intend to spend in the months ahead. In this episode, Chief Economist Bart van Ark and Senior Researcher Denise Dahlhoff discuss the background of the index, an overview of key findings for Q1 2019, and how business leaders can best leverage these quarterly numbers going forward.\xa0 | According to the IMF, total debt worldwide—including government, consumer, financial, and non-financial sources—now amounts to $185 trillion, or some 2.25 times the size of global GDP. A generation ago, the ratio stood at just 1:1. But despite this rapid rise in leverage, the traditional dangers of government debt in particular—soaring inflation and interest rates—have yet to materialize. Should the evidence of recent decades force experts to reconsider their basic monetary and fiscal assumptions? Have policymakers and the private sector alike reached a new equilibrium of debt tolerance? Or are the established laws of economic gravity still intact—and ignored at our peril? Chief Economist Bart van Ark surveys the evidence with the help of an expert panel. Indications 2.8 Resources   Window On the World’s Debt (full webcast on-demand)  Window On Latin America (free registration for next webcast on 4/24)  | The Conference Board started the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) in 1967. In February 2009, at the nadir of the financial crisis, the Index reached an all-time low of 25.3 points (1985=100). Over the next decade, an arduous recovery littered with false starts and temporary reversals slowly took root to produce a historic expansion. By October 2018, consumer confidence had climbed to 137.9—just points away from the all-time high reached in 2000. \xa0\xa0 Since then, however, things have become murkier and more volatile. After a 7.3-point drop in March 2019, consumer confidence now stands at 124.1. Consumers’ appraisal of the present situation has taken an especially big hit. Is this an expected moderation or an early warning of impeding recession? Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators and surveys, examines the evidence.  Indications 2.7 Reading List  The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index®  | Around the world, business leaders are growing increasingly nervous about 2019 growth prospects. Are consumers following suit? Ultimately, the answer will come down to job availability, income growth incomes, and the purchasing power of their hard-earned money.

What overall message—if any—did voters, workers, and consumers send by delivering a Democratic "blue wave" in the House and many local races, while strengthening Republicans\' tenuous hold on the Senate? Will President Trump be forced to recalibrate his high-stakes trade policies? Could a bipartisan infrastructure deal really be on track for 2019? And what are the real risks—and unseen opportunity costs—of the intense partisan tribalism seen in the run-up to the election, and hardly abated since?\xa0 Senior Economist Brian Schaitkin reviews the questions answered November 6—and the new ones raised—with help from our expert panel. Indications 2.3 reading list  Window on the US Midterm Elections (webcast)  | Oil broke $70 a barrel for the first time in four years in January and hasn\'t receded since. Most experts predict it\'ll remain between $70 and $85 in the near term. But any sense of stability or consensus is deceiving. A witches\' brew of volatile, complicated, and often countervailing global forces has been the real story of oil prices in 2018—and likely the only safe bet for 2019 as well. Ataman Ozyildirim,\xa0Director and Global Research Chair at The Conference Board, breaks down the factors at play with the help of an expert panel.

In this premiere episode, Bart van Ark, Chief Economist of The Conference Board, breaks down the mysteries of productivity in the 2010s: Above all, why has productivity growth slowed to a crawl—down to 1.4% in 2015 and 2016—in the face of accelerating advances in mobile, automation, big data, and the cloud?\xa0 With the help of experts from the OECD and the McKinsey Global Institute, Bart dives into the latest data—and past technological transformations—to uncover a surprising answer: While economists and policymakers\xa0keep racking their brains to crack the past decade\'s "productivity paradox", a return to an era of faster productivity growth may already be happening, right before our eyes.', 'chan_desc': "A serious conversation on the global economy grounded in the data, insights, and outlooks you need to stay ahead of the curve in business and beyond.

Now you feel stressed, you did have a plan.… at least until the moment you got sidetracked on social media and it all went down the drain. Can you relate to any of this?\xa0 If you can, you’re not alone, so don’t beat yourself up about time lost – just use it better going forward. In today’s episode, we’re talking about how to balance social media at work. I’m going to share with you my best tips on how to take control, and make the most out of the time you spend on social media and avoid wasting time!\xa0 Here are four tips I listed to help you balance social media at work: Plan your posts out ahead of time.\xa0 Keep the topics of your posts on topic – your brand and who you are talking to. Set a timer for 30 minutes to create a post and put it on Facebook and Instagram.\xa0 This mindset will keep you from going down rabbit holes and it creates accountability. Resist the temptation to look at your news feed. Not only is it a waste of time, it takes the wind out of your sails when you start comparing yourself to others! Know when to quit. If you can’t concentrate even when you’re trying hard, don’t try to force it. \xa0 Come back to it later and it will probably be a lot easier to finish and a better product. Everybody only gets 24 hours, and you get to choose how to spend it. So, take the stuff we talked about today and use that to help you balance your time on social media at work.

In today’s episode, we’re talking about how to create those little bite sized pieces of information. By keeping things crystal clear, your followers can understand what you’re saying to them and have a good feeling about your nonprofit organization.\xa0 Then as they get to know, like and trust you, they will keep coming back for more. This is a skill, and if you practice it, you’ll be amazed at the crowd you’ll begin to attract with your Facebook and Instagram posts. You have to remember two things about your people on social media: \xa0  Your Facebook and Instagram audiences’ attention span is short. You have SECONDS to make an impression on someone on social media, and if they don’t understand what you’re saying right off the bat, they’ll just scroll on by to the next thing they see on Facebook and Instagram.  They don’t know your nonprofit organization like you do. You might know every single detail about your nonprofit organization and how great your mission is. Seeing your organization’s Facebook and Instagram post might be the first time someone has ever heard of you, so get straight to the point with a bite sized message.  \xa0 Here are four easy, doable tips to help you create ULTRA CRYSTAL CLEAR messages: \xa0  Focus on ONE TOPIC per post.Knowing your brand helps you be clear when you talk about your nonprofit organization. In Episode 4, there is a fun quiz to help you figure out what the 3 – 5 most important things your nonprofit does. Once you identified those, then you can make those things into little bite sized pieces of information for posts.  Keep your posts simple.\xa0Try to give your audience a sip of water, not a drink from a firehose. You can do this by using the outline that WORKS!\xa0 Every post should have a picture, a caption and a call to action.\xa0 A picture can be an actual picture you have permission to use. A caption is 1-2 sentences with the main point of your post.\xa0 A call to action is when you tell your audience to call your phone number, or visit your website and you include the link.\xa0  Pretend you’re new in town.\xa0Don’t assume your audience knows anything about you. Talk to them like this is the first time they’re meeting you. Focus on keeping your posts simple and to one topic, and they will be able to learn about you a little at a time instead of just scrolling by because there is too much to read.  Give only the “Need to know” information.\xa0I know you might be tempted to share lots of information because you think it might help someone make up their mind, but if they don’t even read your message because you’ve overloaded it with details, then what’s the point?\xa0  So there you have it, four things you can do today to help your message be crystal clear. Focus on one topic per post, keep it simple, pretend like you’re new in town and give only the “need to know” info. If you apply these four things to everything in your nonprofit – your website, your emails, your events, all your different kinds of advertising, your social media, you will be amazed at how much of an impact you can have. Your words will have more impact because you removed all the clutter! Over time, your messages will bring new people to your nonprofit.\xa0 Keep showing up with clear messages and consistently. And always keep in mind WHY YOU ARE DOING THIS! It’s easy to get bogged down in the day to day stuff, but always remember your WHY. You are making a difference in the world. A big difference is the culmination of a lot of little steps.\xa0 So take that next little step today and make your message clear so your audience can understand you!\xa0 Remember to check out the free tools we have on NonprofitPotential.com like the FREE GUIDE that breaks down into easy-to-understand steps  What makes a good Facebook and Instagram Post I’d love to be friends and learn about what kind of nonprofit organization you work with so I can give you a shout out and use examples that apply to your situation – so keep in touch on Facebook and Instagram, just search for me under Nonprofit Potential.

EMAIL newsletters grow your relationships with donors, supporters and the people your nonprofit organization serves in your community.\xa0 OK, you know, I LOVE a good metaphor… So, here’s another one for you. Imagine that your donors and supporters are like plants growing in a garden. These plants get watered regularly with Facebook and Instagram. If you add in sending out consistent EMAIL – it’s like giving these plants FERTILIZER! If you tend to these plants with water AND fertilizer – those babies are going to be in full bloom year-round!\xa0 Why? Because according to recent research, people prefer email for communicating with the brands they’re connected with – yes that includes your nonprofit organization.\xa0 If your nonprofit has multiple audiences you are talking to (donors, supporters, people you serve), you can use separate email lists to nurture your relationships with each group.\xa0 Here are the 5 Things You NEED to Know About Email Newsletters:  Write a great subject line. Think about it – if you get an email with a weak or boring subject line, do you want to open that email? No… probably not! You might even just delete it without even opening it, especially if it’s a business or an organization. So, try to make your subject line genuine, interesting and of course, in-line with what your email is about.  Use the right framework: A picture, a paragraph and a call to action. Why? Because it WORKS! The picture captures someone’s attention right off the bat, the paragraph goes into more detail, and the call to action clearly lets that person know what they should do after they read the email.\xa0  Put the most important information first. Pretend like you only have ONE SENTENCE to tell someone what your email is about. Make that the first sentence of your email. Start strong and tell them right away what your email is about in that first\xa0 sentence.  Keep it simple and short. Your emails should be a quick and easy read and about ONE TOPIC. Try to keep your emails to about 200 words, or about 20 lines - if it needs to be longer, or shorter, that’s OK – but just remember, take out anything that your audience doesn’t have to know about. If it’s not going to help your audience take action, then leave it out. \xa0 Give them something. Give them a reason OPEN and read your email. Remember, they’re asking ‘Why does this matter to me?”  Earlier I mentioned having two email lists – one list for your donors and your supporters, and one for the people that you serve. Why two lists? Because you’re going to give these two groups of people two different things.\xa0 You’re going to give your donors and supporters the uplifting, positive feelings they get because they are helping the community or a cause. But again, keep it ONE TOPIC to an email.\xa0 For the people you serve, you’re giving them resources in your emails - small, digestible pieces of information that can help them with like a class or a freebie.\xa0 Serve your audiences through email. It’s all part of building that know, like and trust factor.\xa0 Try committing to sending out an email newsletter just once a month. If you LOVE writing emails and you thrive at it, you can work up to once a week, but again, the most important thing is that you are consistent. So, commit to a goal you can achieve. And finally, always remember WHY YOU ARE DOING THIS! I know there is so much day to day stuff that can be overwhelming and distracting from your purpose and your mission, but always remember your WHY. What was it that first inspired you to get involved with your nonprofit organization? Take ownership of that! Keep that fire burning! You are making a difference in the world. A big difference is the culmination of a lot of little steps. So, take that next little step today, and get to work on your next email! You ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE!

Is there a book there that you’ve seen time and time again, but you’ve never read it because maybe you don’t know what it’s about, or maybe the title is a little intimidating?\xa0 Well, today, we’re taking that book off the shelf… And we’re diving into an area that might be a little out of your comfort zone – we’re talking about Facebook and Instagram analytics – also known as, your social media stats! This is definitely something you should care about and that you can use as an awesome tool to help you know what kind of things you should post about, what time of day, and what days to post. It can also help you understand how to better market the services your nonprofit organization offers and communicate better with your audience. So, get ready, we’re taking that unread book off the shelf and wading into the waters of this technology today. And I predict that you’re going to feel A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE with your Facebook and Instagram stats! SO – Let’s start with Facebook …\xa0 Right underneath your nonprofit’s Facebook posts there are numbers. Know that things look a little different if you’re on your phone or if you’re on a computer, but that’s ok, you can find out the same stats. Here’s how: If you’re looking at a post on your phone, it will say People Reached and if you’re on a computer, it will also say Engagements.\xa0 “People Reached” is the number of people who saw your post. It means, your post came across the screens of that number of different people.\xa0 A couple of ways to up this number is by posting consistently and always remember to ask yourself, “What is my audience going to get out of this post?” That will keep you on track for posting good content!\xa0 TIP: Two things that are popular across Facebook and Instagram accounts are how-to types of posts and inspirational quotes.\xa0Check out Episode 2 for a deeper dive into this.\xa0 Now, you might be like “Well, hey that’s all well and good, but what, is Facebook going to just KNOW if something is good or not and then make it show up on more people’s screens?”\xa0 That, my friend, brings us to the next little stat you should pay attention to…\xa0 Engagements is the number underneath your nonprofit’s post just to the right of People Reached on a computer. Engagements are any action someone takes on your post.\xa0 You’ll see a whole new world of information by clicking on Engagements or People Reached – try checking it out – especially on a computer because it really gets into detail. It’s like tracing your posts’ steps across the internet! You can see WHAT WORKS. You can see what your audience is interested in. You can see what action someone took when they saw your post – for example, comment, like, share, visit your link. This is important because the more Engagement, the more reach your post will have. When you have a post that works – KEEP DOING THAT!\xa0 Let that post inspire you to create other posts that are similar. One more thing about Facebook and then we are going to move on to Instagram… Click on the INSIGHTS tab at the top of your nonprofit’s page, scroll down on the Insights Page, you’ll see your most recent posts. That’s where you can actually SEE which ones have performed better than others. INSTAGRAM\xa0 Look at Instagram on your phone – make sure you are signed into your nonprofit organization’s account. AND if you need a refresher on that, there’s a link for a quick tutorial at the bottom of these show notes.\xa0 Once you’re logged onto your nonprofit’s Instagram account… - Go to your profile and click on one of your posts. -\xa0 Under the picture, you’ll see it says VIEW INSIGHTS in little blue words, right under the picture. If you don’t see it, double check to make sure you’re logged into your nonprofit’s Instagram account – not your personal account. -\xa0 Tap View Insights and a little window will pop up on the bottom of the screen, tap that and it will get bigger.\xa0 There, YOU CAN SEE ALL YOUR STATS for that post.\xa0 You’ll see reach, which is the same thing as it is on Facebook You’ll also see Interactions... Interactions means when someone went to your profile to see more of your posts and find out more about you. Insights on Instagram shows how many individual accounts you reached, what percentage weren’t following you – that’s a good number to know, because it will tell you if you’re reaching NEW people. You can also see Impressions and find out if your hashtags were effective.\xa0 If you want to practice with hashtags, check out Episode 8 – it’s full of step-by-step, easy to understand instructions for Instagram. Try exploring all these different stats on both Facebook and Instagram and use them to help you know what you’re doing right. If you just take a little time to look at these numbers, regularly you’ll feel more confident and you’ll be able to know what’s working and where you’re doing the right thing!\xa0 Three things to REMEMBER:\xa0  Keep your posts short and sweet Use good pictures Make your content worthwhile to your audience  And hey, seriously… YOU CAN DO THIS! Keep your eye on the prize – you are using Facebook and Instagram, or the “new word of mouth” to reach the people you want to serve. Remember – you don’t have to do everything and learn everything in one day! Baby steps still move you forward!

If links are not visible in your podcast app, visit the Episode Webpage and Show Notes at https://nonprofitpotential.com/12 | In a special addition to last week’s episode about the Three Step Plan for Event Marketing (Episode 10) this week, we’re talking about what to do after your event and why it’s important to keep up the marketing with Facebook, Instagram and emails even after the big day has come and gone. If you’re like me, your favorite part of the event is after it’s over… The stress of all the planning and making sure everything happens the way it’s supposed to is over.\xa0 You want to sit back and smile at all the things that went right and make note of things that didn’t go as you planned.\xa0\xa0 But if you want to finish strong and take advantage of the opportunity you have to grow your next event; you can’t quit thinking about it just yet. You’ve got to bring it all full circle. Posting on Facebook and Instagram after the party lets everyone remember how great it was and feel like they were part of something special. And everyone who WASN’T there sees what they missed out on. Create some of that FOMO – that fear of missing out – and make them want to attend your next event! Posting about it on social media is also a great way to pour on the gratitude – something you can’t do enough of. And in this day and age, Facebook and Instagram have that INSTANT GRATIFICATION factor – people want to re-live what they experienced ASAP – so posting pictures and thank yous on social media within a day or two is a great way to cement people’s positive feelings about your event and make them want to be involved again next year. Now, I think we can all agree that the day after an event are all about recovery. You’re exhausted. You’re worn out. You don’t want to do anything. So that’s why if you take these 3 steps before the big event, you can make your life a whoooole lot easier afterwards. If you do these three things to do before the event – if you don’t, you’ll wish you had!\xa0  Ask two volunteers to take pictures with their phones at the event – even if you have a professional photographer Draft a thank you email to your attendees before the event. (don’t send it until after the event) Leave space in the email to add one of those pictures your volunteers took from the event. Pour on the thank yous to any and every one that helped you in anyway.\xa0 Write a short thank you note, add a piece of chocolate and leave it on their desk.\xa0 Bonus! Don’t forget to add all the names of the attendees to your database for next year.  If you have any questions, I’d love to hear them so we can answer them in an upcoming episode, and you’ll be helping others who might have the same questions!\xa0 I absolutely LOVE hearing from you. Get in touch by going to NonprofitPotential.com/contact and let me know what questions you have. Remember to subscribe to the Unlocking Your Nonprofit Potential Podcast on iTunes, Stitcher or your favorite podcast player… And you can also listen directly on website NonProfitPotential.com and sign up for email reminders there, too.\xa0 I want to know what kind of nonprofit you’re working with!

No, not like paying someone to show up and throw sod down or put those perfectly pre-grown squares of grass across the ground… But have you actually spread out dirt yourself, and then tossed grass seed on the ground, raked it over, and prayed for it to start growing?\xa0 That’s what I’ve been doing at my house – trying to grow grass.\xa0 The other day, I was about to just quit. I had had enough. I was so tired of putting all this time and effort into trying to get something to grow that just wasn’t going to… and literally, as I was walking back to the house to turn the water back on, feeling hopeless and like I was pointlessly watering dirt, I looked down and saw… A BLADE OF GRASS. A single blade had popped up through the soil!\xa0 Immediately, my motivation was RENEWED. Since then, I have continued watering, and now, I have THOUSANDS of blades of grass coming up from the ground!! It gives me hope that it might actually turn into a lawn one day! I know this sounds cheesy, but I couldn’t help but feel like this was an analogy for SO MANY THINGS in our lives. Especially for getting the word out about your nonprofit.\xa0 There might be times where you feel like you are just wasting your time.\xa0 You feel discouraged and you just want to quit.\xa0 It may seem like there is NO POINT in continuing on.\xa0 I’m telling you – if you just keep showing up and clearly telling people what you do, it’s only a matter of time before you see growth. In today’s episode, I’m sharing with you my three step plan for marketing your next event. This is a short-term effort that can yield major growth for your organization especially in terms of support and donors - which is why it’s so important. Facebook is an INCREDIBLE tool to use to market your event. It’s a great way to get the word out, build excitement, engage with your audience before the event, and build that know, like and trust factor that is so important in having a successful organization. I know, there are some people who say, “people don’t use Facebook anymore,” but friend, the numbers don’t lie. One of the largest research studies to date on the status of the event industry showed that 52% of professional event planners said that Facebook is the most effective social media channel for event marketing. Your Facebook event page will be the place people can turn to for event details like start time, where to sign up or buy tickets, information about the speaker or performers. Plus, if you keep updating your Facebook page, it will only help your credibility and grow your online presence.\xa0 When your audience keeps seeing you active on Facebook, it helps them feel more confident about committing to going to your event. Here is my THREE-STEP PLAN for getting started with marketing your event on Facebook  Create the event on Facebook ASAP Plan Your Posts Boost your post  When you listen to Episode 10 today, you’ll hear tips and tricks about all three steps.\xa0 You’ll find out what to include on the Facebook event page, how to come up with 15 – 18 ideas for posts that you can use over and over again, and when you should begin to market your event.\xa0 Plus, we’ll talk about the very important topic of money and ideas for working within your budget – there are so many! Remember, the grass I talked about? You keep showing up to listen to this podcast, you are working smart on your nonprofit – it’s going to grow. You’ve got this! Every time you feel overwhelmed by something, especially if it’s new, just remind yourself of WHY you are doing this! Because you want to reach the people you want to serve! Because you want to make a difference! I know you might have questions, and I’d love to hear them so we can address them in future episodes! I absolutely LOVE hearing from you.

And let me guess, social media is always one of those nagging things on that list, right?\xa0 Today, I’m going to give you a few steps you can take to train a volunteer to help you with Facebook and Instagram posts and give you more time to check other things off that to-do list! First things first – taking care of your organization’s social media is not a job for just any warm body. There are three qualities to look for in that person.  They have to have a passion for your cause It’s important that they are not intimidated by social media\xa0 They are a person you like working with  Does anyone you know to mind? You might have found the right person to help you with social media. “Help” is the key word there - you’re looking for help, not someone to do it all for you. No one knows your organization better than you, and no one is more passionate about your organization than you are. You are the heart and soul of it. You can have someone help you with social media and help you come up with ideas, but it’s a good idea to stay involved in what is being posted, at least until your volunteer is fully trained. Be sure to set expectations. Show examples of the kind of posts you want. Decide your “call to action.” Have your new social media helper listen to this podcast - it will help them understand your strategy, mission, and how to communicate that to others through social media.\xa0 Keys to making things effective and efficient:  Give your volunteer a clear picture of who your audience is by sharing your notes from the ideal customer quiz from Episode 7.\xa0Your helper needs to know who the post is being written for - that makes all the difference. Come up with a schedule. For example, tell them you want to have posts go out on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Practice in a Word document. On Monday, the volunteer can sit down and plan out what those two posts will be. By creating posts in Word, changes can be made and you can approve or edit them before they go out. Have your volunteer save the large sized photos/graphics for posts in a folder for easy uploading to Facebook and Instagram.  Remember, you are making a difference in your community, don’t shortchange that! Don’t pass off your social media to someone who doesn’t care –social media matters.\xa0 Your consistent presence and clear message are often times a first impression to your community. This is YOUR MISSION. You have a passion for this, and Facebook and Instagram can expand your reach to more people. Use social media as a tool. Be bigger and better with the help of a volunteer!

Thank you! | It seems like everybody likes Instagram, but not everybody knows how to use it. Even some of the smartest, brightest, most tech-savvy people I know still get confused on how to use Instagram Today, we are walking you through the very basics. Yes, Instagram 101. We’ll talk about the most important parts, the things you should be doing on a regular basis when you’re posting for your nonprofit, and I’ve got some tips on making sure the people in your local area see your posts. First things first, Instagram is designed to be used on your phone. You can sign into your Instagram account on a computer, but it’s confusing to use and some parts of it don’t even work on a computer, so get in the habit of using it on your phone. Instagram has two main features – the Feed and Stories. The Feed is the big square pictures you see as soon as you open up the app. It’s where all the pictures show up from the people you follow. When you create a new post on your profile, it appears in the Feed. Stories are in that little line of circle pictures above the Feed.\xa0\xa0 The biggest difference between the Feed and Stories, is that Stories only last for 24 hours and then they are deleted. Each person’s story is only 15 seconds long, max, but you can record an entire series of 15 second stories and they will play like one long one. Just like on Facebook, you need to have a great Instagram profile that has all of your contact information, your website, your address, a great bio – because when people discover you on Instagram, they will be heading to your profile to learn more about you. Be sure to include at least your city and state. An example of a great Instagram bio for a kids’ after school program: “Helping kids build self-confidence with fitness.” Here are 4 things to keep in mind as you recycle your Facebook posts into Instagram posts:  Make your captions Instagram-friendly. Add hashtags. Use popular local hashtags, like #InBend or #BoiseLife Add a location. Post to your Story.  Tip: To delete something from your story like the date, text, emoji, location or something - just hold down on it with your finger and drag it to the trash can that appears. Challenge: Search for a popular public place in your area and like 5 photos from people that recently checked in there. Send me an email!

Susan is an author and executive coach, who reached out to me while she was researching for a series of articles on self-care for nonprofit leaders for Charity Channel (link below).\xa0 She is an expert on self-care for nonprofit leaders (really for all leaders). Having spent 30 years in nonprofit and as a fundraising coach, she has seen all the terrible things we do to our selves and the consequences of a lack of self-care on our ability to do our work. This is such an important issue, and we clicked so much, that we talked about it for over an hour.

Think back to this time last year. Were you launching a performing arts season? Getting back to work in schools? How about personally? What were you like as a person?\xa0 \xa0 12 months ago, I was very happy with my job, but I wasn\'t completely happy with myself as a person. I was impatient and easily stressed out, and my health was on the verge of some bad preventable disease. I knew I didn\'t want to be in the same place by the next year, so I took steps to make a change.\xa0 \xa0 As Summer is winding down, let\'s not forget that the fourth quarter of this year will be here before we know it. Most of us in nonprofit associate year-end with fundraising, and that is still important. But what if you expanded your vision of what could happen over the next few months? What would your organization look like by the first of next year?\xa0 \xa0 I can already hear those of you who are Questioners in the "Four Tendencies" framework (created by Gretchen Rubin) asking me why it\'s important to even be thinking about these things right now. After all January 1st is just another day on the calendar. The thing is, in our society and culture, the end of one year and the beginning of the next carries a wave of transition energy with it. The closing of one chapter and the beginning of another.

When you look taking a sabbatical and we decided to put one forward where people of a certain point in the organization get one month off - paid at some point in time, they become available. Sabbaticals become available every five years. They’re based on seniority. So when I institute this, we took our most senior people and we limited them to two. We said two people can go every year. What you find out, is other people get to step up. People who are in sort of subordinate positions have to step up into the leadership position to take on some of those tasks for a month. You begin thinking a little bit differently about what you do as an organization. Most importantly, you give leadership lessons and on the job training to people who are your future leaders in the organization. I can tell you after doing this for six years we have seen some people graduate into those roles because they show themselves to be more than ready to take on some responsibilities that we hadn\'t been asking them to do. I\'ve not heard one complaint so far. You hear people talking years out what they\'re going to do, and I think it\'s become something that helps us provide a little bit more people to get them to be happier in their work. As organizations, we don\'t have unlimited resources. We have to try to find those ways in which you could fill that pot with as much good stuff as you can often make up for a salary request. We’re trying to fill that place to really walk the walk, not just talk the talk about what makes us a good organization to work for. This is something we feel really firm about. | Transcript: My journey is not a fairytale journey, I think by any means. And I\xa0think that\'s where my kind of explains to you somewhere I guess I saw some things, and I wanted to do some things differently. \xa0 But most of that started with me. Because at that point in time in my life I started saying so what\'s in it for me what\'s in it for Chrissy. So what\'s the next step, right? So I got my degree. I\'m ready to go like I want to be a director. I want to be a VP - \xa0let\'s let\'s do it! \xa0 But that didn\'t come. And so I remember sitting there and I asked for promotions. I wrote really great letters that said why I should have been promoted. All of which got turned down by the CEO who just left - who is like my dad to me- an amazing man who really helped to build the character and me to help me transition into the CEO role. \xa0 But he turned me down many, many times and I remember walking out of his office going back. I felt like \xa0I know nothing and I don\'t know what he\'s talking about. \xa0I certainly deserve to be promoted. This is the next step. \xa0 I remember one day I came home and I was talking to my husband. I said \xa0"I just don\'t get it. I love the credit union. I absolutely am in love with the industry and what the Credit Union Industry stands for. I love the people I work with, but it\'s just not fitting, I am I missing something. \xa0 That\'s when I kind of (figuratively) got smacked in the face by my husband (he\'s very good to me) and he said, and it was it was you - it\'s you, Chrissy. You\'re the problem. You\'re always looking for that self serving purpose. You\'re looking for the what\'s in it for Chrissy and what\'s next for Chrissy. You\'re not thinking about how do you go into that place every day and serve to exist or exist to serve others? And i remember going, oh my gosh, like that\'s the point that I\'m missing, I\'m in a service industry, but I\'m meant to be a servant to the people that I\'m working with and working for and the people that I was leading at that time. | We are taking our own advice and we are going to take a hiatus from producing weekly podcasts at PureReinvention. We have a big event coming up (Connect: Detroit on May 22 - there\'s still time to register) \xa0and all of us here feel that we need to take a step back and assess how we can best build and present future content in more digestible and diverse ways. In order to make that happen, we need to take the advice we give so freely and take a timeout to assess how we can best create and convey future content to you. We meet and get inspired by many people in our PureReinvention journey and we will continue to share their stories with you. Audio podcasts will certainly play a role, but we want to add to the mix through other means of communication by adding video and blogs. We want to keep things fresh and present the content to you in a way that entertains as well as useful to you. In the meantime, tell us what you think. What do you like about our podcasts? What would you like to see changed? This is an invitation to connect with us. We certainly would love to hear from you! Stay tuned to this channel for future updates and remember, if you\'re ready to make a change, make it a change that lasts, make it PureReinvention! | Want to see reinvention in action? Look no further than the former Michigan Lodging and Tourism Association (now Check In Michigan). They have a new and innovative executive director and a board that is dedicated to serving the next generation in the Michigan hospitality industry. They hired the firm, Advance 360 to help guide them through the initial stage of this transition. Learn how reinvention ready organizations commence sustainable reinvention. \xa0 QUOTE IT \xa0 “It’s not a linear process by any means.” (9:07) “Yes, the landscape is changing, but our role and how we champion this industry hasn’t changed.” (12:59) “(Aspiration) not a dream state. It’s a destination that we have our eye and finger on.” (14:55) \xa0 \xa0 DIG IN \xa0  (7:29) The feeling. The brand took flight. (10:22) Serious movement. (13:36) Engaging the marketplace. (14:59) Synchronizing collaboration. (18:16) Sifting through the raw data.  \xa0 Tip of the Week A brand is more than a logo. A brand expresses the organizational culture. \xa0 \xa0 | The interviews we conducted this month profiled success stories in reinvention readiness. Both  Erin Patten and  Dene Westbrook were ready to take the reinvention plunge. What did they have in common? We believe that they both had the four pillars of reinvention readiness: desire, curiosity, flexibility and confidence. Everything begins with a desire to change your situation. Both Erin and Dene surrounded themselves with people who inspired them and pushed them to take the next step. Both Dene and Erin also had Curiosity. A reinvention journey thrives on curiosity. They asked lots of questions and went outside their respective comfort zones. They also showed flexibility. Successful reinvention only happens when you stretch your flexibility. You have to listen to the people you\'ve surrounded yourself with and keep all options open. Finally, both showed confidence. Once they did their homework, got a support group and they moved forward with the plan. \xa0  Want some help in your reinvention journey? Download this infographic (from the mobile app or go to our website) which can serve as a bookmark or an image you can keep by your desk. \xa0 \xa0 QUOTE IT \xa0 “(0:44) "Are you willing to take on a new role?" \xa0 “(5:11) "The power of taking pause." \xa0 DIG IN  (0:31) Flexibility. (2:59) Curiosity. (4:40) Confidence. (7:41) Desire.  \xa0 Tip of the Week Confidence is the fourth pillar of reinvention readiness. Rely on your support group and plan to give you the added boost you need to move things forward. \xa0 \xa0 | Erin Patten is very accomplished with a Harvard business degree and a Kresge Fellow highlighting her impressive resume. She walked away from the standard career path to chase her dream of being an entrepreneur. In January 2018 she launched DaO Detroit. DaO stands for "defy all odds" and Erin personifies that sentiment. \xa0 QUOTE IT \xa0 “[My big leap] A natural progression of my career journey, my life journey. It just had to happen.” (3:21) \xa0 “Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.” –Lao Tzu (6:33) \xa0 \xa0 DIG IN  (2:56) Disrupting one’s economic livelihood and thriving beyond fear. (4:59) Simplify your messaging. (10:04, 11:47) Connecting to the marketplace.  \xa0 Tip of the Week Flexibility is the third pillar of reinvention readiness. Keep all options open. \xa0 \xa0 | Dene is a graduate of our STARTERS program last May. We saw from the beginning that she was reinvention ready and was in a great position to fly with her new promotion and added responsibilities with the Michigan Municipal League. Dene is a perfect example of what it takes to be reinvention ready. Listen as Mike talks to Dene about how she has built a network of support from her STARTERS experience and has excelled in her new position. \xa0 QUOTE IT \xa0 “I certainly have enough room to make my stamp on this place and strive for everything I want it to be.” (10:30) \xa0 \xa0 DIG IN  (3:02) Knowing when you’re reinvention ready. (4:50) A pivot in your style. (9:01) Building on ah ha moments. (11:43) From a doer to a communicator.  \xa0 Tip of the Week Curiosity is the second pillar of reinvention readiness.

(3:27) Curious; lean in. (8:50) Confidence. (9:44) Desire.  \xa0 Tip of the Week Desire is the first pillar of reinvention readiness. You have to really want to change if you’re going to be successful. | We end our focus on the fundamentals of move and the value of storytelling with a great discussion between Mike Bills and Jodi Schafer. We learned from our month\'s guests the value of storytelling to move ideas forward. We also learn the value of connecting with others emotionally using shared experiences and values. \xa0 QUOTE IT \xa0 “At the core, it’s about connecting with people on a very real level.” (1:49) \xa0 \xa0 DIG IN \xa0  (1:17, 1:30) Back to basics. (2:34) Multidimensional storytelling. (9:03) Be unique and fluid.  \xa0 Tip of the Week Approach customers and stakeholders with "what do you need?" rather than "this is what I do." \xa0 \xa0 | Cornetta suffered a tragedy not so long ago by losing her father and found out about the details on the evening news. She needed to process her grief and took the opportunity to share her father\'s story through the Secret Society of Twisted Storytellers. Cornetta found that process to be so cathartic that she has dedicated her career to helping others to tell their stories. Listen as Mike talks to Cornetta about how storytelling helps to heal and the value of telling your own story. \xa0 QUOTE IT \xa0 “(Storytelling) It was impactful to me.” (12:58) \xa0 "It didn’t exist so I created it.” (18:18) \xa0\xa0 DIG IN \xa0  (11:08) Transferring the value of storytelling.

At the heart of the organization is Brian Paul and his ever-extending network of resources. Brian Paul, President, and Founder of Veterans4LifeUSA served in the 45th Infantry Division as a rifleman, machine gunner, and mortarman. His team provided security and other services at the Alfred P Murrah bombing site following the terrorist attack on April 19th, 1995. He has also served as a firefighter and EMT in Kansas City. Brian Paul enjoyed success in both the military and in his time as a Firefighter and EMT but like many others, he ran head-on into serious and life-threatening problems largely due to his “no quit” personality.\xa0 He believed in his mission of service even when he knew it was costing him his health and eventually would likely cost him his life. Brian began dealing with the extreme stresses of his job by self-medicating with alcohol. This, coupled with extraordinary stress from being a first responder, led him to a very real and dangerous problem with post-traumatic stress known as PTSD.\xa0 This problem led to not only rapidly deteriorating health but also to divorce and even homelessness. Brian was simply fighting for his life. With God’s help and the help of his family, Brian was finally able to find the correct and proper help he desperately needed and with very little time to spare. Brian went through an intensive 90-day treatment program in the Smokey Mountains that dealt with his PTSD and alcohol problems simultaneously.\xa0 Brian was extremely successful with this treatment for three main reasons: He was finally receiving the correct and proper treatment specifically for him. He used the same intense focus and determination that made him a successful soldier and firefighter and directed it towards his treatment. He has an unbreakable connection with his higher power as he viewed it. Brian has been sober, happy, and successful since Nov. 20, 2015, and focuses sharply on helping fellow soldiers and first responders, including law enforcement, avoid and overcome similar serious obstacles he himself has experienced and overcome. Brian started Veterans4LifeUSA to help other veterans and first responders who struggle with PTSD and addiction. The focus of Veterans4LifeUSA is to connect veterans, first responders, and their families to resources where they can find healing. They also create events and environments where veterans and first responders can build camaraderie and fellowship with others. We hope to continue and build relationships and provide resources for veterans and first responders who struggle no matter where they may be. veterans4lifeusa@gmail.com Facebook \xa0 \xa0 | Join Dave as we discuss the importance of strategic partnerships, events beyond nonprofits and finding a mission after military life.

This included coaching veterans into the paths of education, employment, and entrepreneurship. \xa0In 2014, he had the honor of speaking at TEDxTulsa about veteran transition, and this has led to a number of speaking opportunities.

There is so much free content out there that can really be helpful to get you started. But that’s the thing. It’s there to get you started. If you’re someone that is constantly consuming free content, you might just be addicted to the free swag. The free swag will only get you so far my friends. It’s time to think about if it’s time to invest in yourself and your organization! But Who Am I? Hi! I'm Lisa Clark and I help nonprofits and fundraisers like YOU raise money through events so you can meet your annual revenue goals!

I included a link below so you can request to join right away! Link to Join Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/112148672944584 What Is Swag? We’ve all received some sort of swag. From little stress balls, cooling packs, to pens, we’ve all gotten little freebies from different organizations or businesses. Companies push out swag in order to attract people to them. They want to attract you so that they can get to know who you are and pitch a product or service to you. Others use it as a thank you and they want to be the brand in your home and in your life. It’s a way to get their name in front of your face so it stays in the forefront of your mind. Sometimes you get things that are super useful and practical. Other times it’s just a bunch of junk collecting in a corner that you never look at. A lot of it just simply provides you very little value. Soaking In The Free Content I know there are a lot of you out there that are taking in a lot of free content or swag out there on the internet. You watch the free webinars, watch all the videos, but don’t commit to buying the product. The free content that people are posting online is to attract you to their community or product, where you’ll get even more tools. Something that will give you incredible value. This free content that you are consuming is great to get you started, but is it really the way to go? Piecing This Together Take all the free content in the world, can be beneficial. DOn’t get me wrong gaining knowledge is something that I can only commend. However, if you’re trying to piece together everything in your nonprofit from free content, it’s going to show. It’s going to be apparent that you’ve pieced this together, and while it has some value it needs more. Investing in your Organization If you’re stuck in this “free zone” within your organization, I have to encourage you to invest in it. Putting money into your organization to move it forward can result in a bigger payoff for your organization in fundraising, or just help you move the needle to make it better. Looking to the experts in this field will help you build strategies to continue to grow and become bigger and better! Also, it’ll take the stress off you feeling like you are missing that missing piece you keep searching for. Look to the people that have been in this game for a while now. You don’t have to make the same mistakes. You can learn from them. You don’t have to keep feeling alone in this. You can invest in yourself and your nonprofit to take the next big step.

This particular event went towards remodeling and making homes safe in the San Francisco Bay area. This includes changing out plumbing, re-roofing the home, fixing the electrical or whatever might be necessary. This is an organization that has been around for 30 years, and this particular event has been hosted by the Stanford Shopping Center for 17 years. Needless to say, there are many key takeaways you can incorporate into your events to make them successful like ours was! But Who Am I? Hi! I'm Lisa Clark and I help nonprofits and fundraisers like YOU raise money through events so you can meet your annual revenue goals! I'm also the host of a free Facebook Group, Raising with Lisa Clark, a free group for fundraisers, NPOs, development team members, volunteers, and supporters. I included a link below so you can request to join right away! Link to Join Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/112148672944584 The Gala Itself I had the honor of helping with this event this year, and I am so proud of the success that we’ve had. Historically, they have used the same set-up and on average has raised $400,000 to $500,000 run by volunteers. There are usually around 300-400 attendants. It didn’t start this way, but this is a longstanding successful event that has slowly evolved to be as successful as they have been. They use five different revenue streams in order to achieve their fundraising goals:  Ticket Sales A Raffle An Auction Fund A Need Underwriting Packages  They have a great partnership with Stanford Shopping Center and the auction items that they promote. The main feature is life-size playhouses that are absolutely huge and gorgeous. Some even have to be moved by crane! While this is quite an undertaking, this is an incredibly fruitful event for this organization. Changing It Up With Fund A Need In the past, the organization would auction off 12 of these houses, but this year they implemented Fund-A-Need due to the decline of the number of funds raised from auctioning off the playhouses. Decreasing the number of houses on auction, and creating these Fund A Need options allowed there to be more opportunities for people to donate who otherwise couldn’t have. Creating this new source of revenue paid off! Having a Ton of Options Any large auction that I have attended has an option for everyone’s pocketbook. While you could think that it could be overwhelming for your guests, having more options that can appeal to any budget will only bring you more funds for your organization. People will donate if they have the option. Opening up this new revenue stream, allowed the attendees to donate even if bidding on the playhouses wasn’t something that they could afford. Organizing the Fundraiser In the past, this event has been run heavily by volunteers with the Director of Development overseeing things. There were different chairs that took care of the playhouses and maintaining the relationship with the Shopping Center and the builders. Then there were two people that oversaw the decor. There would also be a committee chair that would oversee the auction to make sure that it all ran smoothly and the auction items were organized. The Registration Team would also be in place to get people signed up, pass out name tags, etc. This year, with Fund A Need in place, there was a pre-registration option for people’s credit cards for when they would bid on the playhouses. A team would also be assigned for recruiting auction items and sponsorships from shops within the center. The final team would then go to restaurants to solicit for catering options for the event. In our case, we were able to get McDonald’s french fries, Sprinkles Cupcakes, California Pizza Kitchen and more. Having these different team can sound like a lot, but having different teams assigned to these teams really helped to ensure that things were planned. As this event was mainly run by volunteers in the past, this year they brought me on because there were many volunteers that weren’t able to return to help. This changed things up, but in the end, recruiting help was necessary to have this event run smoothly this year. It was also beneficial to bring help on, as Fund A Need was a new thing they decided to put into place. Sometimes getting help with your event can pay off in a big way! Underwriting Packages For Sale In partnership with the Development Team and the Executive Director, the Underwriting Chair made a home run with selling underwriting packages! This package includes being featured on all the possible places that the event was being promoted. In our case, there were banners in the shopping center, on the event’s website, social media, and more. Not only that, these sponsors received perks that were exclusive to these packages. The sponsors get tickets to invite their own guests, have a VIP table, had access to \xa0Champagne and Wine(Thanks Tesla!), early check-in, and front row access passes to the auction. These kinds of packages are really appealing to businesses and big spenders. Offering them are a nice way for people to be able to simply help your organization and have you thank them for being involved! Marketing The Event This organization took advantage of both the old fashioned and new ways of generating interest in the event. This included:  Email Marketing Social Media Facebook Ads Advertising Banners in the shopping center Hard Copy Invitations Local Publications  While I don’t have access to the stats from the Facebook Ads, they were able to attract attention to the organization through them. Without these ads, the event may not have reached the locals that it would have otherwise not been in front of. Taking advantage of social media is a great way to get in the face of new people for your organization. If you would like guidance in how to promote your event through social media be sure to check out my course: https://www.raisingwithlisaclark.com/offers/DhnDgrxn/checkout Investing in Your Event The full scope of this event was huge! Seeing 500 chairs dropped off by a rental company can seem crazy. Then there are the catering fees, beverage fees, etc. to tag on top of everything else. This event cost the organization around $60,000, but they raised $470,000. What I’m here to tell you is that if you invest in an event, you will see the return on investment. I encourage you to make a bold move to try something new! \xa0 What I also want to point out, is don’t be afraid of the numbers that I reference. My numbers are going to be different than yours. While I might have had to spend $2,000 for a venue, you might only need to spend $300. Get out there and start getting quotes. Know what’s available to you and don’t be afraid thinking an event is going to cost you a crazy amount! This will be different for each event, based on location and time of the year. \xa0 Getting Help This is an established and fairly successful organization, but things have to change with the times sometimes. WIth the lack of available volunteers and then having volunteers need to fulfill other obligations in their life, there was a lot of pressure put onto the event board to help this fundraising event come together. The choice this organization made to get the help they needed, was essential in my opinion to help this event continue to be successful and fruitful. While I think we all are self starters who want to do it all, there are times when changing up how you run things can keep you from floundering in the end. \xa0 If you’ve been thinking about investing in my course “Fundraising Events that Deliver” now is the time to do it!

People will have different motivation behind their annual giving. It could be someone who just kind of picks an organization at random every year to give to. There are others that have a family trust that they discuss with the members of their family what organization they are going to give to. Then there are those people that have directly been affected by your organization whether that be through your products and services, or your mission aligns with their values. There are others to consider, but I wanted to list these to get the ball rolling. --- Want to learn more?

That’s not to say that I don’t appreciate the raffle items that I’ve seen donated over the years or the funds they helped to bring. I genuinely do. I just know that there are definitely ways to make raffles more fun, more inviting, and more exciting! But Who Am I? Hi! I'm Lisa Clark and I help nonprofits and fundraisers like YOU raise money through events so you can meet your annual revenue goals! I'm also the host of a free Facebook Group, Raising with Lisa Clark, a free group for fundraisers, NPOs, development team members, volunteers, and supporters. I included a link below so you can request to join right away! Link to Join Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/112148672944584 It’s Been The Same Since the 90’s... Back in the day, the organization I worked with hosted a raffle. We sent out letters to every restaurant and merchant in the community. Everyone got a letter! What ended up happening is we got tons of gift certificates to put up for raffle, weekend, packages, and over 200 individual items for this raffle! I’m referencing this raffle because people are still doing things the same, and it’s time to shake it up. Tons of Winners We had tons of people winning. Every 15 minutes we would be able to announce a winner! This got the audience into wanting to bid on items. We had the items go so fast that people were excited to bid on the next ones! This got them frantic but in a good way to open their wallets and donate to the cause! Another example is if you are only having one big raffle, why not have a few? This ups how many chances there are to win. Instead of having 1 out of 600 chance of winning, the chances go up to 1 out of 200! We’re currently experimenting with this with the raffle I’m currently working on at Stanford and we’re genuinely excited about it! Having more winners announced also helps people to stay to the end because they want to win. Make Packages We made packages of the items that we received. This makes the items more exciting. For example for a date night you might include: -A spa treatment -Wine gift certificate -Cheeses -Movie Tickets All this could be in one basket to put up for bid. Be sure to get creative to make your items more valuable! You might think you don’t want these small items that companies might give you. But honestly, you do! Just buff them up with a few other items and you have a wonderful item to put up for raffle. When You Have a Large Crowd Now, in the past I helped with an event that had around 800 people. Let me tell you, having 100 items up for raffle and then trying to keep 800 people’s attention is pretty impossible. So what I will say about this is that when you have that large of a crowd, announcing winners every ten minutes does not work as well. People stop paying attention and it just gets a little chaotic. So stick to around 200 or so for this technique. Don’t Be Lazy Fundraisers I know this talk is not necessarily the longest or most in depth but raffles have stayed the same for as long as I can remember. So I want you to change it up! Don’t be afraid to get creative! What are things you’ve seen that are effective? What are the most interesting strategies you’ve seen at events! I want to know! Be sure to watch the video to hear some of the creative events that I’ve been to in the past. --- Want to learn more?

Each aspect of an event will have its own production timeline in place. In my opinion, it isn’t necessary. In my experience, keeping it simple while having every one informed in the way to go. So let me share my advice to help you create the best possible event production you can for your fundraising events! But Who Am I? Hi! I'm Lisa Clark and I help nonprofits and fundraisers like YOU raise money through events so you can meet your annual revenue goals! I'm also the host of a free Facebook Group, Raising with Lisa Clark, a free group for fundraisers, NPOs, development team members, volunteers, and supporters. I included a link below so you can request to join right away! Link to Join Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/112148672944584 Committee Timelines Each team should have their own event production timeline made in order to map out their responsibilities. Especially if they have tasks that have nothing to do with anyone else. Everyone needs to do what’s right for them if you have many sub-committees. Even when you are just a one to two person team running this event, having each group of tasks broken down can be helpful. A Two Timeline System This type of system has worked really well for events I’ve been involved in that are for auctions. They will split it up into the tasks that need to be done before the event and then the day of the event. This can be helpful so that you stay focused on task and with auctions, you know if you have hosted one, that there are a lot of moving parts that need to work together the day of the event. It really just depends on what system would work for you. Snapshot Calendar These are just calendars set up with the basics. It helps to have a visual and it’s easy to send out to everyone on your team. You could even have this set up in Google Calendar and share it with everyone! Then they’ll all have the dates in place to know what days that all the different aspects of the event are taking place. Personally, I like this method as it’s an easy visual and keeps everyone informed. Here’s the way I like it… Personally, I prefer an all encompassing document that is easiest to format within Excel or Google sheets. There will be two tabs at the bottom. The first has a master timeline with everything in it. Catering, decor, solicitation, etc. up to 6 to 9 months before the event happens. Then the day of tasks will also be included. The second tab will be that same thing broken up by each committee. This tab will just have it broken down with the tasks assigned with each specific committee. Keep this simple. There doesn’t need to be a lot of details in this. This is supposed to be a document that is quick and easy for everyone to view so that they are informed! Why I find this helpful is because if you’re just getting a question answered and you want to know when a certain thing is happening in regards to your event, you’re able to look at the document and know! It streamlines communication so that other people can coordinate. Everything is mapped out for you so you can see it month by month for everyone. Project Management Tools There are tons of project management platforms that can help you with organizing your events. Here are just a few:  Trello Asana Monday  If there are things that aren’t able to fit into your master timelines, then you can use one of these project management tools to help you organize each committee. It helps to make checklists and assign people specific tasks with more details. They can also be used to have documents all in one place. I hope that you can take away some advice from this episode to help your events be as easy as possible to coordinate.

These are just some of the things that can be daunting when planning your first event. Trying to determine how much of beverages you need to purchase, thinking of how people are eating at your event, the time weath, etc. It’s a lot to think about and I hope this episode gives you a nice guide to determining these things! But Who Am I? Hi! I'm Lisa Clark and I help nonprofits and fundraisers like YOU raise money through events so you can meet your annual revenue goals! I'm also the host of a free Facebook Group, Raising with Lisa Clark, a free group for fundraisers, NPOs, development team members, volunteers, and supporters. I included a link below so you can request to join right away! \xa0 Link to Join Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/112148672944584 How Much Beer, Wine, and Liquor Do I Need? This is something that boggles the minds of a lot of people, but having a rough estimate of the amount of alcohol that you should buy for your event can help save you money! Here are a few tips:  You can base it on per hour, per person, or 2.5 drinks per person per event. If you’re talking wine, then just remember that there are around 4.5 to 5 glasses per bottle if you are filling up glasses with 4 to 5 ounces. \xa0 Beer kegs are another option. If you’re filling glasses with around 12 ounces, there are almost 2,000 ounces of beer per keg. This equals around 165 people per keg. A standard bottle of liquor that is around 80 proof contains approximately 25 ounces per bottle. If you do 1.5 ounces per shot that is around 17 drinks. One pound of ice per person and don’t forget weather can play a role so if it’s hot, you’ll need more ice and more white wine then red wine Offer mocktails to those that don’t drink  You may need to adjust this estimate since you know your attendees better than any one, but it’s a good start when starting the process of ordering alcohol. You also need to inform your bartenders the amount of alcohol to serve depending on the type. If you don’t, then they will most likely free-pour and your estimates will be off. Also negotiate to purchase liquor by the bottle rather than by the drink. It will be cheaper in the long run to buy the liquor for 20 to 25 drinks in one bottle rather than paying per drink - just like buying a keg of beer is cheaper per glass than buying individual bottles or cans. Agree up front with the catering manager on a system for auditing the used and unused bottles of liquor before and after the event. \xa0 Coffee, Tea, Soda, and Water The amount that people are going to drink depends on their environment and time of day! Here’s a breakdown of what that looks like:  Average consumption of beverages in the morning will be roughly 65 percent hot (coffee and tea) and 35 percent cold (juice, iced tea, and soda). In the afternoon, beverage consumption will average about 65 percent cold and 35 percent hot. In the evening, this ratio changes if you have alcohol available since most people will head for the bar. Coffee and hot water for tea are purchased by the gallon, which equals about 128 ounces and produces roughly 20 6-ounce cups.  Final thoughts on beverages, if that when ordering you need to take into account the time of day, weather, type of event, and the attendees into consideration. My tips are just here to help you guide you through this thinking process so that you order enough for your event! There’s nothing worse than the feeling that you’re running out of beverages while you’re already in the middle of trying to make sure the rest of your fundraising event is running smoothly! Cash Bar vs Open Bar It’s true that people drink less at a Cash Bar so you’ll have to plan for 1.5 drinks per person per hour. When you have an Open Bar the drinking ration goes up to around 2 to 2.5 drinks per person per hour. Makes sense right? While a cash bar might seem like a more cost-effective option for event planners since attendees are purchasing their own drinks, keep in mind that you are still responsible for the cost of the bar setup, any necessary labor, and the bartender (and possibly a bar-back helper). Always Have A Vegetarian and Gluten-Free Option Look, there are a lot of different diet preferences out there in the world. It’s hard to cater to everyone but having at least one vegetarian/vegan and gluten free option is standard. You want for people to not have to worry that they won’t be able to eat at your event! Hungry people aren’t necessarily happy people! Don’t have this be an afterthought. Be intentional with the choice that you make. And be sure to label your foods to designate what dietary needs! It can be as simple as:  GF- Gluten-free DF- Dairy Free VG - Vegetarian VEG- Vegan NF - Nut Free  Sure, this doesn’t cover all of the allergies and dietary needs out there, but having a few simple options shows you care. This goes a long way with donors. You could even have the option for people to let you know if they need special accommodations with a food oriented email that lets people know what the menu is and a contact button just in case. This way your staff can be informed and a dish can be made for someone that needs that accomodation. Appetizers Some of your events will only be serving appetizers which is completely fine! Finger food can go a long way. But one thing I want to mention when it comes to appetizers is that you should only make them in one to two bite portions. I’m mentioning this since some events don’t have seating arrangements as part of the plan. People don’t want to be walking around with food the whole time! Make them quick munchies that can then be disposed of so that its convenient! Theatre Setups I’m currently planning an event that has theatre style seating. If you’re in the same boat, plan for 8 square feet per person if no AV presentation is involved. If AV will be used, increase the space to 10 square feet per person. Theater setups allow you to pack the most people into the smallest space, and are fine if attendees won't be taking a lot of notes and sessions are short. Classroom Setups Allot 12 square feet per person if you want three people per 6-foot table, or 18 square feet for two people per 6-foot table, allowing 44 inches between each row of tables. For classroom configurations with AV, plan a minimum of 15 square feet per person. Classroom setups are better for serious training sessions or when people need room to take notes. Banquet and Reception Banquets and most receptions with a bar (or multiple bars) and standard buffet tables require 10 to 12 square feet per person. Banquet rounds are best for in-depth, small-group discussions, and they allow for quick room reset for food functions. In my experience 66-inch round tables seat 8 people nicely. 72-inch round tables can fit ten! You can fit 12 people at these, but you need to consider your audience. One time I hosted an event for footballers and there was no way that I could have fit 12-people at the tables. \xa0 Calculating Ticket Prices There are a lot of formulas out there on the internet so you definitely can use what works best for you. However this is what I have found to be the most useful solution to this dilemma. To determine your event's registration fee (RF), divide your fixed costs (FC) by the number of anticipated attendees (AA) and add your variable costs per person (VC/P). \xa0 Example: If the fixed cost for your event is $200,000, the variable cost per person is $500, and you anticipate 1,000 attendees, the registration fee should be $700. \xa0 The formula is:  (FC/AA) + (VC/P) = RF (200,000 / 1,000) + $500 = $700  \xa0 What Are Your Tips? I’d love to hear what advice you would give to other individuals that are planning events! We all learn from different experiences so I’d love to hear your perspective. I really hope that this helps to answer some of your questions when it comes to planning a successful event. These kinds of things can seem mundane, but they can save you money and help you to run a smoother event with no last minutes runs to the grocery or liquor store. I wish you luck and success with you upcoming events! | So, you have the auction all planned. You’ve followed the steps in my last blog post “The Live Auction Blueprint” and now you’re just worried about getting people in the door. Now, this isn’t going to be a quick process. You’re going to want to start marketing you advance around six months in advance, but I promise you’ll see that it’s worth it when you have tons of people attending your fundraising event. But Who Am I? Hi! I'm Lisa Clark and I help nonprofits and fundraisers like YOU raise money through events so you can meet your annual revenue goals! I'm also the host of a free Facebook Group, Raising with Lisa Clark, a free group for fundraisers, NPOs, development team members, volunteers, and supporters. I included a link below so you can request to join right away! \xa0 Link to Join Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/112148672944584 \xa0 Save the Date You want to get it out there on your social media, email, in-person, and any other platform you can think of, the date of your event. Whether it’s a Google Calendar link, or a flyer, you want to motivate people to put it on their calendar. Even make a Facebook or Meetup event so that people can RSVP and get alerted about your event on their phone. Eventbrite is another great resource for this but you might want to research what event platforms are more successful in your area. Auction Items Now, I know your event is going to be fantastic and you should let people know that, but what about your auction items? Are you using those as part of your marketing plan? How are you announcing to your people? Do they know what is up for auction? A mystery is fun and all, but you’re missing out on attendees by not marketing your items. Sending out email blasts letting people know about those amazing auction items will only intrigue them more. It gets people thinking “Wow, that would be a great vacation or item for my family” and they’ll want to show up. Update your social media and your email list as you secure auction items. Write a blurb about the item to let them know what they’re signing up for. I promise you’ll get people excited this way. Proxy Bidding System You may have people that want to buy your items but they won’t be able to attend your event. This is when a proxy bidding system will be put into place. This is when people can’t attend and someone stand in their place to bid on the item they are vying for. This happens all the time so there’s no shame in this game! Let people know this is an option so that they can still support you even if they aren’t there. Survey Says At some point during your marketing, you’ll want to create a survey to segment your email list. This quick survey will help you to identify what kind of person they are. You want to know who wants what kind of content they will appreciate the most and what kinds of events they’ll attend. The more you get to know about your email list the more you know about your email list the better your marketing can become. Marketing is all about knowing your audience and this is a great way to do so. Throughout this process, you’re going to want to let people know how they can get involved, what your organization is accomplishing. Cause let’s be honest, you do great work! And I want to see you succeed in this. If you have any questions don’t be afraid to let me know! \xa0 \xa0 Don't forget to connect with me on other social media platforms as well!

We might expect that now with the media covering young leaders like Greta Thunberg and others from organizations like Fridays For Future, Sunrise or Extinction Rebellion we are closer to a government doing the right decisions.When in fact we really aren\'t. We might be on the track to get there and we might also be closer than ever before...But especially when Andreas Kuhlmann shared his experience when he attended the Earth Day which happened in June 1992 the issue got clear.We have seen that before.
