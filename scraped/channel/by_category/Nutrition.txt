This one speaks to what I was saying about cattle developing "acidosis" - where their rumen can\'t keep up with feed concentrates (grains et. al.).

The antibiotics are directly in their feed. \xa0 The ubiquitousness of bloat and acidosis in grain fed cattle. There are literally tens of thousands of studies on how to control this. When cattle come off grass and go into the feedlots, there is a transition\xa0period of moving their guts from grass fermentation chamber to a grain based one. This is done with great precision or they will bloat and die. Imagine!

What moves you in one direction or another is extremely personal. One person’s food medicine is another person’s food trigger. Some of the topics covered:  Why inflammation plagues so many people and how to create awareness to rectify this issue How to identify the most reactive areas in your body (from the brain and nervous system to the musculoskeletal system) What lifestyle changes you can make to mitigate the effects of inflammation How to design your new, personalized food and lifestyle plan to augment your wellness Why eliminating foods is freeing and helps you recognize what feeds your mind and body  Dr. Will Cole, leading functional-medicine expert, consults people around the world via webcam at www.drwillcole.com and locally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He specializes in clinically investigating underlying factors of chronic disease and customizing health programs for thyroid issues, autoimmune conditions, hormonal dysfunctions, digestive disorders, and brain problems. Dr. Cole was named one of the top fifty functional-medicine and integrative doctors in the nation and is a health expert for mindbodygreen and goop. Dr. Cole is the author of the upcoming book, The Inflammation Spectrum in which he explores how inflammation exists on a spectrum within the body, the various systems it can affect, and how you can discover your individual food triggers to overcome chronic inflammation. He is also the author of Ketotarian in which he melds the powerful benefits of a ketogenic diet with a plant-based one. \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 FREE DOWNLOAD: Get Your Free e-Book on starting keto:\xa0https://www.ketogenicgirl.com/pages/free-ebook \xa0 Try the 28 Day Ketogenic Girl Challenge:\xa0https://www.ketogenicgirl.com Special thank you to Fast Keto sponsors: Four Sigmatic:\xa0Try the Lion\'s Mane Coffee for yourself!

A goal is short term but a declaration informs everything we do in our lives. One of the major components to this is creating an environment for success.

Author and mom of four Laura Vanderkam has an answer. Track your time. Laura believes that the awareness that comes with time use tracking helps you find the correct narratives about your life rather than defeatist narratives you may have. For example, the fears “if I work full time I’ll never see my family” or self care “I’m tired so I never get enough sleep.” In Body Kindness we know that our thoughts can get the best of our emotional well being and lead to downward spirals. Laura wants you to see that these thoughts aren’t necessarily true or helpful. You can adopt a “good enough” viewpoint with time use and allow the information to help you change how you spend your time where it really matters to your values. In this episode we discuss the intersections of mindfulness and time use. How you can tend to your time like you would tend to a garden and capture a sense of agency over controllable aspects of your time rather than time passing without even noticing where it goes.

You may know her best as the creator of the Born To Eat® approach and co-author of the award-winning book, Born To Eat. For context our kids were 3 and 4 at the time, and even then we dealt with issues around people policing their food.

And how do you set boundaries at school friends when you’re concerned about hurting others feelings? What if we all took a bold and brave step to eradicate diet culture?

But how do you approach eating if you never want to diet again? By now you probably heard of intuitive eating, but do you see yourself eating intuitively and feeling happier about your relationship to food? The co-creator of Intuitive Eating, Evelyn Tribole, MS, RD wants people to understand what intuitive eating is and is NOT. One big NOT… intuitive eating is not a diet or weight loss plan (though it has been co-opted as such “lose weight with intuitive eating!” (NOPE! Run far and fast from that if you see it advertised.)

We swap client stories of struggles and how we have helped them overcome their challenges. We dig into the research a bit to show the positive, life-enhancing benefits of ditching diets for intuitive eating. We also touch on diet culture and body oppression, especially of fat bodies that get “concern trolled” so often by society…. “Oh, you really DO need to lose weight…. for health.” Nope. We believe intuitive eating is for everybody. Tune in and take action on your freedom from diets.

What if we all were fat activists? It’s an interesting thought for people who are finally at the place of rejecting diets and a singular (thin) standard for beauty and health. Activism is not always getting angry and standing on the street with a sign screaming. Sometimes it IS that, but there are lots of forms of “activism” if you take a broader definition. You can throw a pool party and rock your swimwear. You can tell the nurse, “I don’t step on the scale.” You can tell yourself “I am on your side” and anyone who treats you badly based on weight can get the push back. Fat activism is just as much about practicing self-care and self-compassion as it is about getting angry. Tune in to hear my conversation with long-time Fat Activist and author of Fat!So? Marilyn Wann joins me to discuss why it’s wrong when people say “you should lose weight for health reasons”. She shares ideas for fat activism that go beyond getting angry and protesting in the streets to include meaningful choices anyone can make to reject body oppression and instead, practice self-care.

The medical community upholds weight stigma and harms the very people they should be helping by weighing patients without informed consent, blaming weight on non weight related concerns like earaches and wrist pain, and recommending weight loss based on the unscientific BMI measurement. Medicine must work from the inside out to eradicate the problems they have perpetuated. Dr. Jennifer Gaudiani author of the book Sick Enough has made weight inclusive medical care a priority at her Denver based telemedicine clinic and she shares her ideas for why doctors must act to eradicate weight stigma on this episode. --- About Dr Gaudiani Jennifer L.

Hey Jimmy and Will,\xa0 I recently joined in on Jimmy’s 7-day fasting challenge on Instagram and they were so incredibly helpful. I was really hoping that would be a reset for me and a springboard into eating clean keto. I’ve been struggling for years with on again off again low-carb eating, but I just have super intense carb cravings. I ended up going through my time of the month and struggling through that last day of the fast and then crashed and burned back into eating tons of carbage afterwards. I caught your emotional eating JIMMY RANTS episode and I just need some help with figuring out how to conquer the craving insanity that I just can’t always willpower through. I want to be successful once and for all, but I’m feeling like a failure here, yo-yoing at very high weights, with Type 2 diabetes. I know that the answer to this lies within eating a keto template and I’m not afraid to put in the hard work to make it happen. But I definitely feel controlled by food.\xa0 I refuse to believe that I have to have a dangerous weight loss surgery to conquer this problem, but I’ve been winning some battles but losing the war for years. What do you recommend for the obsessive, overwhelming cravings, and persistent thoughts about food? How do I get actual control over this? Thanks so much, Rhonda If cholesterol isn’t a bad thing, then why did keto lead to these permanent deposits of cholesterol underneath my eyelids?  Hey Jimmy and Dr. Cole, Thanks for this podcast. I started reading Jimmy’s book Cholesterol Clarity recently because I developed these yellow bumpy lines under my eyes and was told it’s because I have high cholesterol.\xa0 I went to the doctor and immediately they wanted to put me on statins. I hate going to the because of this kinda thing. They didn’t even go over the results with me. They had the front desk call me and tell me I had a high cholesterol number and that there was a prescription for statins waiting for me at the pharmacy.\xa0 I didn’t take them, of course, and I retested after a three-month, 30l-pound keto weight loss and it was even higher. The doctor again insisted I take a statin and I again refused.\xa0 My question for you guys is if cholesterol isn’t bad, then why do these permanent deposits of cholesterol end up on my face? They look horrible and I’m told they will never go away on their own. How and why does this happen? I wanted to show you these yellow things on my face and I wondered if you had any knowledge about them. Thank you for answering my question. Louise Would a genetic liver cirrhosis condition be hindered or helped by eating a low-carb, high-fat, ketogenic diet?  Greetings Jimmy and Will, My boyfriend was recently diagnosed with liver cirrhosis which developed as en effect of a genetic disorder he was not aware of. He’s never been much a drinker and he definitely doesn’t drink now. He works out regularly and eats somewhat “healthy” according to his doctors. He’s in great shape especially for someone with only 20% liver function. I read somewhere that a hepatic diet is made up of primarily carbs since protein breakdown is impaired and fat is bad for the liver. I by no means consider myself an expert on nutrition and metabolism, but this sounds like total BS to me. It doesn’t make sense to feed your liver carbs which turn into sugar. In my mind, it just makes sense that a keto diet is the way to go in conjunction with coffee enemas perhaps. What do you think? I want to learn and do as much as I can to help my boyfriend have the best life and the best health possible.\xa0 Thank you, Brenda Why do I have bloating when I eat keto foods? Why won’t my Ketonix breath ketone analyzer show the presence of ketosis with anything I do?  Hi Jimmy and Dr. Cole, I love your show and never miss an episode because it really helps keep me on track. I’m a 31-year old breastfeeding female and have been eating keto since January 2017. When I transitioned to keto, I had already been breastfeeding my daughter for 10 months and I was starting to struggle with weight gain and hunger that was much worse than when I was pregnant. I ate whole organic foods and took probiotics for years but still consumed far too much sugar (honey, coconut sugar, and grains) and I knew I had to make a change when I started gaining more weight than I ever had in my life and having an insatiable appetite for sugar.\xa0 My transition was rough and I had keto flu and lightheadedness for weeks despite consuming plenty of water, salt loading, and taking a multimineral supplement. Urine test strips at the time showed that my ketones were off the charts high. At the beginning of my pregnancy my hemoglobin A1C was prediabetic, but after a few months on keto it was down to normal. My fasting blood sugar in the morning is now 83, and it drops to 76 after my 25 minute beginner’s strength training workout and 59 two hours after my usual breakfast of scrambled eggs. In the evening, 2 hours after dinner, it is around 80. I lost about 30 pounds in the first months and my milk supply never dropped (I’m still breastfeeding now, almost a year on keto later, with no problems.)\xa0 I love the ketogenic way of eating and am so thankful to be off carbs, but I have two main concerns: the first one is constant bloating. When I still ate carbs I had stomach pain every morning that improved after eating breakfast. Now that I’m keto I tend to feel very bloated after meals. I eat dairy and nuts, but temporarily cutting them out of my diet and it doesn’t seem to make a difference. Sometimes my worst bloating is after eating something like riced cauliflower with bacon. It seems like everything sits in my stomach too long. And I really can’t handle seltzer water! I once had a UGI endoscopy in my stomach for the stomach pain years ago and it showed everything normal except for low stomach acid. Could that be the problem? How do I increase stomach acid? I also sometimes have nausea and an acid taste, like reflux symptoms, although I’ve never had heartburn.\xa0 My other concern is with testing my ketones. I use the Ketonix breath analyzer and no matter what I do, I blow green. If I have a glass of dry champagne the night before and keto treats full of almond flour and cheese, I blow green the next day. If I intermittent fast for three days and eat very strict keto, I still blow green! How is this possible? Am I truly in ketosis? Thank you so much for your help! Rachel KETO TALK MAILBOX:  Paid advertisement  Would the inevitable diabetic neuropathy be rectified more effectively with IF and keto than with Gabapentin?  Hey guys, My boyfriend’s mother was just diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, she suffers from horrible neuropathy and finds it very\xa0difficult to sleep at night which is very common. I have read on the Internet that people with neuropathy most of the time are prescribed a drug called Gabapentin. To my surprise, they are also prescribes to patients as antidepressants. The more I think about it, long-term use of these drugs has to be very difficult on the kidneys and liver which is a double whammy for diabetics who already have issues with both of these organs. To me, it seems intermittent fasting and keto can help solve this neuropathy without the need for any risky medications. In your functional medicine practice, Dr. Cole, have you found this to be true in your patients? Sincerely,\xa0 Emi\xa0 |   We’re back for another info-packed episode of Keto Talk!

Hey Jimmy and Will, I am a natural bodybuilder and have been for over 40 years now. For the past decade, I’ve consume a 100% grass-fed and non-GMO organic diet. In fact I was Paleo before I even knew what that was. In 2017 I started on keto and it was an easy move over from Paleo. I got into a state of nutritional ketosis very quickly with blood sugar in the 80’s and blood ketones between 1-2. My blood pressure improved to 110/75 and fasting insulin down to 3.8. I felt great and had no medical issues whatsoever. But then I noticed something pop up out of nowhere last year where I developed edema in my calves, ankles, and feet. I tried upping my magnesium, drinking more water, taking in substantially more sodium, moderating my protein, and doing an 18/6 intermittent fasting schedule. None of it has worked. I weigh\xa0150\xa0pounds have have 9% body fat. Do you have any further suggestions I can do to help with this? What is it about going keto that perhaps let to this condition? Warmest regards,\xa0 Joe – Why have I developed several upper respiratory infections ever since I started keto when I’ve never been sick like this in my life?  Hi Jimmy and Will. Thank you for what you guys do for everyone in the keto community. I only just found this podcast this year and have binged listened to almost all of them. I am a registered nurse and have taking care of the sickest of the sick in the city of Pittsburgh. I now work normal M-F hours with low stress.\xa0 I’m on Synthroid for Hashimoto’s hypothyroidism, but my immune system has been so stellar I’ve hardly ever gotten sick. But ever since starting on keto, I’ve had three upper respiratory infections eating this way. While I’ve lost 20 pounds, have great brain health, increased my energy, and spontaneously intermittent fast for 16 hours at a time while stabilizing my blood sugar and increasing my blood ketone levels, these respiratory issues are discouraging and throwing me for a loop. I’m assuming it’s a gut health thing that needs to be healed from years of neglect before starting keto. How do I provide a boost to my immune health to prevent another infection from developing?\xa0 Thanks for your help, Rosslyn\xa0 – How do I manage my cravings to consume way too many calories on keto because of my pituitary microadenoma condition?  Hi Jimmy and Dr. Cole,\xa0 I’ve been on a weight loss journey for about a year, and went keto 6 months ago. Before keto, I lost over 15 pounds, then switched to keto to optimize my athletic performance and brain function while continuing to lose weight. I also wanted to try to heal my hormones with a low-carb, high-fat diet. I have a pituitary microadenoma which is essentially a small tumor on my pituitary gland that secretes high levels of prolactin. These high levels of prolactin suppress estrogen production. In short, it means I have high prolactin, low estrogen, and have not had a period in 2 years which ultimately is leading to infertility.\xa0 I am wondering if this hormone imbalance could be suppressing my weight loss and/or increasing my hunger and questioning whether keto would be a useful tool to balance my hormones. I haven’t lost any weight since beginning on keto and I still struggle with food addiction/binge eating. Unlike what other people report eating a ketogenic diet, I don’t really get full or reach satiety until I’ve consumed way too many calories. I know calories aren’t what they’ve been made out to be, but they do have to count because they’ll get stored as body fat if consumed in excess, right? Got any tips for me? Thanks guys and keto on! Kayla from Canada – What can I do about the swelling in my ankles and lower legs that started happening after I went keto?  Hi guys,\xa0 I love your podcast! I’ve been keto for over a month and have been testing for blood ketones. I’m doing well but I have been retaining water in my ankles and lower legs. I get leg/shin cramps at night so I have been adding a magnesium/potassium supplement to help. They have eased up quite a bit but the swelling has increased. Ketones are still strong, but my weight loss stalled out after losing eight pounds. I had a total hysterectomy at 35 years old with no hormone replacement therapy and I’m 56 now. Any suggestions on what to try next?\xa0 Thank you for your help, Dede\xa0  Paid advertisement  KETO TALK MAILBOX: – Why does my blood pressure and heart rate shoot way up when I am eating very low-carb keto and engaging in periods of fasting?  Hey Jimmy and Dr. Cole, I’m listening to an older episode where a woman had asked about cortisol and low-carb. I haven’t taken a test for it yet, but when I fast, long-term or intermittent, and consume a very low-carb diet (under 20), my blood pressure shoots through the roof and I get major heart palpitations. When this happens, I purposely knock myself out of ketosis and my heart rate and blood pressure normalize again. I’ve been keto for four months and I’m not really losing any weight yet. I’ve felt pretty good eating this way, but I have noticed being a bit more tired than normal at times. I take all the recommended electrolyte supplements and plenty of water and salt. So what am I doing wrong? Thank you, Lisa | After being gone for several weeks as Jimmy and Will have dealt with the busyness that comes with summer, we’re back for a couple of months before Jimmy heads off for his much deserved six-month sabbatical (more on this coming up).

Hey guys, My question is about my mom who is in her 60s and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes a few years ago. Her diabetic nurse jokes she is a Type 1.5 because her pancreas is not producing much insulin. She eats a low-carb diet but still has trouble controlling her blood sugar. It’s not out of control but higher than ideal. She says there doesn’t seem to be any discernible pattern to it.\xa0 Her diabetic nurse has her on a consistent low dose of insulin daily. At her last check-up she was spilling a little protein into her urine. I encourage her to try eating less veggies to lower carb count because she eats tons of them. But she does eat lots of eggs, cheese, and nuts. I think those are her main staples apart from the veggies. She eats healthy fats but maybe not enough of them and some berries as well.\xa0 I know she’s not a big fan of eating meat—no pork or chicken. She used to drink a glass of wine at night but I think she’s cut back on that. She tried fasting but it didn’t agree with her. I’m now wondering if she’s fat-adapted. She says sometimes she is lightheaded in the morning which makes me think her blood sugar or blood pressure is low at that time. Or maybe she needs more electrolytes like salt. I’m wondering if because her pancreas doesn’t work well whether fasting or low-carb/keto are still a good treatment protocol.\xa0 Any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated as she gets frustrated and scared and I don’t know what else to suggest. Thanks for taking the time to read this! \xa0 Nicole – Will eating a ketogenic diet cause the condition Myasthenia Gravis to become worse? Hey Keto Talk dudes, My ears perked up when I heard Jimmy mention that his mom suffers with Myasthenia Gravis (MG) in a recent episode. I have been searching for MG and keto information, but there doesn’t seem to be much connection with them. I had been low-carb off and on for years, but this past January decided to try a more strict keto plan to “clean up” after an indulgent holiday season. Within a week I woke up with an odd drooping eyelid and a few days later started suffering from intermittent but terrible double vision. After several visits to the eye doctor and a neuroopthalmologist that included an expensive MRI and inconclusive blood tests plus other weird symptoms of intermittent but profound weakness in my legs and neck, he thought I had MG. Of course, he blamed keto for bringing it on. But now he’s got me wondering if keto is doing more harm than good with this condition. I’m willing to take any supplements or do other strategies to help with this so I can stay on my keto diet. Thanks for helping me with this, \xa0 Louise – Where can you turn to find quality information and professional support for treating cancer with a ketogenic approach? Hey Jimmy and Dr. Cole, I have been doing a ketogenic/LCHF diet for three years on my own after reading Keto Clarity and listening to your podcast. Now my mother has been diagnosed with lung cancer and her functional medicine doctor is encouraging her to begin keto. I know there is a difference between what I am doing and what is necessary for therapeutic levels of ketosis for something like cancer. My question is where can we find information on or get guidance from someone who can guide her through starting this diet correctly? Every cancer center has dieticians available, but none of them know anything about keto or fasting or anything remotely useful other than “drink Ensure” “don’t lose weight” “eat plenty of calories” etc. Where do you find someone with real knowledge? Lee – How can I control the major carb cravings that overcome me during my time of the month? Hi Jimmy and Will,\xa0 I started listening to your podcast in the Fall and began seeing a Naturopath which has changed my life! I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and started taking supplements to balance my hormones and heavy painful periods. I began taking desiccated thyroid about a month ago and it has made a huge difference to my energy and mood levels. I have not eaten sugar in over 6 weeks which I have found to be very helpful in balancing my hormones and moods. My periods are not as heavy but still very heavy and I struggle with major carbohydrate cravings right before my period starts. I usually end up caving in and eating pizza or something very carby then feeling terrible the next day. Any helpful suggestions for managing this? Do I need to up my fat or protein intake around this time of the month?\xa0 Thank you very much,\xa0 \xa0 Christine\xa0 KETO TALK MAILBOX: – How can I effectively balance my testosterone levels as a woman without resorting to a hysterectomy or oral contraceptives? Hi Jimmy & Will, I could use some ideas from you about balancing testosterone. I am 36 years old, have been keto for almost a year, and dropped 35 pounds effortlessly. I have PCOS and stopped taking oral contraceptives after 20 years of use. I cannot tell you how much better I feel off of them. However, my testosterone levels are now quite high. I have used the at home Everlywell hormone testing and it measured at 159ng/dl (normal 16-55). The hair on top of my head is very thin, my cycles are unpredictable with a lot of mid-cycle spotting, and I have painful large zits on my face, neck, and chest. I found an article on PubMed referencing licorice root as an aid to lower testosterone in women. So I started taking a conservative dose to start (1g, recommended was 3.5g). What else can I do to help this? When I went to my OBGYN with my concerns, his options were to have a total hysterectomy so I don’t have to deal with periods, get back on oral contraceptives, or an IUD. The only lab work he wanted to run was a CBC to make sure I wasn’t anemic from all the bleeding.\xa0 I have made so much progress with keto so far eliminating pain from the cysts and getting my blood sugar and weight under control that I refuse to believe I have to take hormones to make this better. The only other lab markers that were off was my end of day cortisol at 3.4ng/ml (n=0.4-1.0), and my progesterone:estradiol ratio at 49 (n=100-500). My estrogen was previously low so I started supplementing with a phytoestrogen. I think stopping that will bring this ratio back down. I am reluctant to spend my time going to another MD if those are my options.

Hey guys, I have been doing\xa0keto\xa0religiously for the last six weeks and I already love it! I lost eight pounds pretty quickly and then it slowed down dramatically ever since.

Hi Jimmy and Will,\xa0 Ever since going\xa0keto\xa0I’ve developed a case of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)—no real heartburn, just throat burning, trouble breathing, coughing, ear ache, stuffy nose, etc. I’m convinced all these symptoms are a result of the high-fat intake on my\xa0ketogenic diet. A number of people online have been reporting similar symptoms after starting on nutritional\xa0ketosis and seeing it resolve after going off of it. I’ve even seen my dad who had this same condition and doesn’t eat\xa0keto\xa0have problems, too, because of the fat he eats in his diet. So what do I do?

Hi Jimmy and Dr. Cole, I recently discovered the\xa0Keto\xa0Talk\xa0podcast in January and I’m really loving it so far. I have been experimenting with a\xa0keto\xa0diet for managing trigeminal/occipital neuralgia that gives me nearly constant migraines all the time. I had nerve decompression surgery last year and while it has helped, it’s still not as much as we’d hoped it would be. I’m hearing a lot of people in the migraine community say they have eliminated their migraines completely with\xa0keto\xa0nutrition. My doctor are completely skeptical about that and they keep saying I’ll see little to no effect from changing my diet. The ironic part is the daily medicines that I am taking to manage this—Lyrica, Vimpat, Metroprolol and the emergency pain medicines Trammadol, OxyContin, and a clonidine tablet for high blood pressure negatively impacts my metabolism enough that it makes someone like me trying to get into\xa0ketosis that much harder. What do you think about this and how I should proceed? Thank you for all you do, I appreciate your show and I have learned so much listening.

Hi Jimmy and Dr Cole, I love you two SO SO much! I never miss an episode. Dr Cole worked with my mother and completely changed her life! My question for you guys is about Meniere’s disease and\xa0keto. I was recently diagnosed with this and I have had tinnitus ever since I can remember. Two and a half months ago, the ringing suddenly got really loud nearly overpowering all the other noises surrounding me. Needless to say, my sleep quality dropped and after seeing an ENT, Chiropractor, Audiologist, an Acupuncturist, and even an Atlas Orthogonal, I am spiraling out of control, exhausted, and not knowing where to turn. My general practitioner told me I had to change my diet from\xa0keto\xa0to eating more FRUITS, VEGETABLES, and WHOLE GRAINS. He also said I had to lower my salt significantly. Honestly I would do anything at this point to make it go away, but I can’t with good conscious and two other autoimmune diseases (Interstitial Cystitis and Reynauds) switch to a high-carb, low salt diet. I tried to explain to my doctor that on\xa0keto\xa0that it was necessary for electrolytes.

The different kinds of organ meats that you can eat include:  Brain Heart Liver Kidney Tongue Gizzard Sweetbread  History Of Organ Meats Each culture has their own opinion of organ meat and each views it slightly different than the next. In some cultures, organs are consumed daily while in others certain organs are illegal to eat. One thing that stands true for all cultures is that organ consumption has changed over the years.Centuries ago, not only were organ meats just eaten, they were praised and loved. When food was hunted and gathered there was a lot of effort put into supplying it for families and tribes. Hunters didn’t just walk to the local supermarket to buy meat, they had to fight for it. And when you’re putting that much effort into hunting food for your family, you use every ounce of it that you can. Not only was it eaten just so it wouldn’t go to waste, the organ meat was reserved for the respected society members. Whether it was the political kings and leaders, the hunters, or the elders; the organ meats were regarded as the best and saved for the best. Over the years it has changed to be eaten by all, not just the well respected, in almost all countries. In some countries, organ meats are served as common street food and others as appetizers and entrees in expensive restaurants. No matter how common throughout the world though, eating organ meat isn’t a widely loved meat here in the United States, yet. Why People Avoid It I will admit that the taste can take some getting used to, but they provide far too many benefits to avoid it. Another reason that organ meats invoke negative perceptions is the thought of toxins. The misconception in our society is that the animals’ toxins are stored in their organs; and when eaten, the toxins now move into our bodies. This would make sense, however the toxins are not actually stored in an animal’s organs. The organs, the liver in particular, are where the toxins move to get filtered out. Once there, the liver doesn’t store it, but rather decide where it should be moved to. Most times, the liver moves any toxins to the kidneys where it is then expelled through urine. The toxins are removed from the animal’s organs and bodies before it has the chance to enter our bodies. Benefits The benefits of eating organ meat reach far and wide. Each one acts as a superfood that provides many more nutrients to our bodies than the animal muscle meat that we normally eat. 1. CoQ10 One of the main nutrients that organ meats offer is the Coenzyme Q10, otherwise known as CoQ10. This coenzyme is found in the largest amounts in animal hearts. Like all coenzymes, our bodies naturally produce this nutrient, but only in small amounts and not enough that we need. That’s where organ meat comes in. CoQ10 is also designed to help other enzymes digest and break down food. When it comes to energy, it isn’t always the same and instead comes in many different forms. The form that our cells use is called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. But when our energy comes in the form of fat or carbohydrates that we eat, how does our body make that change to supply energy to our cells? CoQ10 is crucial for the body to begin and sustain the ATP synthesis process to continually supply our cells with energy each day. Our brain and cardiovascular systems are also impacted by this coenzyme due to its antioxidant features and its effect on oxidative stress. Although further research is needed, it is recommended to people with or at risk for cardiovascular disease to up their CoQ10 intake along with regular medications. Eating foods high in CoQ10 helps fight the backlash that come with these prescribed medications and keep blood flowing. When it comes to our brain, it has been shown that those with cognitive disorders have lower levels of CoQ10 that contribute to the issue. As potential agents are looked for to combat the cognitive decline we see on a daily basis, research suggests that CoQ10 has potential to be used medically to fight the decline. 2. Vitamin A Organ meats also offer one of the largest amounts of the antioxidant Vitamin A. When taken in supplement form Vitamin A in mass amounts can result in toxicity; but, Vitamin A present in food does not lead to any toxic results even in large amounts. When the body breaks down nutrients from food sources it can access how much our individual bodies need and expel any extra, avoiding any issues. There are two types of Vitamin A: retinol, or active Vitamin A, and beta-carotene. Active Vitamin A is present in organ meats and other animal meat in smaller quantities. This type can be broken down and used by the body right away, making it a perfect source to get this nutrient from. Beta-carotene, found in many vegetables, cannot be used by the body unless broken down and changed. Even though vegetables are great for you, they are an inefficient source of Vitamin A because of the work and stress it has on our bodies just to use it. Vitamin A can also do a lot of good when it comes to the immune system. In a recent study of children under 5 in Colombia, they came to the conclusion that increasing the childrens’ Vitamin A intake was the most effective way to protect against disease. Not only was it the most effective, it was also the least expensive way to protect the immune system in the children to ensure health. When Vitamin A is present, the mucosal barriers that become damaged by infection can regenerate and repair themselves to provide immune protection. If your body is lacking this immune-boosting vitamin, then regeneration does not occur and infections become more prevalent and can spread faster. One of the most noticeable benefits of Vitamin A is the glowing and clear skin it can lead to. Its support of cell regeneration keeps wrinkles away while the anti-inflammatory properties protect against acne and skin irritations. 3. B Vitamins Organ meats also supply us with important B Vitamins. All of the B Vitamins that are present in organ meats offer some kind of help to our cardiovascular systems. These vitamins can maintain healthy levels of cholesterol, blood pressure, blood triglycerides, and homocysteine. When all of these are at healthy levels, the risk of developing a heart or cardiovascular issue is greatly diminished. Vitamin B7, also referred to as biotin, is known for its ability to enhance beauty through the positive effects it has on hair, skin, and nails. One thing needed for radiant skin is fatty acid synthesis, and, of course, biotin aids this process and can therefore fight the effects of aging and prevent wrinkles. Biotin deficiency and thyroid problems can both lead to thinning hair and hair loss. This can be reversed and restored through incorporating more biotin into your diet. The same is true for restoring weak and thinning nails back to full health. For this reason many beauty products and beauty enhancing supplements can be found with biotin. However, biotin is not as effective when use topically compared to when it is when ingested. 3 ounces of beef liver provides 30 mg of biotin, which is the daily recommendation for adults. The B Vitamins in organ meats also aid in hormonal health and pregnancies. Folate, otherwise known as B9, is one of the most needed vitamins for mothers and babies for a healthy pregnancy. Folate supplements are often recommended by doctors, but I truly believe that when available, food medicines are the best way to get your daily dose of vitamins. Vitamin B6 can also decrease the risk of erectile dysfunction, reduce nausea related to pregnancy, and calm menstrual cycle cramps. Vitamin A for immune system calming. Vitamin A is essential for a strong immune system, and vitamin A deficiency has been linked to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. Researchers suspect the reason has to do with our dendritic cells, which send out a “red alert” at the sign of a supposed invader, to stimulate immunity, or a “calm down” message that tones down excessive and damaging immune reactivity. The “calm down” message makes use of vitamin A! Vitamin K2 for brain and spinal cord healing. One study in the Journal of Neuroimmunology found that vitamin K2 was effective at inhibiting the pro-inflammatory iNOS in the spinal cord and the brain immune system in rats that had multiple sclerosis symptoms. That suggests it could do the same for humans, but unfortunately, K2 is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies in the western diet. You can fix that with the right food medicines! Iron to replenish deficits. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is linked to many autoimmune diseases, but it isn’t clear how much of this is cause and how much is effect. One likely reason is that ferritin (stored iron) is mostly absorbed in the intestines. When absorption is compromised by inflammation and autoimmunity, iron stores can fall too low, and as you may already know, damage to the gut lining and leaky gut syndrome are considered (in functional medicine) to be preconditions for autoimmunity. Micronutrients to quell inflammation and promote optimal function. Micronutrient deficiencies – especially of selenium, magnesium, and zinc – are associated with several autoimmune diseases. That’s likely primarily due to chronic inflammation, which decreases the absorption of these vital nutrients.

Hi guys, I’m a longtime listener listener and appreciate all of the information you give so generously! I’m trying to figure out how to heal from fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome which I was diagnosed with in 2014. I have eaten an LCHF diet for many years and lost around 30kg (~66 pounds). I'm 59 years old and have been a yo-yo dieter my entire life. On low-carb, I have been much more successful in stabilizing my weight and the trend has been moving slowly in the right direction with about 22 pounds left to go. It’s such a struggle. Even still, my fasting blood glucose is 5-6 mmol/L and blood\xa0ketones are 0.5-0.9 mmol/L. I’ve been very strict in my\xa0keto\xa0diet for a while, but the aches and pain in my arms and legs from my fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue persists. The good news is my brain is a lot clearer and I’m able work again. It’s so difficult to find any doctors here in Sweden willing to run the tests I need to dig a little deeper into this. What would you suggest I do to help with my health issues? Thanks for your input. Susan from Sweden  – Why is the blood glucose response to a higher-carb meal greater since I’ve gone strict keto\xa0than it was when I was only eating low-carb?  Hey Jimmy and Will, Can you explain more about the blood glucose rebound effect that happens after eating\xa0keto\xa0for a while and then having a higher carb meal? I’ve noticed much higher blood sugar readings when I eat carbohydrates while on a\xa0ketogenic diet than I did just eating low-carb. I suppose it’s sign that my insulin resistance has gotten worse, but I can’t imagine why since I’m on\xa0keto. Granted, it is not always perfect in my\xa0keto\xa0diet and I don't track macros anymore. But my normal readings two hours postprandial might have been 130 before but now it’s 160. Good luck with your six-month sabbatical, Jimmy. And thank you for answering my question. Donna  – How can I optimize my keto\xa0lifestyle with the APAO2 gene mutation that makes it difficult to process saturated fat?  Hi Jimmy and Dr. Cole, I have been\xa0keto\xa0for a year and a half and I’ve lost 60 without taking any medications. I recently learned that I have the APAO2 gene mutation that makes it difficult for my body to process saturated fat. My doctor insists that I cut my fat intake and eat a lot of vegetables. My LDL-P is 2418 and my heart calcium score came in very high at 268. I also have high oxidized LDL. I’ve been dairy-free for a year which has helped me boost my HDL cholesterol to an all-time high of 49. I took statin medications for almost 18 years before the side effects became too much for me to bear. I’m 68 years and just want to be as optimally healthy as I can possibly be. The one bright spot is my inflammation marker hsCRP is stellar at 0.3. Should I be eating more lean proteins and increasing my intake of avocado, olives, and nuts along with eating more leafy greens?\xa0 I am considering the\xa0Ketotarian way of eating since it seems to fit my genetic needs at this time. I just hate to give up so many of the animal-based foods I enjoy. Thanks for your help, Kenneth \xa0  – Will a ketogenic diet help patients dealing with atrial fibrillation?  Hi Jimmy and Will, I just listened to your special episode with guest cohost Dr. Jay Wiles from a few weeks back where you discussed the bogus a-fib study. As someone who has this condition, I appreciated your input on that. But you guys didn’t say whether\xa0keto\xa0would help with this disease or not. My experience has been that my heart palpitations get worse eating\xa0keto\xa0and that if I backed off my thyroid medication I get relief from this. I’m not sure why, but I suspect it is the hormone regulatory effects that come from a\xa0ketogenic diet. Unfortunately, when I did this my TSH shot way up to (yes, that’s not a typo—338!), and my doctor was obviously VERY concerned. I went back on the medication for fear of not knowing what impact chronically high TSH would have on the body. (I live in Canada and doctors rarely test any of the other numbers on the thyroid panel). Can you\xa0talk\xa0more about what impact eating\xa0keto\xa0has on patients with a-fib? Thanks so much. Brenda  KETO\xa0TALK\xa0MAILBOX: – Is using senna leaf as a daily laxative to deal with opiate-induced constipation causing damage to the microbiome and general gut health?  Hey guys, I eat\xa0>keto, but have a really bad case of opiate-induced constipation which forces me to use senna leaf as a laxative on a daily basis.\xa0 I try to boost my gut health with fermented foods, probiotics, and digestive aids. But it seems I’m hopelessly addicted to taking laxatives since I can’t poop without help. This is probably a silly question, but is my microbiome suffering from this? I haven’t had a solid stool in months. So embarrassing! Thanks for helping me with this!

We get into whether to eat organic or not, what we actually eat in a day, how to save money on healthy food, thoughts on being paleo, vegan, keto, and more, intermittent fasting, if calories matter, and the best diets for weight loss. We talk about the best healthy desserts, the best healthy pastas, the one food everyone should  eliminate from their diet to be healthier and the one they should add in, the two foods everyone should eat for hormone balance, and tons more. I’ve listened to a ton of healthy eating podcasts, and I often come away feeling like I’ve learned a lot, but I have no idea what to do TODAY in order to be healthier or to solve a specific issue, and I really wanted this episode to answer those questions. You’ll come away EXCITED about healthy eating, but also really knowing what to buy at the grocery store, what to make for breakfast, how to solve your specific gut issues, and more. Rachael is a wealth of knowledge and because this is a live event you’ll hear a bit more from me as well—but you have any lingering questions about healthy eating, please ask on Instagram (@lizmoody and @rachaelsgoodeats)—maybe we’ll do a follow up episode!Enjoy!PS: Healthier Together is officially a number one best-seller!

While she has a thriving business, it’s also abundantly clear how much she’s driven by actually helping people, which is refreshing and more rare than I’d like it to be. I asked for your questions on Instagram (make sure you’re following @lizmoody to send in Qs for future guests), and you really wanted to know about how she’s built such an incredible business and life, so we talk about that a ton. McKel has amazing tips for combating burnout, minimizing stress, and still making a ton of money. We talk about her various revenue streams, what most people get wrong when they start their own company, what she credits with her phenomenal success, and more. We also talk about McKel’s own health issues, including how she beat the debilitating migraines she used to suffer from, and what she thinks are the easiest ways to make over your diet. Finally, we talk about the amazing story of how McKel manifested her husband. I’m a skeptic about manifestation, but this story GOT ME, and I’m so excited for you to hear it.

Kelly is a holistic nutritionist and wellness wonder woman, with a best-selling book, Body Love, and a client list that includes basically every A-lister in Hollywood, including Jessica Alba and Jennifer Garner. She’s also the nicest human being, a total girl next door that you’d want to hang out with on a Saturday afternoon. In this episode, we talk about Kelly’s own health journey, including how she came up with her famous “Fab Four” philosophy. I grill her on the nitty gritty of nutrition, including what types of protein powders are good for you, what supplements we should all be taking, how trendy things like celery juice and collagen fit in and more. Then, we get chatty—I asked her to spill all the dirt on what working with super famous people is actually like, and I was actually really surprised by her answers. We talk about the mega success of Body Love and why her life looks WAY different than most people expect, and we get into her relationship with her brilliant, super hot husband Chris. I’m obsessed with this episode because it’s like a dose of the best healthy eating advice you’ve ever heard mixed in with real talk about relationships, money, and life, with some celeb gossip thrown in. It’s basically my dream conversation, and I hope you love it too.You can find all of the products Kelly mentions in this episode at lizmoody.com/shop.

She’s incredibly honest, with unapologetic pictures of things like crotch sweat and arm fat, and insightful, with an ability to find the story and wisdom in everything from an interaction with an Uber driver to her unique Texas upbringing. This conversation represents some of my favorite elements of the Healthier Together podcast—a casual, frank conversation about everything from religion to anxiety to weight loss to pursuing your passion and how that should fit in with earning money. I also grilled Chinae about where she gets her incredible self-confidence, and came away with insights that have changed my life since.

Healthier Together music by Alex Ruimy. | On this special live episode of the Healthier Together podcast, recorded from the LA stop of my book tour, I sat down with two of my favorite women, Sophie Jaffe (@sophie.jaffe) and Courtney Swan (@realfoodology) to talk about “things you’re not supposed to talk about.” We all bonded over having zero filter, so this is an incredibly candid discussion about money (including how we make our money and lots of hard numbers!), sex (definitely don’t listen to this part in the car with kids!), and a super real, raw look at body image. I had a bit of a vulnerability hangover after recording this one, but the content is so good that I couldn’t not share it. I hope you feel like you’re with your most open girlfriends, breaking down the barriers of shame that have made women feel not good enough for centuries.

A fasting purist would answer with nothing but water. A more relaxed faster may point you to a cup of black coffee, tea, or bone broth. Let\'s face it: Intermittent fasting can be tough...especially for a newbie! What can one drink to help get them through a fast without "breaking" it?

If we can reset the code, can we slow, stop or even reverse aging? Sinclair believes we can. Geoffrey Woo, after digesting "Lifespan", has formulated some interesting thoughts based on the information given and hypotheses proposed in the book.

Even things like “Watching what you eat”, “just trying to eat healthier” … these ways of eating are restrictive. There is something that is trying to be avoided and limitations that you are trying to stay in.As a dieter, when you deny yourself food that you want, it creates a very unhealthy relationship with food and your body. You are signaling to your body that it’s bad and wrong to eat certain food. Your body and mind is filled with guilt and shame. You feel confined, and there is no freedom of choice…\xa0There are so many nuances when it comes to restriction but one of the biggest downfalls of restriction is almost inevitable bingeing …. No matter what you do, if you do not stop restricting, the bingeing cannot end.\xa0What you resist persists. The more we restrict, the stronger the desire to eat all the food, the more obsession you feel, and the constant thoughts about food become louder and louder.\xa0There is no way you can come from a good place when talking about restriction. Restriction doesn’t give you a choice, it doesn’t allow you to tune into your body, and it sure as heck doesn’t come from a place of love- it comes from a place of shame, guilt, and obeying the diet rules.\xa0You can’t trick yourself into restricting effectively - if you are restricting when you want something and there’s a hope of weight loss or some body change the cycle will never end.\xa0We want to share with you how you can live a life as an UnDieter, have freedom and be able to make empowered choices, and never restrict yourself.And no it doesn’t mean that you are going to be eating endless amounts of sugar (OH THE HORROR!!). Just so you know, restricting sugar (or any food) isn’t actually going to make you eat less of it - it actually does the opposite and most likely will make you eat more than you wanted in the first place and an even better chance that you’ll binge on it.\xa0So how the heck to feel good in your body, have wellness without the obsession, and not restrict food?\xa0So to start, if you are restricting (physically or mentally) the first thing to do is to stop that. We know it can feel scary but that’s the first step - it’s giving yourself unconditional permission to eat. There may be a phase where you are eating things that you haven’t in a while more often\xa0 and that’s okay!! Allow allow allow allow- we promise you will stop eating the thing- when you eat something with permission there’s an immediate shift in your brain and over time it gets easier and easier. It’s about EMPOWERED CHOICE - instead of seeing anything as restriction- it’s seeing it as a powerful choice that comes from your truth. If you know eating a lot of dairy can upset your stomach - it’s okay to choose to pass or choose to eat a smaller amount because it’s what honors your body. It’s not restricting dairy - it’s making a choice from the signals in your body with some logic - it’s about what is best for you and maybe that means eating a bunch of cheesy pizza even if that may upset your stomach. You are not right or wrong for the choices that you make. It all comes down to you and what makes you feel good in your body.\xa0Checking the intention behind the choices that you make - did you pass on the cookies even though you wanted them because you felt like they were bad or were going to make you gain weight? Or did you pass on the cookies because you just had a nice satisfying dinner and you just feel too full to eat the cookies even though they look and smell delicious? There’s a HUGE difference between passing on the cookies. The first example is restriction, the second example is honoring your body. Just calling restriction, honoring yourself doesn’t make it “loving”, the intention and internal thought process truly needs to change.Sometimes a bite is all you need (or however much) - restriction leads us to not listening to our bodies and not using our intuition. When we constantly deny dessert because we think we shouldnt be eating it every night that only leads to more obsession and most likely eating more dessert than what we would have eaten if we just allowed ourselves to have it when we first wanted it -\xa0\xa0Do you see how allowing gives you the opportunity to actually eat in a way that feels good and it doesn\'t come from a place of restriction?Not that this is the point at ALL - but not restricting can lead to eating less, solely because you are allowing yourself and listening and now coming from a place of “the last supper” or fear of not knowing when the next time you’ll be eating the thing you want\xa0 - why do you think most people eat the entire pint of ben and jerry’s in one sitting? Because they don’t know when they’ll get it again- so might as well eat it all. When restriction doesn’t exist - you may just have a few bites, or half or the whole thing doesn’t really matter but the thing is, you know you can have it tomorrow if you want so it doesn’t seem as special, therefore allowing you to eat with your body signals and not the obsessive desire to binge.\xa0It’s a mindset shift!!! It’s making choices that honor you and your body without making one choice better or worse. It’s allowing yourself to live without the diet rules and have the freedom to choose and not be guilted or shamed for eating the ice cream and chips and not praised for eating the salad and Chicken and broccoli. It’s ALL okay because that’s what you chose- end of story.\xa0So to close, restriction is what got you stuck in the diet cycle in the first place, so it absolutely won’t be the thing that sets you free.\xa0There’s a life outside restriction and that’s called wellness without the obsession which still allows you to care about feeling good and making choices that honor your wellness (and that means sometimes eating the cookies and sometimes passing on the cookies- it’s being able to have it all and knowing your self worth at the same time.)\xa0Don’t forget you can download the worksheet to help you process through this episode! www.thebodylovesociety.com/74\xa0The UnDiet Academy begins in November - you can get on the waitlist at:\xa0www.thebodylovesociety.com/undietSee you next week!\xa0 | Welcome to How to Love Your Body we are Lauren and Jenna your UnDieting coaches. On this podcast you will get weekly coaching that is straightforward and actually useable on your journey to food and body freedom.\xa0Today we are going to be talking about willpower, what it really is, why you think you don’t have enough of it and why it\'s all complete BS!There is a worksheet that goes with today’s episode that you can find at thebodylovesociety.com/73.This worksheet will help you work along with the episode so instead of just listening and nodding your head you can actually begin implementing some change in your mindset and your life.So what is willpower really?The most accurate definition we found was this: control of one\'s impulses and actions; determination; self-control.So what kind of things do we use willpower (self control, controlling our impulses) for?What dont we use it for?We use willpower when:We refrain from yelling at our childrenWe are kind to our partners when they forgot to pick up the milk AGAINWhen we focus at work instead of watching youtube videos which is what we actually want to doWhen we say no to that cookie even thought we really really want itWhen we dont get out of our car and chase after that fool that just cut you off\xa0When we dont tell our friend to quit her complaining already and just leave him…Modern society takes A LOT of self control to function well in…So when you use all that willpower up on your diet? Guess what happens….There’s none left for life.This is why we get snappy, more irritable and lash out more easily when we are restricting food, not only are we hangry but we have no willpower left in our reserves.Because willpower is a depleting thing… not like a muscle where the more you use it, the stronger it gets.\xa0So -- do we want to be using all of our willpower (which inevitably runs out and leads to binge eating/ overdoing it on the weekends) or do we want to live a smooth and happy life overall and let the food take care of itself?If willpower is a part of the way you eat… it CANNOT last a lifetime. It’s physically impossible.So what do we do instead?We drop the use of willpower all together.So just eat everything and feel horrible and let myself go? Just give up??No.It’s just taking a completely different approach that will lead you to the wellness without the obsession that you’ve been looking for all along.When you go through the entire Undieting process (more on the specifics of this coming in the next few episodes) - you find that you have an ebb and flow, a flexibility with food, you never had before.No willpower needed. But there are choices to be made.Once you’ve done the mindset work, and truly are embodying intuitive eating and the undiet way of living you just make the best choice for you in the present moment.Does right now that cookie sound amazing and your body is on board with it? Awesome enjoy!Are you stuffed from dinner and those stale cookies are staring at you from the counter? Well…you can choose to eat them or not, no right or wrong but maybe a stale, mediocre cookie when youre super full from dinner won’t feel too great.It’s about having the tools and the mindset to be able to make choices in the moment that serve you well and leave you feeling empowered and NEVER restricted.Since willpower is never used here, it never runs out. You can actually maintain this way of life for the rest of your life.So how can you start letting go of the concept of willpower around food?\xa0\xa0Recognize that you’ve always had “enough” willpower and forgive yourself for past (what you might see as) shortcomings.\xa0\xa0In your worksheet you can dive more into this (writing it down will help you create this change a lot more effectively than just listening to this will)….Identify some past instances where you beat yourself up for not having enough willpower and rewrite the story -- ACTUALLY it makes complete sense that every weekend after restricting myself and using up all my willpower I let it all go on the weekend.\xa0\xa0Figure out what you need to begin working on/ implementing in order to let go of willpower around food.\xa0\xa0What are the reasons you feel you need to have “self control” or control your impulses when it comes to food? What do you feel will happen if you let go of this ?Some examples might be: Everytime I have even 1 cookie I end up eating a whole row, or if I let myself eat pizza I would order it every night… get those worst case scenarios down on paper…\xa0Now what would need to happen for these things to stop.Likely things such as : allow all food so food is just food and it doesnt have so much power over me...Repair my relationship with my body so I don’t feel like Im always inadequate and constantly need to be on the hunt for weight loss…Stop seeing food as good or bad.. I dont feel like I would go out of control with salad, so whats that all about?These arent things you can snap your fingers and have but they will give you personal insight into what needs work so you can move forward in a productive direction. This is all about self awareness - which without, we cant move anywhere!\xa0Decide 1 step you’re going to make to more forward with this.\xa0If you feel body image is the #1 thing you want to work on so you don’t have to be using willpower around food so much, decide 1 action step you can take to get closer to at least a neutral relationship with your body. Does that mean thanking it every morning for something it does instead of the way it looks?If you want to begin allowing all food choose 1 food you are going to begin allowing yourself to eat unconditionally, yes this may result in eating quite a bit of that food at first but it won’t be that way forever.If you are sick of the baby steps, you can always have a peek at The UnDiet Academy where we lead you down the complete path to being an UnDieter - body mind and soul :)\xa0You can get more info at www.thebodylovesociety.com/undiet and if you add yourself to the waitlist you’ll be the first to get information when we open the doors in late October/ Early November, exact dates will be sent out soon to those on the list.Simply enter your email at www.thebodylovesociety.com/undiet to get that info!Send us a DM on Instagram @thebodylovesociety and tell us your stories about willpower and what you will work on to move way from having to use it with food!You can absolutely get back in the drivers seat and have an effortless and joyful relationship with food and your body - no more restrictions, limitations and willpower needed :)\xa0See you next week and dont forget to grab your willpower worksheet at www.thebodylovesociety.com/73Love, Lauren and Jenna | On this week\'s episode of How to Love Your Body we combined a very loaded question that we have gotten over the years, so we decided to put it all into one episode.We are going to be addressing:How to be an UnDieter even if you have food allergies that cause restrictions/ medical restrictions.Also touch on a question that we get often “if it’s safe to go vegan/ vegetarian without spiraling back into dieting even though there are many restrictions.” Lastly one of our listeners left us a review (thank you!) - and asked if we could touch on how to navigate food restrictions that are ethics based (and still follow IE/ UnDieting).Here\'s a worksheet you can download- "How to make sure your medical/ethical restrictions don’t become a slippery slope back into the diet mentality!"- Get it here. \xa0Before we begin- we are not licensed dietitians so anything we share is solely from our own experiences and opinions - Take what resonates, leave what doesn’t, and always, always, always consult a professional if your health is at risk or for any matter!Let’s dive in… 1. How to be an UnDieter with Food Allergies Food allergies or medical restrictions can make you feel restricted and that is the exact feeling we are trying to get away from when we UnDiet - so how do we marry the two together?First off - the mindset of CHOOSING to not partake in these foods needs to be present, if we think about it like “we can’t”, or “the doctor told me not to”, it feels like a rule that wants to be broken!When it’s your own empowered choice daily to forgo certain foods it feels a lot more peaceful, because in reality it is a choice. If a food makes you feel sick, you can choose to eat it and feel sick or you can choose to not eat it and not feel sick - honestly neither choice is right or wrong, but its your choice to make.Even for Jenna as someone with celiac disease, she can choose to eat gluten and increase her chances greatly of getting colon cancer later in life (and other complications and damage) or she can choose not to eat it.The other shift you need to make is to not associate your allergy with being “healthier” - in the diety sense of the term.We spoke to a client who was wondering if gluten free bread etc was healthier than the regular stuff -- that’s not the point (because usually it\'s not, gluten free options are often more processed with more ingredients ). If you can’t eat gluten, you aren’t eating it to try to eat “healthier” options, you’re doing it because your body doesn\'t react to it well.Let go of restriction = healthier and embrace EVERY alternative that you canCan’t eat gluten? Go out and find this!GF pizzaGF breadsGF cookiesGF cakes, pies, dessertsGF pastaJust for-going these foods all together will feel very restrictive and make you feel like you’re on a diet all over again.You can also do this with dairy free alternatives etc.Go out and find the alternative that you enjoy!2. Is it safe to go vegan/ vegetarian without spiraling back into dieting even though there are many restrictions.What’s your intention behind being vegan/ vegetarian? Is there diet culture in your intention or is it your genuine authentic choice because it serves you best? Does it have to be so black and white?We\'ve seen someone say they are “predominantly plant based” meaning they mostly eat veggie and sometimes meat- also do you have to label yourself? Can you just eat the way that feels best to you and if that’s mostly plant based then great but if one day you have meat it doesn\'t need to mean anything?The second you announce to the world or your family you are now a vegan / veggie - the pressure kicks in and you feel turmoil if you “cheat” around people you told you are vegan etc…Of course you only know what’s best for you and what honors your body / mental health- we\'d say if there isn’t a big reason (like religious/ ethic/ allergy) for being vegetarian/ vegan to not dive back into such a slippery slope of restriction (if you see it that way).We’ve seen from experience that once someone calls themselves a vegetarian or vegan they slip back into dieting feelings - we had a client who did that and it lasted for a few days before she caught herself and knew it wasn\'t good for her… Are you masking something ? Lauren did vegan and most of it was hiding disordered eating - now she loves vegan / veggie meals but she doesn\'t label herself- she eats it all!\xa0\xa03. How to navigate food restrictions that are ethics based (and still follow IE/ UnDieting)\xa0If you choose to eat / not eat certain things based on your own morals/ ethics - great. That is completely okay AND you can still be intuitive and live as an UnDieter.It’s really about shifting your mindset about WHY you are doing what you are doing - if you choose not to eat something because you don’t agree with the company - that’s not diet culture and that’s not food restriction. That is believing in something you care about and following what feels aligned with you. You are making a powerful choice with your beliefs not with diet mentality.If you don’t eat meat / eat certain things that come from an immoral company that doesn’t mean you can’t find what you want in a version that works for you- there are many meat alternatives that you can satisfy your cravings with. Be your own best advocate and find things that replace what you really enjoy in a way that works for you!As for a company - ex. If it’s a sandwich company that is owned by someone who is involved in something you are not in alignment with - you don’t ever have to eat there. PASS. That’s great. AND if you love sandwiches from this place but choose to not eat there anymore- go explore and find a new favorite sandwich place. There are options even when choosing to no eat something based on ethics.\xa0The point- you can have food allergies, you can follow your morals, you can be vegan/ vegetarian or not be vegan/ vegetarian and you can still live a life as an UnDieter. You don’t need to see anything as restriction - you see it as honoring your mind and your body. You see it as a powerful choice (and it doesn\'t always have to be the same choice, it can ebb and flow). And if there is diet mentality in there- you know it’s not about morals/ ethics/ allergies - it’s a red flag showing you that there’s some work to do underneath the surface so you can heal your relationship with food and your body and find your freedom.Don\'t forget to grab your WORKSHEET here.Talk soon!Love, Lauren and JennaPS.

Here\'s a worksheet you can download to help you with the process. http://bit.ly/tblsbadphotosWe have all had those days when you are going about your life- maybe scrolling on social media, you see a memory/ timeline share on Facebook, or you\'re going through your camera roll on your phone and BAM you see a photo that makes your stomach drop followed by lots of judgement and mean comments about yourself.You zero in on the photo and pick apart every body part that you don’t like, every squish, everything… and that may lead you into a spiral of catastrophic thinking…You start to think you need to lose weight, if you should start a diet, what you should stop eating, how you can start exercising more… it never ends.So here’s how we want to help you cope.\xa0We want to give you a 3 step process to use when dealing with bad photos Acknowledge and validate Acknowledge & validate your feelings.

What can you notice?STEP 3: Snapping yourself out of body thoughts and into your present life can bring you from judgement to gratitude- What are 2-5 things that you feel grateful for when you shifted your body image thoughts and "Zoomed Out" instead?\xa0A couple more helpful tips....Stop the urges to dive deeper into catastrophic thinking. Wanting to go compare your old pictures to how you look now? STOP! Want to take a picture of yourself in those old jeans to see how they look? STOP!Stopping yourself from getting deeper is very important. When you’re in a moment of freak out over a picture of yourself, step away and go do something else, diving in deeper will not help anything.BE GENTLE AND COMPASSIONATE WITH YOURSELF.Love, Lauren and Jenna | We want to talk about a question that comes up a lot in the UnDiet community.Is the way to UnDiet to just eat everything?Before we get started we do have a worksheet you can download that will help you get curios and figure out how to find wellness without the obsession without feeling like you need to eat EVERYTHING. Get it here.There is going to be a phase where you just ALLOW, it doesn’t need to be crazy but it definitely is part of the process after years of restriction.Your body has got to learn to trust you that you will allow yourself to eat the food you want - and that it won’t return to the restrict/ binge cycle / feeling like it’s in a famine. So consider this the “gaining trust” stage. ENJOY!Once you really get the hang of allowing all food and realizing it’s okay to eat and these foods don’t have power over you - you MAY start to feel like you’re in this place where you are okay with allowing all food but you just don’t feel too great in your body…and you don’t know how to have a balance between allowing all food and still consider nutrition/ wellness. You may be asking yourself - Do I just ALWAYS have to eat EVERYTHING now because I allow all food?The answer is NO. Here are 3 ways you can find yourself still allowing all food without feeling like you always need to eat everything…. Because as we always say- feeling good in your body matters too! \xa01. How to Consider Nutrition without it feeling like a slippery slope into dieting / restrictionWhen you choose to eat something - tune in - ask your body how it feels. What sounds good? What will honor your body?Your body is going to be firing off different signals all the time- sometimes you’ll feel very hungry and know that a bigger heartier meal is wanted. Sometimes you may feel not as hungry but know you still want to eat something. Maybe it’s just a snack you want or maybe it’s a meal?Maybe the day before, you were very hungry and your meals were filled with awesome delicious carbs and they next day your body was feeling like lighter meals? (of course you can still add carbs in any time, any day)The point is our bodies ebb and flow along the hunger spectrum and it’s our job to connect to our body and get to know our signals.\xa0If you are feeling like you haven’t eaten veggies in a while - it’s okay to purposely add more veg into your week - add it to a yummy meal and make sure to pick veggies you actually like.\xa0Just because you are choosing veggies doesn’t mean they have to taste bad! Maybe make an epic salad with a bunch of colorful fresh veggies with your favorite dressing and toppings! Maybe it’s adding veggies into a pasta dish?\xa0It can be whatever you want- it’s important to eat something you enjoy even if you are eating nutrient dense food. This doesn’t mean you are dieting- it just means you are noticing your body asking for some nutrients- it’s to feel good in your body AND enjoy what you’re eating.You can always consider nutrition and see what will feel good to you and that doesn\'t mean you have to be obsessive about getting a veggie in (or whatever it is) every meal or even everyday.\xa0It’s allowing yourself to marry nutrient dense foods and pleasurable foods and not making either of them wrong when you eat it - it’s coming from a place of tuning into your body and really having the main intention of feeling good in your body.\xa02. It’s okay to PASS or say NO (check your intention) Just because you now allow all food doesn’t mean you ALWAYS have to say yes to food (if you don’t want it- if you truly want it go right ahead!)The point here is we now have the power - we actually can choose to say yes to the dessert or no to the dessert - not because of the diet mentality - because of our own body signals and logic.If the dessert looks good but you know it wont make you feel good it’s okay to pass and take some home for later or the next day - it doesn’t mean you are dieting.It means your body just doesn’t want it. It may sound delicious and taste delicious but that doesn’t mean it will feel good.There is so much power in saying no - because now it’s about honoring your body- not giving all your power away to diet culture.There is ALWAYS a choice - you can say yes. You can say no. Just check in from where that choice is coming from- if it’s a choice based off of feeling good in your body with the mindset that all food is allowed. You can bet it’s coming from a very healthy relationship with food - and that’s amazing.\xa03. Having BOTH! You don’t ALWAYS have to eat ALL THE THINGS. Here’s a great way to help with that...Pasta may sound amazing to you- and you may say to yourself, "just a big plate of pasta won\'t feel too great so I’m going to have pasta AND lots of fresh veggies or a nice fresh salad.Maybe a pizza is going to really hit the spot but you know you’d like to add something else with that so you opt for pizza AND salad - you’ve realized when you just eat a bunch of pizza it doesn’t feel good (maybe sometimes it feels great) so you honor your body by checking in with your body while you eat the pizza and also enjoy the salad along with it.Maybe it’s a chilly night and a nice bowl of soup with a bunch of veggies sounds awesome but you know that it needs something on the side to satisfy you. You decide to add fresh bread and butter to complete the meal!And so on and so on… it can always be BOTH!\xa0Do you see by opting in for both you can feel good in your body without feeling like you are just EATING EVERYTHING and feeling like crap? You tune in - consider nutrition / what will feel good while still allowing all food both mentally and physically.\xa0REMEMBER: THIS IS NOT BLACK AND WHITE. Sometimes you’ll eat pizza without the salad and a big plate of pasta without the veggies and that’s okay!! Sometimes you’ll eat the cookie even when you’re full because they just look and smell so dang delicious.. And that’s okay!!\xa0Perfection does not exist and there isn’t one way to be an UnDieter. There are no rules or meal plans to follow. It’s really getting to know you and your body. To learn it’s signals and find trust again. To emphasize being an UnDieter doesn’t mean you just eat EVERYTHING all the time, just because it’s there. You check in with intentions, how your body feels, and you use logic - all things are considered - not a black and white rule because ultimately it’s YOUR CHOICE and when you make a choice you get to make a POWERFUL one, be okay with it and move on with life.Want to add veggies in your week - great, be intentional and powerful with that choice!Want to eat dessert - great, make that powerful choice and skip the judgement and shame.Whatever you do or how you live your life is your decision and you are not a good or bad person for the choices that you make.You live for you <3Don\'t forget to grab your WORKSHEET here.Talk soon!Love, Lauren and JennaPS.

The focus on Weight loss is the number 1 thing that women who embrace UnDieting have trouble giving up and it’s almost one of the most misunderstood topics in the UnDiet world.We have a worksheet that you can download that goes along with this episode. It will help you with how to navigate desiring weight loss AND wanting to become an UnDieter. - You can grab it here.NO. Weight loss is NOT bad, it’s also not “good”, it\'s just something that can happen. There\'s no morality tied to it.What non diet people are always harping about isn\'t that weight loss is bad, it\'s that the pursuit of weight loss is harmful both mentally and physically and most people are actively pursuing this because we were told to!!\xa0WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO PURSUE WEIGHT LOSS?Track food, calories, macrosWeighing yourself Wanting something and not eating it because you are focusing on losing weight right now (usually pursuing weight loss is short lived)You have a specific weight loss goalNot listening to your body (not eating when you\'re hungry because it doesn\'t fit into your daily allotment etc)Thinking about food WAY too oftenWhy is pursuing weight loss harmful? The reason pursuing weight loss is harmful is because it doesn’t work (even though we are told by diet culture that it absolutely does work if you have the will power and right meal plan) - you have a 2% chance of losing weight and keeping it off (probably not with ease), and a 66% chance of ending up heavier than you started. Pursing weight loss also completely disconnects you from your body, your intuition, and gives you a messed up relationship with food and your body (hello obsession, all or nothing thinking, and binge eating!)\xa0Why is it when you actually start to allow all food and not focus on weight loss you feel less “crazy”?Because your body isn’t in restriction, so it doesn’t get into primal hunger which has you obsessing over food all day, you have a clear mind and you can listen to what your body is telling you. When you give it the cookie when it asks and give it the salad when it asks - your body starts to trust you and your nervous system relaxes. Your body knows when it gives a signal it will be heard and met.\xa0That cannot happen when you only have weight loss on the brain. And we still stand behind that weight loss isn’t bad - it\'s just not very effective or necessary to focus on it so much.If you honored your cravings and body’s signals and happened to lose weight - that’s not wrong of you. Your body just happened to shift - and that also doesn’t mean you are now a worthy person.Even if you do pursue weight loss, you’re not a bad person, you’re just more likely to end up heavier than you started and develop a poor relationship with food. Actions have results and this one just doesn’t seem worth it!It’s also not wrong or bad to WANT to lose weight - you can still work on UnDieting and creating a balanced life that feels amazing without actively PURSUING weight loss even when you would like to be thinner in a perfect world.\xa0What does it look like to UnDiet even if you would still like to lose weight?Listen to your body, eating when hungry etcMaking choices based on how you want to feel instead of how you want to look (sometimes this means enjoying the dessert sometimes it means not eating it)Not weighing yourselfNo tracking, numbers etcRepairing the dieting mindset so you CAN find natural balanceNot thinking about food much until you\'re hungryFlexibility in eating, exercising etc WHILE still desiring to feel good in your bodyWe don\'t think body changes are good or bad. You can Lose weight - move on with life. Gain weight- move on with life. Stay the same- move on with life. Doesn\'t matter!If you focus on feeling good in your body and let go of the focus on weight loss- you will feel free to live your life AND you can feel amazing. This might include weight loss, it might not and both are wonderful because you are living a life with a healthy relationship with food and your body and you feel GOOD!Don\'t forget to grab your WORKSHEET here.Talk soon!Love, Jenna and LaurenPS.

We are talking about compare and despair… we’ll be sharing 4 ways to stop comparison TODAY.We have a worksheet you can download at www.thebodylovesociety.com/68\xa0\xa0Have you ever been on social media and scrolled by a picture that made your heart drop?That gave you an icky feeling of comparison?Were you feeling pretty good and after you saw “the picture” you immediately went into spiraling thoughts about what you don’t have that you wish you did?\xa0\xa0This is a classic case of compare and despair- and don’t you worry this is a very normal human thing to do - especially in our new age of social media. We are able to see into way more people\'s lives than we ever have just by the tap of a phone screen or click on your laptop. It’s too easy! And it can be very overwhelming…\xa0This is why we want to address how you can redirect your thoughts of comparison!\xa0\xa01. Lift the Story\xa0\xa0When you are comparing yourself to others you most likely are creating a story and making it mean something other than “what is” …\xa0For example - you scroll past a picture of someone that has a “better body than you” - instead of just seeing the photo for what it is “A woman posing in a picture in her bathing suit or that cute outfit” - you start\xa0spiralling\xa0and making it mean something personal about you ….\xa0“Ugh I hate my body, she looks so much better.”“I’m such a failure, why can’t I look like that, I’ve tried so hard.”\xa0“No one will ever love me because of my body.”\xa0“If I don’t have a body like that I won’t get that job.”\xa0“I’m so disgusted with myself, why can’t I just lose weight.”\xa0“I would be so much happier with a body like that, this isn’t fair.”\xa0“I’ll never be able to wear a bathing suit at my vacation coming up because I don’t look like that, everyone will judge me, I’m so embarrassed.”What would it be like if you “LIFTED THE STORY” and didn’t make it mean anything about you?\xa0All of the statements we just shared are just stories you have created. They aren’t real.\xa0You saw\xa0 a woman in a bathing suit. It doesn’t need to mean anything about you.\xa0\xa02. I AM ME, THEY ARE THEM.Separate yourself from the person you are comparing yourself to by saying…. “I am me and they are them.”Her life has nothing to do with your life. It really doesn’t!\xa0We all co-exist AND that doesn’t mean that when someone else has something you don’t, means that you are lacking something in your life.\xa0If someone has a certain body, it doesn’t mean you have a bad body.If someone is successful it doesn’t mean you can’t be successful.\xa0If someone has children, it doesn’t mean you never will.\xa0If someone just bought a home, it doesn’t mean you can’t.\xa0If someone has anything that you want, it doesn’t mean that you can’t have it too.\xa0You are never lacking, you are a whole and complete person no matter what your circumstances are. No person is better or worse. We are equal, we are all human.\xa0To quiet the noise - limit social media and unfollow triggers and then get out your journal and write down all the wonderful things you have in your life because sometimes we forget in comparison.\xa0\xa03. DIFFERENT TIMELINES\xa0Of course there are a lot of body comparisons but what about comparisons in general …\xa0We all are living our separate lives with different timelines- could you imagine if EVERYONE on the planet was forced to do everything at the same time?Go to college at the same time, graduate at the same time, date at the same time, get engaged at the same time, get married at the same time, have kids at the same time, take on a career opportunity at the same time, travel at the same time, buy a house at the same time etc….\xa0That wouldn\'t be human- that would strip us of the opportunity to allow our lives to unfold however they unfold and be open to all the possibilities… because what if you don’t want to get married or have kids? What if you want to travel the world and build a business? Different timelines allow us to be free in what we actually want to do with our lives.\xa0If we could control our timelines and get what we wanted when we wanted life would be boring. We would miss out on so many things that actually shape us and grow us into who we are…\xa0Lifting the story and the meaning while separating yourself as an individual with your own timeline can do wonders when trapped in comparison!\xa0One more quick mindset hack you can use around comparison is called Freaky Friday and you can learn more about it in episode 15 “Heal your comparison-itis”.\xa04. REFRAME\xa0Most likely if you are comparing yourself to someone, they are either comparing themselves to you or to someone else.We all are just going in circles doing the same damn thing- comparing ourselves to others feeling like we are lacking something.\xa0What if this person was comparing their life to yours? That you had something they didn’t and they made it mean something about them?\xa0Would you think - “Yeah, that\'s right, you aren’t as good as me because I have something you want.”\xa0NO! You would probably think that you are no more special than they are and just because you have something they want doesn’t make them inferior. You would probably think that whatever you have they can have too.\xa0This is an important reframe because you realize how NOT TRUE the feelings are when we get stuck in comparison.\xa0You can see much better from the outside in - You see the other person has worthy and deserving. If you can do that so easily for someone else - why not yourself?\xa0We are all human, comparison is going to happen - it’s how we respond to it that will set us free.\xa0Remember to grab your worksheet at bit.ly/compareworksheetYou’ll be able to go through and process the 4 ways to stop comparison.See you next week!\xa0Lauren and Jenna\xa0 | Ever wonder why Weight Watchers and other popular diets don\'t work?You can go right to the podcast episode. LISTEN HERE.This episode includes a free worksheet that you can grab hereWe had an amazing conversation on our Instagram the other day. It was all about weight watchers and it started because a woman reached out to us and said she was a researcher for WW and wanted to know what intuitive eating means to those who subscribe to it. NOTE: They are clearly trying to coop intuitive eating language so they can seem like they’re teaching a healthy food relationship when in fact they are just selling another diet.Women were sharing their WW (weight watchers) stories and the reason it was so powerful was because we were also receiving messages like this…“While reading these comments and crying I finally understand that I’m not a failure!”\xa0YES! We all have stories like these but we just don\'t share them enough so we think we’re all alone.Here\'s just one of many stories we received...\xa0So why do we all have similar stories like this?Stories like this are so predictable and common because diets cause our bodies to react in certain ways and our minds to get stuck in certain thought patterns - both of which that are NOT what you are looking for.Physically, restriction (meaning not eating to satisfaction, not just eating what you THINK is enough) causes a lot of anguishPrimal hungerBinge eatingPreoccupation with food because your body thinks it’s in a famine!!Mentally restriction causes a lot of problems as well. This preoccupation with food distracts us from our lives and it ends up being all we’re thinking about!We become anxious, obsessive, guilty and ashamed when we give in to it all, inevitably.ANY program that limits food in any way - food group, calories, amounts etc. is a diet.Always.Every time.No exceptions.Diets such as:Keto, whole 30 - these are pretty self explanatory, they limit food groups, simple enough.But what about intermittent fasting, macros and WW ? These technically allow you to eat whatever you want. But do they? NO - there are always limitations.And limitations mean diets.So how CAN we identify a diet when it seems iffy?(Many companies are adopting IE language so sometimes it genuinely can be tricky)Signs to look out for:Any mention of weighing or weight lossLimitations around any certain foods, food groups, timing of eating., ANYTHINGAny talk around THIS being “the way”. There is absolutely nothing that works for everyone (other than listening to YOUR own body of course).Any numbers - calories, weight, macros, etcMention of healing your relationship with food/ ending binge eating without talking about needing to stop restricting.Lastly, the mindsets that these diets get you in is really what keeps you stuck in the cycle and making it HARD to get out.\xa0These mindsets are:1. All or nothing thinkingThis is the mindset that gets us stuck in the cycleCounting your points perfectly all week just to go crazy after your weigh inEither you’re being perfect or saying screw itHow can we begin escaping this mindset?Reflect daily on where you could have it all.Could you go to the gym AND join your friends for pizza tonight still?Could you have that salad but its ok to skip the gym, you\'re so tired!Could you have a couple of your moms cookies and then move on with your day normally?Beginning to see where you can create more ebb and flow in your daily life will move you towards being able to have it all and get out of the cycle for good.2. Thinking of food as good or badThis is what we were taught our whole lives.So its totally normal to think this way but heres the thing...Many of us think as more nutritious and less nutritious foods as good or bad but that brings morality into it.You aren\'t good if you eat your veggies and bad if you have dessert but that is really how diet culture functions.This brings guilt and shame into eating which leads to bingeing and the all or nothing cycle all over again.How can we begin escaping this mindset?Reflect on your language - do you say things like…"I was so good today.""Oh I’m being so bad tonight as you reach for another slice of pizza.""I’m going to be good starting Monday."Working on language can be very powerful, if we start speaking differently we will naturally begin to think differently.Shift your language whenever you notice yourself speaking this way - you can say, "I’m going to eat another piece of pizza", "I ate a lot of nutritious foods today"…. Etc\xa03. Inflexibility/ rigidityBeing flexible is pretty much the foundation of intuitive eating and UnDieting.But dieting is quite the opposite - its all about rigidity and inflexibility.Hello meal plans, counting a certain amount of points every single day of your life.. No room for adjustments or variations. And when you do cross the very strict line?Well screw it! May as well go crazy and start again on Monday.We want to get out of rigid thinking and into flexibility!How do we escape this rigid mindset?When you feel something didn’t go as planned, you got too full or even binged, take a deep breath and ask yourself what the next best step is - not the knee jerk reaction of screw it but actually make a calm decision.This might take practice and as our "screw it" muscles can be very strong.Get your free worksheet to go with this episode so you can work on getting away from these 3 mindsets and into a life of wellness without the obsession.Talk soon!Love, Lauren and JennaPS.

It may even feel freeing. You are so happy to be done with dieting and it’s exciting to be able to allow all food and not feel constantly judged, shamed, and guilted for the food you eat.\xa0There are so many perks to UnDieting and a lot of the time it feels so peaceful. You wonder why you didn’t find this earlier because you feel like you could have skipped out on a lot of suffering in the past with the diet days.\xa0You may even have found yourself in a groove - having good feelings around all of this-\xa0 tuning into your body and having wellness without the obsession- of course you are still learning so much and this is still very new to you but you know it feels right!\xa0And now we want to bring the human into all of this---\xa0We want to let you know that there WILL be some hard days on this journey to fully embracing being an UnDieter.\xa0One day you may feel free and the next you may be completely blind sided by a binge.\xa0One day you may feel good in your body and in a place of acceptance and the next day you’re having a meltdown that your pants feel snug and the body image thoughts go spiraling!One day you may feel completely calm around eating dessert after dinner and stopping when you’re satisfied and the next you’re judging yourself for wanting dessert every night and thinking it’s not okay!\xa0We are here to tell you THIS IS NORMAL THIS IS HUMAN AND THIS IS TEMPORARY.\xa0\xa0When you have a hard day - here’s what to do:\xa0Don’t panic- you aren’t backsliding - you didn’t ruin anything. You aren’t a bad and horrible person. You simply are human who had a tough day and felt challenging emotions. THAT IS LIFE. Amazing feel good emotions and harder challenging emotions will always co-exist. You cant have light without the dark - so remember when you feel these harder emotions- tell yourself that it’s okay to not be okay. These feelings will pass. Learn from the experience! - Instead of judgement get curious- ask yourself questions. What was happening that day? Did anything trigger it? Have you truly been allowing all food or has there been some physical or mental restriction? You don’t need to find the answer- it’s just get curious instead of judging yourself. Allow the feelings, be gentle with yourself, and let them pass.\xa0Allow the feelings- don’t react- Just because you had a bad day doesn’t mean you need to react with a game plan on what you’re going to do to “fix” this- you don’t need to plan a diet or any type of restriction. You don’t need to plan out a workout plan or tell yourself you’re going to do better in xyz categories… Just BE. Humans will do anything not to feel uncomfortable emotions. Allow yourself to feel and just be with them. Let them pass. No need to react. Get support in this area of your life - so you don’t let the overwhelming days take you down- if it’s talking to someone you trust or someone who is also UnDieting - a FB group ( we have one) or you could look into The UnDiet Academy- the doors are closed for now but if you are interested you can get on the waitlist so you are first to know when the doors open :)\xa0\xa0So remember - when you feel like there are really hard days/ moments/ feelings - or you really don’t like what happened (like a binge etc) know that this IS NORMAL - it’s part of the process. Be sure to follow us on Instagram www.instagram.com/thebodylovesociety where you can get daily coaching - also send us a DM! We love hearing from you!\xa0Love, Lauren and Jenna\xa0 | Today on How to love your body we are talking about something that was brought up in The UnDiet Academy - what do you do if you don’t know WHAT you feel like eating??"Something I’m having the most trouble with lately is knowing what I feel like eating, because I have difficulty tuning into what I actually want to eat. Sometimes I just dont eat at all or\xa0 I find myself asking what’s the “healthiest” option and after that question I just kind of give up, in an effort to stop labelling food, and I grab the quickest thing to eat (cereal, muesli bar) even if it’s not necessarily what I want."\xa0This is a classic case of being too rigid with intuitive eating which then just turns it into another diet.\xa0If your body is hungry, eat. It doesn’t matter if it’s not exactly what you want in this moment but choose from what is available, what sounds good and you think would feel good (note this doesn’t always mean the “healthy” option!). Cookies can feel amazing!\xa0If you think you have to know exactly what you want in every moment, it’ll be too much pressure, too much perfectionism!This is what lands us in situations where we go, screw it, ill eat whatevers easiest and move on.\xa0Instead ask yourself these questions:What COULD I have right now?\xa0Maybe its not realistic to leave the house right now, so whats in the fridge?What of these options seems the most appealing right now?Which would feel the best?What is my body asking for?\xa0Then you can choose something that will honor your body while it not having to be the PERFECT thing.\xa0When we get in food ruts-\xa0 this is a great thing to do (or when you go to the grocery store next) - we want you to open your eyes to choosing differently - choose things you have never tried before, what looks good, nutritious/ pleasurable- doesn’t matter. You may not even realize what you like - so it’s a time of exploration, curiosity, and figuring out what you truly like and not just what feels safe or coming from diet culture!\xa0\xa0\xa0It’s easy to just pick a “go to food” because it’s what we know. It feels safe.\xa0\xa0You may not know what you want because you don’t even know what you like because there’s been so many dang rules.\xa0\xa0If there were no rules (there aren’t) - as if you forgot every diet rule there was out there - what would you choose to taste? To try? To explore?\xa0\xa0Maybe you freaking hate protein bars you just know it’s a safe easy food - Try a different one! See if it actually tastes good!\xa0\xa0SWITCH IT UP!!!\xa0\xa0Ex. I use to love these certain bars and protein cookies\xa0 ( they were a “cheat” in my mind) - once I started allowing food and I didn’t have to treat a protein bar like dessert and a protein cookie like a real cookie- I actually was able to taste them.\xa0\xa0I realized they didn’t taste as good as I thought. It doesn;t mean I’ll never eat these things ever again - it just means I was able to taste it for what it was. No some god like food and some cheat when it really wasn’t that amazing!\xa0\xa0We learned to explore food. To actually have likes and dislikes no matter what kind of food it was- I even have a preference on certain greens. I much rather have a kale salad than an arugula salad and I’d much rather have pizza than a bowl of pasta. I’ve learned preferences and likes and dislikes because of all the allowing and exploring!\xa0Go in with the intention of choosing new new new. That entire day - do things differently - driving to the store go a different way. If you always shower, take a bath etc… try it out!\xa0\xa0The doors are closed to The UnDiet Academy but get on the waitlist to be notified when the doors open again here bit.ly/undietwaitlistBe sure to follow us on instagram for daily coaching at www.instagram.com/thebodylovesociety\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'The non-diet, intuitive eating podcast to help you stop thinking about food all day and end binge eating.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/74/f6/f8/74f6f88f-f2d8-78f5-55e4-4bb9bfed4cf9/mza_1730463402337413639.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2018-04-12'}}

The things we like to eat, the products we use, things that are very important to us, just the inside scoop.\xa0 People might find us weird, but how we come across on “Rebel Weight Loss and Lifestyle” is truly how we are. When you meet us in person, if you\'re watching us on Youtube or listening to our podcast, we are no different. I and Cari are similar in many ways. We are both early risers, and we both have a pretty strict exercise routine - we\'re both morning workout people. We both love having eggs and bacon. We both love unsweetened nut milk. We both are big fans of clarified butter. And we both love Milk of Magnesia - the pink drink that is a boon when it comes to constipation. One of my non-negotiables when I travel, and I travel quite a bit - I always drink all my water. When one is travelling, it’s easier to get dehydrated. I am fiercely protective of my sleep. I’m a broccoli and cauliflower fan. I like hiking. Cari loves going on adventures.\xa0 She loves the ocean. She really loves to read and her favorite author is Francine Rivers. She loves research, and getting into the hot tub. She likes watching cake-decorating videos on Youtube.... Want to know more about what makes us tick? Just stay tuned.\xa0 \xa0 Key Points of Discussion  Cari wakes up early just like Cristy does, and hits the ground running (6:47) She hasn’t been able to sleep in since losing weight and becoming a gym person (9:04) We both are steady five days a week when it comes to exercising (9:52) I\'m only going to eat those two meals and I just want to make it count (24:45) Cari loves meeting new people and going places she’s never been (29:00) I like to do things to take my mind off Code Red, trying to take 30-minute bursts (32:20) --------------------------------------------- \xa0 Get your FREE copy of the On-The-Go Guide for Code Red approved food here: http://bit.ly/on-the-go-guide \xa0 You can find out more about Cristy and the topic covered in this episode by checking out her website here. \xa0 --------------------------------------------- \xa0 Lose your first, next, or last 10 pounds with absolutely NO pills, powders, shakes, or exercise required.\xa0 \xa0 Click here to take the 10 pound takedown challenge! \xa0 Be sure to grab your copy of my book, The Code Red Revolution here.\xa0 \xa0 Connect with Cristy: Facebook Instagram LinkedIn YouTube \xa0 --------------------------------------------- \xa0 Subscribe to the podcast on  Apple,  Spotify Stitcher, YouTube or anywhere else you listen to your podcasts. \xa0 If you haven\'t already, please rate and review the podcast on  Apple Podcasts!   | Remember where you came from! Before you pass judgment on someone, don\'t forget that was you not so very long ago. Lots of those who opt for the Rebel Weight Loss program end up going through a 10-pound takedown challenge and their eyes are now open and then they now judge other people who are buying the “junk” at the grocery store. But when they cock a snook at them, they conveniently forget that not too long ago, they were in their shoes.\xa0 Well, never forget what it felt like to be fat!\xa0 It\'s not really hard to go back there if you\'re not careful. When you see somebody in the grocery store, and they have just all kinds of processed sugar-laden, chemical crap foods in their cart, it’s simply because they don\'t know any better. After all, for all we know, nobody out there means to poison their kids.\xa0 Just so you know, that was you 10 pounds ago, or you 20 pounds ago. Maybe that was you 100 pounds ago. But let\'s never lose our compassion and never forget what it was like to be that person.\xa0 And if you want to help people by telling them about Code Red, remember - There is a time and a place for everything, and your personal testimony will mean more than anything else. You could say something like, “Yeah, well, I\'ve lost weight and kept it off.” And then if they\'re ready for it, they’ll want to know more about it. I and Cari are going to tell you more about the importance of bearing in mind where you come from, so stay tuned. \xa0 Key Points of Discussion  Sad to see someone struggling with weight and having kids yelling for sugar (7:39) Most of them don\'t know that real food, water and sleep are the keys (9:46) It\'s just so easy to go back there (10:33) Being secure in Code Red and not being arrogant about it (13:55) If you want to tell people about Code Red, let your life lead them by example (15:02) Remembering what it was like when you first started out losing weight (28:02)  --------------------------------------------- \xa0 Get your FREE copy of the On-The-Go Guide for Code Red approved food here: http://bit.ly/on-the-go-guide \xa0 You can find out more about Cristy and the topic covered in this episode by checking out her website here. \xa0 --------------------------------------------- \xa0 Lose your first, next, or last 10 pounds with absolutely NO pills, powders, shakes, or exercise required.\xa0 \xa0 Click here to take the 10 pound takedown challenge! \xa0 Be sure to grab your copy of my book, The Code Red Revolution here.\xa0 \xa0 Connect with Cristy: Facebook Instagram LinkedIn YouTube \xa0 --------------------------------------------- \xa0 Subscribe to the podcast on  Apple,  Spotify  Stitcher,  YouTube or anywhere else you listen to your podcasts. \xa0 If you haven\'t already, please rate and review the podcast on  Apple Podcasts! | Introducing Code Red to family members could be tricky!

Have you been eating a sapien diet recently? Are you feeling better than ever? Or is it just me? Many people are probably doing it without even realizing it. It’s basically just a high animal food, high fat, low carb, low antinutrient diet with a condensed eating window. We talk a lot about why this way of eating is so beneficial and so misunderstood today with the legendary Nina Teicholz. She is an adjunct professor at NYU’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, the Executive Director of The Nutrition Coalition (a group devoted to evidence-based nutrition policy), an investigative science journalist and author of the must-read book Big Fat Surprise. Just go read it now. Seriously. She spent almost 10 years researching and digging up studies to blow the top off one of the biggest mistakes in human history. Yes she says it. Demonizing cholesterol and human health foods like red meat and saturated fat has truly been a catastrophe for the health of our world. She got in this early and made waves, woke people up, and got the movement going. She and Gary Taubes have been instrumental in getting the word out to the mainstream. Listen up everyone, she’s awesome! I have a few more things before we start, though. We’re actually still looking for a story or two to weave into the film. If you know a family whose kids have lost a ton of weight, I’d love to hear from them. I’m also interested in connecting with an LA based editor and videographer that can help make some more youtube content with us. We have a lot of things cooking and not enough chefs! Do you have pets? We’ve got the healthiest pet food possible at http://NoseToTail.org It’s grass finished ground beef with all the organs in it, specially made for animals. Get some for yourself while you're at it. We make it for humans too. We also have high omega 3 pork and chicken that’s pasture raised and fed a special diet. The meat and fat are loaded with possibly the best omega 3 to omega 6 ratio in America.

  Preorder the film here: http://indiegogo.com/projects/food-lies-post \xa0  SHOW NOTES  Nina is a journalist who spent nearly a decade writing her book The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet\xa0 She thought she was writing about science but realized she was writing about politics\xa0 She started Nutrition Coalition to bring an alternative point of view to Washington to try and get government support to change the dietary guidelines Turns out Americans follow the dietary guidelines, but are still getting sick Consumption of red meat, butter, and whole milk are down\xa0 Consumption of grains and vegetable oils are up\xa0 Ever since the dietary guidelines were introduced in the 1980s diabetes and obesity rates have exploded\xa0 No one can prove that the guidelines caused these epidemics, but we have a body of science that show if people ignore the guidelines and eat high fat low carb they can manage and reverse their diseases suggesting that the guidelines are no promoting health\xa0 Quote from Nina’s book: “But like lost languages, lost skills, and lost songs, it takes only a few generations to forget” It seems normal that everyone has a disease, but it’s not normal\xa0 Challenging the idea of low-fat plant-based diets is extremely difficult because it is enshrined at the highest levels and there is a lot of corporate interest behind it\xa0 The main ingredients in the grocery stores are sugar, grains, and vegetable oils\xa0 Food only became medicalized in the 1950s when people were suffering from heart disease Diet-Heart Hypothesis introduced by Ancel Keys claiming that saturated fat and cholesterol would clog your arteries like hot oil down a cold pipe and that would lead to a heart attack\xa0 The first dietary recommendation in the world was to limit saturated fat issued by the AHA in 1961 It wasn’t until 1970 that all fats were demonized and not just saturated fats\xa0 The AHA recognized that they didn’t have all the answers but they couldn’t imagine any negative unintended consequences but in reality, the unintended consequences were two-fold By cutting down on saturated fats we shifted to PUFA vegetable oils which turned out to cause higher death rates from cancer Since 1960 we have increased carbohydrate consumption by 30% and have decreased fat since 1965 by around 30% and protein has stayed relatively constant They tested the diet-heart hypothesis after the dietary recommendations had already been made, and were never able to support it by science\xa0 The majority of studies that couldn’t confirm any health benefits to low-fat diets were largely ignored and considered “silent studies” it was too uncomfortable for anyone to admit they might have got things wrong The Minnesota Coronary Survey study wasn’t published for 16 years because the researchers weren’t happy with the results since they didn’t support a low-fat diet for reducing risk of heart disease [29:51] The demonization of cholesterol has been one of the greatest mistakes in human history\xa0 All of the trials that swapped out saturated fats for polyunsaturated fats showed increased death rates from cancer but they were so convinced that lowering cholesterol was the answer so they accepted it One of the scariest parts of her book was researching the detrimental effects of vegetable oils which didn’t even exist in the food supply until the early 1900s\xa0 The types of fats in vegetable oils can replace the stable fatty acids in our cell membranes, there are significant effects of these fats on our health\xa0 There are over 100 clinical trials showing the benefit of carbohydrate restriction We need to ask what diet can people stick to in the real-world The metabolic ward studies are flawed because they are short-term\xa0 Type-2 diabetes is reversible [41:31] Nina tried to get media coverage on type-2 diabetes remission with a ketogenic diet and the on air doctor wouldn’t allow it because it contradicted everything he had been promoting over the years Institutions have been promoting low-fat diets for so long that people can’t go back on their word Much of the media are funded by pharmaceutical companies so ads aren’t going to promote lifestyle factors that can get people off their medications\xa0 There is huge corporate investments in meat replacements\xa0 Nina is open minded to the carnivore movement based on the nutrient density of animal foods and the various toxins that can be in plant foods\xa0 We are moving in the right direction by removing the caps on dietary cholesterol and dropping language around low-fat diets We need better science and grass-roots movements to continue this paradigm shift We need our doctors to be educated on this because no one wants to feel like they can’t trust their doctor, and we shouldn’t have to\xa0 [51:18] The foods that are in institutions are determined by the dietary guidelines\xa0 [52:02] If you belong to a large medical practice, you risk medical malpractice if you teach people a low-carb diet if it’s not standard of care, until it’s included in the dietary guidelines its not available as an option\xa0 The focus of the Nutrition Coalition is about doing proper science and reviewing it properly and not ignore science and if the science is done correctly and not ignored we can get answers\xa0 The current dietary guidelines for vegetarianism, mediteranean diet, and DASH diet are supported by almost no evidence We are dealing with politics not evidence\xa0 We need more people spreading this message because everyone shares in a different way that may resonate with someone\xa0  Where to find Nina Teicholz:\xa0 https://twitter.com/bigfatsurprise https://ninateicholz.com/

back for another great episode. I had the pleasure of speaking with Dr. Anthony Jay this week. He’s probably best known for his book Estrogeneration where he explores how all the nasty xenoestrogens creep into our body through plastics, food like soy, personal care products, sunscreen, the water, etc. This is important stuff because you may think it doesn’t affect you, but it does, and you just don’t realize it. You don’t have to go crazy over this stuff, but it’s best to minimize your exposure. What was really cool for me is that I got to talk to him before and after the show and realized what a great wealth of knowledge he has on so many subjects - which is also very apparent throughout the episode. We could have talked all day, but we cut ourselves off at 2 solid hours of hot nutrition talk. Dr. Jay earned his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Boston University School of Medicine, researching fats, hormones, and cholesterol. He’s currently at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota researching stem cells, epigenetics, and infrared light. He also does DNA consulting which I’m going to do with him in the near future. So now for a huge announcement - the SAPIEN show is finally here! I haven’t mentioned it much, but it’s been in the works for a while. It’s recorded on video and audio at SAPIEN headquarters at Evolve Healthcare in Woodland Hills, California with in-person guests.\xa0 My co-host is the one and only Dr. Gary Shlifer who was a recent Peak Human guest. By far the most positive feedback of any episode. Go back and listen if you’d like (it’s episode 48) or just jump in and start with the Sapien podcast that is launching today!\xa0 So I’d suggest pausing this episode and subscribing now before you forget. Go ahead, I’ll wait. Just look up Sapien in any podcast app or on youtube. The podcast version has higher quality audio and the youtube version has our smiling faces! We already have a bunch of great episodes in the bag, including one where Dr. Paul Saladino and Dr. Gary get in a small war. It got awkward after that one. My other co-host is Yaniv Fituci, the producer of Food Lies and co-founder of http://Attack.Media He produces shows for Disney, Sony, Nintendo and all that other Hollywood stuff. He’ll be coming in and out and bringing his awesome perspective into the mix. So I’ll keep it quick this week on how to support this show, myself, and all things Sapien. My main venture is the sapien organization which can be found at http://sapien.org which includes the Food Lies film, Nose to Tail grass finished meat, this podcast, and even the long term vision of changing the way we farm with the Sapien Movement. You can find out more about the Sapien Diet there which people have been asking about. I posted my before and after picture on instagram, facebook, and twitter to show what happens when you eat densely and move intensely and live a Sapien Lifestyle, which is how us modern homo sapiens in 2019 should be living. I swear it’s the easiest thing to do once you understand what to do and why you’re doing it. I eat the most delicious meals I can imagine until I’m full, never worry about calories or macros, then go work out for 17 minutes most weekdays… and this helped me transform my body and my life. So start eating densely with all the grass finished meat on http://NoseToTail.org support this podcast so I can keep doing it at http://patreon.com/peakhuman preorder the film so we can finish it - the more funds we have, the sooner it will come out.

I’m a bit behind this week due to the holiday and filming a couple more awesome interviews for the Food Lies documentary. Every time I think we’re done, I get a new opportunity to talk to an amazing expert. Yesterday we filmed with Professor Craig Stanford a USC anthropologist and world-renowned authority on primates who walked us through how savage our chimp ancestors were and still are. It’s no vegan utopia out there with them quietly munching on leaves and twigs. They hunt monkeys and rip them apart and eat them with their bare hands. He also explained the changes our bodies, brains, and digestive systems went through as we began eating more and more nutrient dense animal foods and became human. Then today we hit my alma mater UCLA completing the cross-town rivalry professor square-off and talked to Dr. Aaron Blaisdell. He’s a powerful force in the ancestral health space and actually co-founded the Ancestral Health Society which puts on the Ancestral Health Symposium each year. They bridge the gap between the science and researchers in academia with the rest of the world. They’re basically undoing all the weak correlations and bad epidemiology that’s been done in the last 60 years that gave red meat and saturated fat a bad name using actual hard science. It’s a little sad that we need this group of “crazy rebels” to show us simple facts of human evolution and animal foods being the foundation of how we became human and continue to be the foundation of health. So check them out and support the Food Lies film at http://FoodLies.org We’re on Indiegogo and you can help us finish the film by clicking through - one more time FoodLies.org - and pre-ordering a copy. It’s seriously the only way we can fight this battle - which is crazy that it is turning into an actual battle for our right to eat the healthiest foods on the planet. Speaking of eating animal foods, Nose to tail is going strong and it’s hard to keep all the meat in stock. By the time you’re hearing this we should be back with some of our signature products such as the primal ground beef with liver, heart, kidney, and spleen mixed in. We’ve got a ton of nose to tail cuts of beef, buffalo, lamb, pork, and chicken as well on http://NoseToTail.org Quick thank you to supporters on Patreon - help the tribe survive with a few dollars there and help us continue to stay afloat. Get the extended show notes and Slack invite link on http://patreon.com/peakhuman So onto the guest this week, Chris Masterjohn, PhD. If you haven't heard of him, you should have because he’s a force of nature when it comes to nutritional research. He’s got a PhD in nutritional sciences and knows more than just about anyone concerning how fat, carbs, protein, vitamins, and minerals work in our body. He’s publishing papers, putting out tons of great content on his site and youtube, has a masterclass series, and is a great guy for putting up with all my questions. I hope he wasn’t put off by this interview that I pushed to the very last minute before his next meeting. I wanted to bring up a lot of points that went against the standard nutritional narrative. I think a strict carnivore diet (or victus I should say - which is a better word than diet that I think we should be using) is super interesting and wanted to see what he thought about it. It gets technical in the beginning, but hold on and wait for the end, because that’s when it really gets good. So here’s the interview, I hope you enjoy it. \xa0  BUY THE MEAT\xa0NosetoTail.org   Support me on Patreon! http://patreon.com/peakhuman   Preorder the film here: http://indiegogo.com/projects/food-lies-post \xa0  SHOW NOTES  Chris Masterjohn has his PhD in Nutritional Sciences\xa0 He runs his own online blog and programs at  https://chrismasterjohnphd.com Chris’ definition of nutrient density and selecting nutrient dense foods\xa0 The importance of nutrient balance when considering nutrient density\xa0 Why looking at nutrients per calorie isn’t that useful, for example if you compared protein per calorie for broccoli it would be very high but no one is going to eat that amount of calories of broccoli to ever reach a sufficient amount of protein\xa0 He has a 5 tier ranking system that helps you figure out which foods help you hit your nutrient targets for the day and which don’t\xa0 You can either choose to eat foods super dense in nutrients or you can choose to eat a lot of different foods that are moderately dense in nutrients Why he is strongly against Joel Fuhrman’s nutrient density score You want to consume all the essential nutrients well over the point of being deficient without being near the point of having too much\xa0 Reaching riboflavin toxicity is unheard of\xa0 The role of vitamin D in preventing leaching calcium from your bones\xa0 The interactions of vitamin D with vitamin K and vitamin A in preventing calcification in soft-tissues (ie. anything but bones and teeth) If you don’t balance vitamin D with vitamins A and K you may be at risk for soft-tissue calcification (e.g. kidney stones) and this is a danger of having too much vitamin D You can read about is theory here:  https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/from-seafood-to-sunshine-a-new-understanding-of-vitamin-d-safety/ Animal foods with vitamins A and K: 4-8oz of liver per week, cod liver oil, egg yolks, full-fat dairy products (you won’t get enough vitamin A and K with dairy and egg yolks alone) Plant foods with vitamin A: red/orange/yellow/green vegetables have vitamin A in the form of carotenoids that needs to be converted into the form in animal foods which is retinol, these are good sources of vitamin A but many people have poor conversion rates, there are also other factors that can interfere with the conversion\xa0 Two main forms of vitamin K: K1 (in plants - fermented foods like sauerkraut or natto) and K2 (in animals - fermented dairy (cheese, yogurt), liver, egg yolks, meat, etc.)\xa0 Non-fermented animal foods have MK4 that appears to have unique and essential roles in humans Most people are bad at converting vitamin K to MK4 therefore it’s a good insurance policy to get vitamin K from animal foods The dropout rate of vegans is very high\xa0 Carnivore shares a lot in common with veganism by cutting out a whole group of foods and the risks are the same because you are cutting out certain nutrient profiles\xa0 You are vulnerable to getting too much of something on the carnivore diet Why eating too much protein could be bad\xa0 Carnivores are also vulnerable to not getting enough manganese and vitamin C\xa0 There’s no longitudinal data on carnivore diets and the life-long effects and there is no human population that traditionally eats a carnivore diets\xa0 Weston Price looked for vegans and only found cannibals:  https://www.westonaprice.org/weston-price-looked-for-vegans-but-found-only-cannibals/ All traditional diets emphasize animal products for health but they also all eat plants Even at the extremes of the arctic where plants barely grow, they try very hard to get plants Theoretically, if you insist on being carnivore then the best way to avoid nutrient deficiencies you would need to eat nose to tail, there are no nutrients you can’t get\xa0 What is in an animal’s tissues is a snapshot of what that animal needed in that tissue at the time it died Eating nose to tail and shellfish (especially mussels for manganese) and eating fish is probably going to prevent you from nutrient deficiencies if carnivore Risk of not getting enough vitamin C\xa0 Solutions to acid-base issues on carnivore There are no populations that were chronically keto\xa0 If you look at the anthropological spread of traditional diets across the globe correlates strongly with latitude, the maximum plant consumption is at the equator and the further you go from the equator the more animal products are consumed\xa0 Plant foods availability goes down and down as you move from the equator and Chris believes this is the main thing that has driven more animal foods in the diet\xa0 Even when plant foods are maximally abundant, no one has chosen to eat all plants\xa0 Calorie availability was probably the driver of food choices\xa0 Canadian Natives prevented scurvy by eating the adrenal glands of moose All cultures were either seeking plant foods or obscure parts of the animal that were more nutrient dense that you could usually get from plants like vitamin C\xa0 The default for humans is neither vegan or carnivore\xa0 We have protein needs and you can choose carbs and fats in a way that provides micronutrients, fits your lifestyle, and in a way you won’t overeat The physiological requirements for glucose are only low if you are keto-adapted Chris does not believe you need less vitamin C if you aren’t eating carbohydrates (i.e. the theory that glucose and vitamin C compete for the same transporter)\xa0 Carbs are generally going to improve vitamin C recycling\xa0 Plant polyphenols are toxins that we have co-evolved throughout animal evolution and we are adapted to them and learned how to exploit them to increase our defences without allowing them to cause toxicity - it increases our defences enough to make it a net positive Anything that’s hormetic is only hormetic in the hormetic range and then it’s toxic\xa0 People that react to plants and go carnivore probably have genetic problems with their defense mechanisms For most of us, plants and vegetables are hormetic\xa0 We know mechanistically what molecules in plants do and how they benefit us Chris' site http://chrismasterjohnphd.com  \xa0  BUY THE MEAT\xa0NosetoTail.org   Support me on Patreon! http://patreon.com/peakhuman   Preorder the film here: http://indiegogo.com/projects/food-lies-post   \xa0   Film site: http://FoodLies.org   YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/FoodLies   Sapien Movement: http://SapienMovement.com   \xa0   Follow along:   http://twitter.com/FoodLiesOrg   http://instagram.com/food.lies   http://facebook.com/FoodLiesOrg   \xa0   Theme music by https://kylewardmusic.com/  | Hey hey, what’s going on healthy friends? Is everyone eating densely and moving intensely? People have been saying I should make shirts or stickers for that phrase. Anyone want to help design that? I want it to look really cool. Also for new people, or anyone really, I should quickly spell out what eating densely and moving intensely is. A nutrient dense diet with a full array of bioavailable nutrients and the least processing, sugar, and other antinutrients is what I’ve been exploring for the past 5 years and more intensely for the last 2. I’ve landed on the sapien diet which is really a framework that many good dietary strategies fit into. Go to sapien.org/diet to learn more. Moving instesley just means resistance training and high intensity stuff like sprinting. There’s nothing wrong with long cardio workouts if you enjoy them, I just don’t think they're that efficient timewise or for weight loss. Start back at episode one of this podcast if you haven't caught them all - you’ll be glad you did. So hard cut transition to today’s episode with Dr. Sara Place. She works in sustainable beef production research at National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. She did her PhD under Dr. Frank Mitloehner at UC Davis who’s awesome and was a guest on a very popular episode a few weeks back. She’ll also be presenting tons of information that goes counter to all the vegan propaganda you hear thrown around in mainstream media or the social media world. She works daily to improve the environmental impact of raising cattle. Beef producers also want to do this because they care for the environment just as much if not more than a vegan activist. It’s their livelihood. They care for animals, care for the land, and care about being efficient for the future of these as well as actually trying to make a few dollars off this challenging enterprise. Contrary to popular belief the meat industry gets zero subsidies from the government. Sara was kind enough to spend almost\xa0 2 hours answering all my questions, partly to help prepare me for the presentation I'm giving at the big food industry conference in Chicago at the end of September and the friendly debate with the vegan activist lady after. This really helped and I hope it will help you get the other side of these arguments you never get otherwise. Other updates and thinly veiled promotions include us compiling and editing all our footage for Food Lies. We’re really on a roll here and have some great graphics coming together. You can help fund these on Indiegogo by clicking through http://FoodLies.org My favorite thing I ate last week was definitely the NoseToTail.org lamb. I slow cooked some overnight with onions, rosemary, and garlic. Also the ground lamb with a bit of greek seasoning is one of the best things ever. Always sad when that runs out. Get a box delivered to you at NoseToTail.org and add on some marrow bones or cod liver - get some extra nutrition in the mix. Also want to say thank you to Kristi for helping me daily. She also puts together the extended show notes for this podcast for supporters on Patreon at http://Patreon.com/peakhuman Throwing a few bucks a month helps support all this work. I’ll say it again - I really appreciate this community and couldn't do it without you guys! Much love! Alright so that’s it!

sustainable beef production research at National Cattlemen’s Beef Association This association serves as a contractor to the Beef Checkoff Program which is a program that beef farmers and ranchers fund for research and promotion as it relates to beef in the US and part of that is sustainability which is what she manages www.beefitswhatsfordinner.com/ Her research at UC Davis was measuring methane emission directly from cattle People think the beef industry is an evil empire, but there are people trying to improve the impact\xa0 [5:30] Its harder to find something more important than how are we going to nourish ourselves for the next few decades [6:30] only around 10% of cattle’s diet is edible to humans\xa0 Beef production in the US is based on grazing, forage of whole plants, and most are finished on grain\xa0 People assume cows spend their whole life in a feedlot but this is not the case [8:44] Most of the animals are primarily eating forage, almost all feed resources going into producing beef is mostly forage the stuff humans can’t eat\xa0 CO2 out of the air, is transformed through photosynthesis, carbon is captured in plants, and if we ate them we wouldn’t be able to access the energy, but ruminants can and they turn it into food, it’s a symbiotic relationship Beef production is not inefficient Feed for beef is not in competition with the human food supply\xa0 If we were to compare cattle, to pigs, to chicken, it would look like cows would look like they need a lot more feed resources but if we look at human edible feed inputs, cattle are consuming less than chicken and pigs or at least equivalent\xa0 Chickens and pigs are monogastric, they have to eat more energy dense feed and higher quality protein source\xa0 Ruminants can consume forage resources and have a symbiotic relationship with the microbes in their gut that ferment the material and convert it into something that the animal can absorb and metabolize This also plays into the feed efficiency when we look at what are human edible protein inputs going into the system vs outputs, this is where ruminants shine and are much more efficient than pigs or chickens, ruminants are the best from this standpoint\xa0 About 10% for US average of grain going to cattle but another 7-8% is from byproduct feed that humans can’t consume\xa0 [15:47] Cattles take this waste product and upcycle into something of worth\xa0 The plant based vs animal based foods dichotomy is false because it doesn’t take into consideration how agriculture works Plant and animal agriculture is integrated\xa0 Plant-based companies are indirectly supporting animal agriculture There are farms that integrate animal and plant agriculture together (for example, 1 acre of land producing corn and also supporting cattle for part of the year) A lot of corn is grown to make ethanol and then cows can eat the byproducts of this\xa0 Crops today are far more efficient (higher yield for less space) 38% of all domestic corn use in the US goes towards corn ethanol production for fuel and the same amount goes to all livestock, beef cattle is around 10% of this Cattle accounts for about 8 million acres of corn, that’s about 2% of US cropland acres [24:43] We generate more human protein by taking that corn and running it through cattle to generate beef than consuming that corn directly\xa0 If we look at the whole US cattle system we generate two times more high quality protein than goes into the cattle themselves\xa0 We have to ask the question “What’s the alternative?” Soy as an alternative protein source wouldn’t produce more protein per acre than cattle [28:55] These discussions are too far from reality because we have to consider what the actual alternative would be, and where corn is grown, a common alternative would be in fact a corn-soy rotation this is reality we’re not going to start growing quinoa or something similar If we remove the cattle industry we lose grasslands and these grasslands play a crucial role in the environment and in ecosystems\xa0 [31:14] We could have a much smaller land footprint by producing a certain crop but we are degrading the soil over time so it’s not a durable or resilient system, so is that better?\xa0 We’ve lost the connection between the reality of the human animal bond and just the fact that human beings are part of the cycle You can visit beefitswhatsfordinner.com to see 360 degree videos of feedlots\xa0 Feedlot operators are proud of what they do, and the perception that its evil crushes them\xa0 Feedlot practices are a lot better than what is represented online\xa0 There are PhD researchers who formulate the diets of these animals to make it as efficient as possible it’s much more precise than human nutrition\xa0 The reality is that the resources in North America are lots of forage as well as all this byproduct from processing grain crops and so feeding it to animals makes sense The majority of people live in cities and suburban areas so efficient food production is needed to feed everyone We have gotten more efficient, the number of cattle in a herd today is the same size as it was in 1953 but we produce far more beef and milk with these cattle It is not perfect but we are doing the best we can\xa0 Cattle and livestock are more than just food, they are a source of livelihood for people, they cycle nutrients, they provide all sorts of byproducts, we even use cow material in medicine (heart valve replacements) The life cycle assessments are calculated inappropriately\xa0 [46:45] Eliminating livestock in the US wouldn’t solve anything We are avoiding micronutrient deficiencies when we eat animal-sourced foods\xa0 82% of the cattle’s feed comes from grass and forage, 7% from by products and 11% from grains\xa0 The best source is USDA to find out % use for each US commodity Most of the beef raised in the US are family-run operations, even the feedlots If you want to consume grass-fed beef that’s awesome, but there isn’t substantial evidence to say that grain-fed isn’t healthy When animals go to a packing plant, they are screened for antibiotics and hormones so there is no contamination in the human food supply\xa0 Dairy is very highly regulated and is tested rigorously for antibiotics In the US we have a very safe food supply\xa0 The FDA came out with a regulatory directive over two years ago that you cannot feed antibiotics to livestock for growth promotion but you can for disease prevention They give antibiotic doses based on body weight, it is very precise, and they make sure to give a withdrawal period before going for slaughter where for human medicine the doctor will prescribe antibiotics in dosing that is the same for someone that weighs a lot more than you\xa0 Fossil fuels are a lot worse than the methane produced from cattle On the GHG issue, remember that according to the EPA cattle contribute only 2% of GHG emissions most coming from methane Cattle numbers are stable in the US for the last decade or so but methane is increasing so we can’t point our fingers at cattle If we put all our hopes to fix climate change by eating our way out of it, unfortunately all our hopes will be lost\xa0 If we look at the potential impact of climate change, we do not want to pigeon ourselves into a less diverse agricultural system The government does not directly subsidize beef production in the US it is 100% funded by the farmers and ranchers There is a small group of researchers that kind of just cite each other to create consensus but there is a large amount of data showing the benefit of animal based foods, there is no consensus Beef consumption in the US is going down\xa0 All of the food security challenges are happening in developing countries and we should be helping them out to improve\xa0 A lot of this privileged conversation is coming from the US and Europe and doesn’t take into consideration the other growing countries\xa0 There are so many people depending on animals for livelihood, food, power, etc.\xa0 If we want to make a big difference in climate change, changing your diet is not the way to do it\xa0 Fake meats and lab-grown meat is not the solution\xa0 We already have solar powered plant-based meat, it’s called beef.

We got Dr. Zsofia Clemens from Paleomedicina in Hungary. They’re doing groundbreaking stuff over there curing all types of diseases mainstream medicine believes are incurable. And you know what - they use zero medications. Their whole thing is removing patient’s medications one by one. They’ve published a bunch of studies you can link to from their site. Dr. Zsofia is a neurobiologist and clinical researcher specialized in nutrition, nutritional therapy and brain research. Previously she’s been affiliated with the National Institute of Clinical Neuroscience, Budapest and the Neurological Department, University of Pécs, Hungary and have been involved in research related to epilepsy and sleep, electroencephalography, vitamin D and brain MRI. They take a pretty radical approach. It makes sense to me though. If I ever had one of these diseases I’d follow their program as well. Take a listen. Some of it may be a bit controversial. Let me know what you think on the old Instagram machine. I’ll give a quick nod to the things that make this show possible. First and foremost is http://NoseToTail.org where you can get sustainably raised grass finished beef, buffalo, lamb, and high omega 3 pork, and chicken shipped to your door. This is my company so you’re supporting me by ordering and a Texas ranch. My favorite thing this week is definitely the Omega 3 primal pork breakfast sausage. It’s seasoned so perfectly and you don’t even taste all the great pastured liver, kidney, heart, and spleen mixed in giving it all the great nutrition. I posted a stack of these patties I cooked up with some pastured eggs and cheese online the other day to make people jealous. I’m telling you it was something special. Maybe it’s all in my head. Maybe it’s that I know how nutritious it is as I eat each delicious bite. Who knows. Last couple things - we have the Food Lies film on Indiegogo with a bunch of perks. We still need to fund all the awesome graphics we have planned for the film. This will be important to get across all the info. It’s a lot, but it’s so important to spread this message in a way people can understand. So much of the world doesn't know about this information. If you’re listening, you probably do know it. But just think how long it took you to figure it all out. I’m here trying to get every single bit possible across in 95 minutes. It’s not easy.\xa0 You can preorder the film on Indiegogo or click through from http://FoodLies.org and you can also help the cause by supporting me on Patreon at http://Patreon.com/peakhuman Kristi has been adding to the extended show notes for supporters there.

This is such an interesting episode. One day I’m watching epic nature shows from NatGeo about a group of people subsisting in the freezing arctic tundra on nothing but reindeer and fish, the next day I’m talking to one of them. He originally contacted me to politely correct me on something I mentioned in a post on Instagram that I read in a study about his people. The study claimed that sometimes the reindeer were too lean for them to get enough fat to eat. That’s not the case he said. They boil the heads to get all that good fat from the brain, eat the bone marrow, and even eat the hooves. There’s always enough fat on an animal. We talked about this and so much more. He told me how his people are being affected by anti-meat activists. He told me about his parents early demise due to (in his mind and mine) the bread and sugar they began eating and going away from their native diet. He told me about their lost traditions and the ones they keep. He told me about the steady decline in lifespan and healthspan that drops markedly over each generation. This is one of those rare treats where we get a window into another world. I don’t know if any other one of his people have given a podcast interview and he told me he plans to not ever do one again. Please stay tuned for this one to the very end, it’s a good one...\xa0 But first, I want to have some real talk about my grass finished meat on http://nosetotail.org I know it’s a bit more expensive to eat grass finished, really well-raised meat. I’m having trouble affording it myself. I mean, I don’t even eat all my own product. Like I’ve said many times, there’s no money in well-raised meat. There’s just no profit margin. I should be just selling some keto snack bar or supplement and might be able to afford grass finished meat and ultra sustainable wild caught seafood for every single meal. This is just the price it takes to get animals from calves to slaughter to your door. If you go to costco and see frozen ground beef patties with a label saying grass fed for a couple more dollars than conventional beef, I’d be highly suspect. All cows are grass fed for much of their life so some of these labels can be very deceiving. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Even when I go to my local farmers market where they drive the meat straight from their farm in a bunch of coolers, it still costs $20/lb at best for a ribeye. So anyway, support your local farmer. If you don’t know of any or prefer to just click a few buttons online you can support a small Texas ranch and myself by ordering from http://NoseToTail.org Thanks so much, I really appreciate all the people who have ordered so far. It’s a dream of mine to help supply good meat to people and support American ranchers. I’ll also thrown in the Food Lies film here, which is still available for preorder on Indiegogo. You can also support me on Patreon at http://patreon.com/peakhuman I’ve got some fun news - I’ve been asked to speak at a big food industry conference called Foodscape in Chicago at the end of September. I mention it in this episode. I’m going to do a presentation on why meat is a healthy part of our diet and actually beneficial for the environment. Then a vegan lady will giver her side, then we’ll have a friendly debate with a 3rd person who represents a vegan fake meat company. This is my dream come true! Most of the giant food companies will be there including Impossible Foods. I really hope to reach people in the audience and hopefully even in these big organizations and have them hear the other side. It will be interesting if they accept some of these counterarguments, or it is just about the money.

remote, it’s 100 miles to the nearest town\xa0 Every summer he herds reindeers\xa0 It is a traditional way of living for the Saami to follow the reindeer\xa0 That’s all they eat for months at a time\xa0 Brian wrote a post about the Saami eating fish for fat because the reindeer was too lean but Fredrik reached out to correct him saying the reindeer are not too lean in fact it’s the fish are very lean\xa0 Reindeer in the end of September are very fat\xa0 In summer, they go out in the Tundra to follow the herds and mark the calves\xa0 One herd can take up to 24 hours and they eat dried meat and traditionally would live in teepees they carry with them His parents did it traditionally carrying the teepees around with them but now they stay in more of a camp Herding has changed with modernization and civilization\xa0 Environmentalists affected the use, trade, and sell of seal skin Herding starts around 6pm depending on how many herds there are and how far away they are and can take all night to funnel them into a pen By around 5-6am they will be calm and grazing on pasture in the large pen all day and they will start again the next day\xa0 Fredrik describes how they find and follow the herd\xa0 Herding goes on for about a month When he isn’t herding reindeer, Fredrik makes handicraft (knives, sculptures, cups, etc.) He always knew health is determined by food and lifestyle even when no one was talking about it\xa0 He tries to eat as traditionally as he can\xa0 Indigenous groups don’t experience these modern diseases\xa0 When indigenous populations start eating a westernized diet that’s when their health fails\xa0 His dad died at 96, and just two weeks before he was still able to ski 20km to go see a neighbor\xa0 “Live strong and healthy and drop dead”\xa0 Saami health is declining with each generation We are dying now younger and frail and weak vs dying strong at an older age His parents lost their health when they adopted the dietary recommendations like eating whole grains, no limits on sugar, low saturated fat, etc.\xa0 This generation was also the same generation that started losing their teeth\xa0\xa0 If your teeth are rotting it’s probably a good indication of the wrong diet\xa0 Both his parents died at a young age from dementia and heart disease\xa0 The older traditional people used to tell them that vegetables were bad and they would make them sick The Saami traditional diet is 90% meat but in the summer they eat berries and some fermented leaves The idea of carbohydrates in the summer to fatten up for winter\xa0 Learning from bears: bears will eat reindeer calves in the spring and will eat salmon in the summer, in the fall they will eat tons of berries to fatten up for hibernation, this is the same for humans\xa0 Saami people and genetics APOE4 is common among Saami people Saami people have a certain polymorphism in that helps them digest and take energy more effectively from animal foods (28% of Saami people have this compared to only 2.3 % in Chinese)\xa0 The Saami eat nose to tail The intestines are made into sausages, using the tougher meat on the animal They eat eggs from a special type of bird that lives in the lakes They eat a lot of fish and fish roe too\xa0 They eat berries in the summer until fall\xa0 Traditional story about the Saami people making a deal with the reindeer, promising them a quick and painless death in exchange for their meat and milk Animals in nature die horrible deaths from other animals Fredrik is trying to prevent the Saami organizations from partnering with EAT Lancet and promote plant-based diets\xa0 Gunhild Stordalen (from EAT Lancet) says she is an environmentalist but Saami are environmentalists by birth\xa0 The environment and preserving the land and animals\xa0 The “overkill” or “over hunted” hypothesis doesn’t make sense to Fredrik he has even done the calculations to show it is illogical\xa0 It’s not worth the time to forage and gather all these low-calorie foods when there are large animals around A good analogy is if you are going to eat the same amount of meat from birds than you could from one moose the amount of time that goes into getting the birds is enormous, it is so much more effective to go after the moose\xa0 There is a problem with the anti-meat activists, people don’t understand how this could affect the Saami people\xa0 It’s always the people in the city that are trying to “be better than nature”\xa0 It’s the people that are working with nature that should be making these policies\xa0 Reindeer and moose turn leaves and pine needles into meat… you can’t grow crops there   Find Frendrik’s amazing knives and other work http://www.fredrikprost.com \xa0  BUY THE MEAT\xa0NosetoTail.org   Support me on

This episode is 7 months in the making and has a ton of interesting takeaways. We have ex-679 pound Jeff, a fruitarian college wrestler, and a woman who no joke looks like a completely different person. First, I want to talk about how I make all this content possible - support from people like you. I appreciate it so much and it’s the only way I can do this. I’m living off my savings as I try to make the Food Lies film a reality. In the meantime I’m putting out as much content as I can to get the information out there. I get messages daily from people whose lives are changing through this info, so that’s really keeping me going. You can also support me by going to http://patreon.com/peakhuman and contributing there. Members will get the extended show notes and an invite to the private Slack group. You can also preorder the film on http://Indiegogo.com/projects/food-lies-post through http://FoodLies.org - it’s still open and we still need your help. Lastly, you can check out http://NoseToTail.org where we have grass finished sustainably raised beef, buffalo, pork, lamb, and chicken for sale. We have all kinds of nose to tail products including ground beef with organ meats mixed in - which is so easy and nutrient dense, marrow bones, suet and coarse ground fat, all natural sausages, and all the normal cuts as well. It’s shipped each week to your door in a custom insulated box. Thank so much for ordering! Now more about this episode. Laura has tried every diet out there and has never found something sustainable. She lost half her body weight and looks great - people think her before and after photos are fake. Her story is inspiring and resonating with people - she went from 100 followers on Instagram when we first talked to just about 10,000 as of today! We recorded the first call in January and the 2nd call 6 months later in July. I’ll post before and after pictures of each of these guests on social media and on the podcast episode page at Peak-Human.com Next up is Jeff who lost 365 pounds by finally finding a carnivore diet. He tried every diet under the sun and nothing ever lasted. We had about 5 months in between calls as well. Last up is Mike who is a division 1 college wrestler in the middle of competing. He was convinced that a fruitarian diet was the way to go based on information he found online about our primate ancestors. Such a different story than I’ve ever heard told. Stick around for this one and hear how he changed his diet and changed his body composition and life. A quick announcement before we begin. I had some great talks with people at the Meat Up in San Diego, which was so much fun! It was packed and we even had Dr. Gary Fettke and his lovely wife Belinda in from Australia show up. They're the ones that tracked down the history of 7th day adventists and the anti-meat agenda - you can hear it on Peak Human episode 29. We also got some awesome interviews for the Food Lies film down there including the aforementioned Dr. Gary and Belinda, Nina Teicholz, Dr. Bret Scher, and Dr. Hassina Kajee. We’re finally done filming people! The countdown has begun for wrapping this up! Anyway, I also had some great talks with some developers at the Meat Up about the great need for the sapien technology we’re developing. I realized we need some help. Building tech is slow going and we’d love to build a team of like minded individuals to speed up the process and expand on the platform. Email me at brian@sapien.org if you’re interested in helping. So let’s get to it. I hope people like this new type of episode to change things up. I thought it was really interesting to hear these people’s stories so hopefully you find value in them as well. Here’s my first call with Laura Spath. \xa0 SHOW NOTES \xa0 Laura Spath  She started by posting photos of her transformation on instagram which is how I found her\xa0 At her highest weight, she weighed 263lbs\xa0 She went low-carb/keto but still had cravings for other foods\xa0 Then she went carnivore and lost a total of 120lbs\xa0 When she was on keto should relied on low-carb sweeteners and packaged foods that never allowed her to get over her cravings\xa0 Carnivore was the first time she didn’t want to cheat\xa0 She has lost substantial amount of weight before but always ended up gaining back more, but with carnivore she has been consistent\xa0 She went vegan for a year, and was having a lot more health problems\xa0 She looks very healthy now, it’s helped her acne and body composition\xa0 She doesn’t see herself adding plant foods back into her diet because of how good she feels without them\xa0 Her husband has lost 110 pounds and reversed his diabetes and high blood pressure\xa0  \xa0 Follow up with Laura  Since they last talked she is the same weight, which is a huge win because she has never found a diet that was sustainable Maintaining weight loss is a lot harder than losing weight Her body composition is improving vs losing weight on the scale She uses short-term goals to stay on track\xa0 She fears not being able to moderate herself where a cheat meal turns into a week or month\xa0 Staying strict is easier than tempting herself with moderation She had one cheat day and she gave herself no option but to get back on track and dealt with cravings for the next 2 weeks of mental cravings and stress it wasn’t worth it\xa0 Restriction gives her freedom from having to ration\xa0 Find Laura http://instagram.com/lauraespath  \xa0 Jeff\xa0  Went from weighing 679lbs to 343lbs\xa0 He got to his highest weight over the course of 30 years\xa0 He has tried every weight loss strategy and diet, he even has gastric bypass surgery\xa0 He has lost weight in the past but would always gain it back\xa0 He couldn’t continue to live as a prisoner to his body and knew he had to change The first big moment when he knew he needed to change was laying face down in the middle of the living room and couldn’t get up He now goes to the gym regularly\xa0 He started on a ketogenic diet and transitioned to a more carnivore diet and now follows a hyper-carnivore diet\xa0 He was doing ok with very-low carb/keto but when he started carnivore he dropped another 40-50 pounds in a very short period of time\xa0 The carnivore diet and his rapid weight loss triggered the formation of gallstones\xa0 The carnivore diet caused him to eat less and it was easy for him to intermittent fast\xa0 Fat shaming and loving yourself\xa0 No one is happy being fat\xa0 Love yourself enough to strive to be healthier\xa0 His biggest piece of advice: Do what works for you\xa0  \xa0 Follow up with Jeff\xa0  Had a major sugar binge on his birthday and is experiencing a terrible time physically and mentally\xa0 Weight now is 314\xa0 Scale doesn’t move as much but body composition is improving\xa0 Still on a hyper-carnivore diet\xa0 Protein is what he prefers eating because it keeps him satiating\xa0 If he was eating carbs he would always be looking for what’s next to eat\xa0 Lean meat doesn’t satiating, he has realized that he needs fat to keep him full\xa0 His advice remains the same, find something that works for you that you can stick to\xa0 He has a skin reduction surgery in the future\xa0 Find Jeff http://twitter.com/fatboybeastmode  \xa0 Mike\xa0  D1 wrestler at Rutgers University\xa0 Always had to go through periods of cutting weight so he was searching for a way to cut weight and still feel good\xa0 He started his “health” journey as a raw vegan after gaining a lot of weight after his season\xa0 He was following a very high-fruit diet\xa0 He wasn’t performing well and has aches and pains\xa0 He just started incorporating animal protein back into his diet\xa0 He lost muscle on a raw vegan diet\xa0 He felt like he always had to be eating on a raw vegan diet and that he was always bloated\xa0 Just 2 weeks of adding beef and eggs into his diet he could see more muscle definition He feels stronger now\xa0 Eating big salads ruined his performance because it was just so much food volume wise\xa0 As soon as he introduced eggs into his diet he had one of his best practices\xa0  \xa0 Follow up with Mike\xa0  He is now on a high meat diet with a little bit of fruit and vegetables\xa0 He competed on a high meat diet and placed in the top 12 out of 140 participants\xa0 His body composition has changed completely and he is way stronger now\xa0 He is deadlifting 420 with a body weight of 165 He’s noticed huge improvements with his skin and doesn’t experience eczema flare ups that he used to on a raw vegan diet\xa0 His libido has done a complete 180 The raw vegan community convinces people that their health problems are normal and makes up justifications for them\xa0 He has a lot more energy now\xa0 He doesn’t have to eat as frequently throughout the day\xa0 He likes to know both sides of the argument (vegan and carnivore) but he is much more convinced now that we should be eating meat\xa0 Find Mike http://instagram.com/mike_vanbrill  \xa0  BUY THE MEAT\xa0NosetoTail.org  Support me on

https://kylewardmusic.com/ | And we’re back from Canada with amazing footage in hand. The film tour was a huge success. I posted a bunch of stuff from Tara’s farm on Instagram that you have to check out I’m @food.lies and she is @slowdownfarmstead. It was the best food I’ve ever had in my life. All the animals and plants were grown from start to finish on her land, killed and butchered by her and her husband Troy, and cooked and prepared from scratch all the way down to the raw butter that was bright yellow and chock full of nutrients. I was full in a way I’ve never felt before. Truly an unbelievable experience.\xa0 We also were in Calgary filming at TK Ranch with the awesome Dylan Biggs. He’s doing great things on rocky, thin soil that can’t be used for anything else but cattle - who really are nature’s miracle. We also had the 2 meat-ups in Toronto - such a good time. So many great people came out and the talks were inspiring. Then there was the fat-adapted Pentathlon where I did the 5 events back to back on the track for the North, Central American and Caribbean World Masters Athletics Championship and took 2nd in my age group. I didn’t eat all day and then during the event I had a little raw liver and 2 thin slices of salami and cheese to get a little something in my stomach just in case. The last event was the 1500 and everyone was dying after a long, hot day. I had full energy still and came in 2nd overall. Maybe I would have done better if I was training instead of traveling around stuffing my face at all these events and farms. Now onto this episode which is with a great board certified internal medicine specialist and functional/root cause medicine practitioner Dr. Gary Shlifer. He’s a founding member of Sapien.org and I talked to him live from his clinic that I also work out of in Woodland Hills, California. He’s part of a new wave of doctors that see through the outdated textbooks and teachings and aren’t going to continue that standard “sick care” medical practice that doles out pills and meds and never treats underlying disease. He’s got a lot of passion and been on some big podcasts and youtube videos lately and is doing great things! We’re following in the footsteps of Virta Health and reversing tyor 2 diabetes and obesity with diet, lifestyle, and a collaborative model using technology and health coaches. You can find out more at http://Sapien.org/sapienhealth A few more things before we begin: The Meat-Up in San Diego is growing by the minute. We have special guests Dr. Paul Saladino, Alyse Parker from a couple episodes ago, William Shewfelt, Dave Feldman just freed up and is going to make it, Logan Sneed AKA Logan FusionLean, and now the great Dr. Ken Berry. We’ll all be at Queenstown Public House wednesday night July 24th. RSVP at NoseToTail.org/event It’s going to be awesome! It’s the night before the Low Carb USA conference starts. If anyone wants last minute tickets message me on social media and I’ll give you a coupon code for 20% off. You can also find the nose to tail meats on that site NoseToTail.org where we have grass finished ground beef with grass finished organ meats mixed in. One which has about 30% liver, heart, kidney, and spleen, and one with about 5% of those organs. There’s so many other delicious and nutritious things there like bone marrow bones, bone broth, beef and buffalo bacon, high omega 3 pork and chicken, omega 3 ground pork with organ meats mixed in, lamb, and buffalo. Just check it out. It’s all delivered to you each week as long as you’re in the contiguous 48 US states.

NOTES  We are live in person with Dr. Gary in his clinic in Woodland Hills in Los Angeles He’s my business partner at http://Sapien.org and has had his own private practice for 3 years now while also working in hospitals around LA He practices root cause medicine, functional medicine, or whatever you want to call the better way of doing things instead of just slinging medications and treating symptoms like many mainstream doctors You invest a lot of time and money into medical school, it makes it hard to accept that there are things you learn about medicine health care should be questioned\xa0 It’s scary for doctors to go against big organizations like the American Diabetes Association\xa0 My content challenged the foundational knowledge of what Gary was taught in medical school and what triggered him to question what he had learned There is more and more anecdotal “science” surfacing that allows us to question what nutritional science tells us, for example the carnivore diet [15:12] In order to prove to a modern day American that we shouldn’t be eating processed foods we need a randomized placebo control study, you should just need common sense\xa0 Everyone who has stuck to our SAPIEN diet has found that the overall benefits extend so much further than weight loss\xa0 In just 50-60 years of misinformation people are disconnected from what food should really look like Gary grew up eating foods like pate, caviar, and liver and onions and when he moved to America, he was almost convinced that he shouldn’t be eating these foods but now he is grateful that his upbringing allowed him to have an open mind\xa0 When we go against human nature, eating fake foods and avoiding the sun, we get these illnesses Animal foods are the heart of our nutrition [19:57] and plants are no longer fallback foods, we don’t need fallback foods, we can’t pretend that a cucumber or bell pepper is healthier than a steak\xa0 If an alien looked down on human’s they would think we are nuts for going from eating nutrient dense animal foods to a plant-based diet\xa0 [27:43] In medical school, there is a huge focus on basic science, disease management, you don’t learn a lot of practical information or how to actually help people and you do not learn nutrition [28:01] He learned all the science behind metabolism and macronutrients, but they never connected that to food\xa0 Doctors don’t deal with nutrition, you just refer to the dietician or nutritionist\xa0 In the 4 years of medical school, you don’t learn anything about food and nutrition All of the medical dietary recommendations are anchored in very little research that doctors get attached to Gary’s passion for end of life care [34:31] The doctors have to listen to the hospital administrators and if you fight back, you are at risk of losing your job, license, being sued, etc.\xa0 Story of Gary prescribing a low-carb diet in a hospital to a diabetic patient and the hospital giving him the “low-carb” option which was a cheese burger with a bun and baked potato with all the fixings, given to the patient by the hospital’s nutritionist\xa0 Gary was given the tools to keep sick people alive but not take care of the general population Gary has seen doctors held to the fear of legal retribution and not do the best thing for the patient because of this Gary became very vocal about whole-foods, low-carb diets in his practice and he also had his own transformation too and people were interested in what he was doing\xa0 He knew he had an uphill battle when his highly educated peers didn’t understand that carbohydrates and sugars were contributing to poor health outcomes Gary cleans up other doctor’s mess, who are on countless drugs and have been given no meaningful dietary recommendations, and many are put on a plant-based diet\xa0 The archaic ideas around saturated fat and cholesterol and plant-based diets\xa0 [55:11] He has had his patients reverse his diabetes and other doctors tell them that they need a new doctor because he is recommending a SAPIEN diet which is high in animal fats despite them getting healthier\xa0 [56:54] Patients are very confused about what to eat, and people are basically eating dessert for breakfast\xa0 The SAPIEN diet is what humans should eat in the context of modern day America from an ancestral point of view with the addition of modern science The three pillars of the SAPIEN diet Pillar one: focus on protein, embrace fat, and minimize carbs Pillar two: nutrient dense whole foods Pillar three: condensed eating window\xa0 We are building technology to help patients adhere to these diet and lifestyle changes and connect patients to doctors and health coaches\xa0 Packaged foods have destroyed any innate food culture of our ancestors\xa0 We can’t accept that these fake foods are not part of a healthy diet, they are treats\xa0   \xa0 Where to find Dr. Gary Shlifer: Contact us at www.SAPIEN.org\xa0 Instagram:

everyone. I didn’t want to release this as a podcast but hey, why not? I had some of the superheroes of meat eating in one film studio, so I had to take advantage of this opportunity to let everyone hear the audio version. You’ll see this on the big screen - in Food Lies and maybe even other places someday. We shot it in our production studio which belongs to my Sapien.org business partner who is producing Food Lies with me. To set the scene a bit, it’s a large warehouse and we were sitting in the middle on director chairs with 3 cameras filming. We hit 7 main topics based around meat. We started off high level for a general audience to ease in - why should meat be included as a part of a healthy diet? We went all the way into details of a carnivore diet and should it be nose to tail or just steak and eggs? We also talked about how much plant food we should include in our diet. I always include some - and Mark Sisson used to recommend including a lot - seems like things are changing though... So I definitely agree with the nose to tail meat-eating approach - so much so that I named my grass finished meat company after it. We have grass finished beef, buffalo, and lamb, as well as pasture raised pork and chicken. Our pork and chicken has been tested in an independent lab and has one of the best omega 6 to omega 3 ratios around. It’s around 1.5 to 1 which is amazing! Most conventionally raised pork is 20:1 and conventionally raised chicken about 24:1. You can see the results on NoseToTail.org and also place an order. It’s shipped out to all 48 contiguous US states each week on Monday and Tuesday. We also have ground beef, buffalo, and pork with organ meats mixed in. You get liver, heart, kidney, and spleen all grass finished and all mixed in so you barely taste it.\xa0 If you can’t support me in this way, you can join the Patreon and get the extended show notes for the podcast each week at http://Pateron.com/peakhuman and get invited to the private slack group while also keeping the show ad-free. We’re in the final days of filming for Food Lies. People keep asking me when it will be released and unfortunately I don’t know. We’ve been editing it for months and keep finding great new experts and stories to add. The world is changing by the day as well and it’s hard to find a cutoff for what content to include in the film. Do we include the news that there’s glyphosate in the Beyond Meat burgers? What about Miki Ben-Dor’s latest study on human evolution and meat eating? Anyway, it’s close to being finished but we still need to do a ton of graphics to illustrate all of these points and make these big concepts easier to understand - so it will take some time.\xa0 We just got back from an incredible film tour in Calgary, Toronto, and Ottawa. Some awesome farmers and ranchers doing some great things for the land, the animals, and dispelling vegan propaganda. So much of the land on earth just isn't suitable for crops, yet works perfectly for cattle and other ruminant animals. Anti-meat activists are so clueless when it comes to this, it’s a real shame. We’re about to head out for the very last shoots in San Diego July 24th-27th based around the Low Carb USA conference. Some great doctors will be in town that we’ll be getting in the film. Come say hi - I’ll be at the conference a bit. We’ll also have our Meat-Up there on Wednesday July 24th in downtown san diego with Dr. Paul Saladino and ex-vegan turned carnivore Alyse Parker from the last episode. RSVP at http://NoseToTail.org/event Can’t wait to see everyone there!

Human evolution and brain development relating to meat eating\xa0 Bioavailable nutrients\xa0 Where did we go wrong if we’ve been eating meat for all of history? Agriculture “was the worst mistake in human history” Our brain sizes have shrunk since agriculture We can survive on grains, but can we thrive? Fallback foods Are we eating the same meat as we did in the past? What about fruits and vegetables in the past? We’ve been eating meat in the same basic form for 2 million years yet plants are very new Only consistent food we’ve had for history has been animals Mark has always said “make half your plate plants” does he still believe this? You don’t need the amount of calories you may think to still thrive and not be hungry\xa0 Are the RDAs relevant to those who don’t eat a bunch of carbs, sugar, and processed foods? Our nutrition guidelines are based on a bad diet Diet is turning into religion Much of our nutrition info is based on poorly conducted observational studies There is no nuance in nutrition reporting\xa0 People eating the most meat in Asia have the longest life Replacing animal products always equates to processed versions that make food companies a lot of money\xa0 What should the ratio of plant to animal foods be? What is the definition of an ideal diet? We need all the vitamins and minerals in the most bioavailable form with the least amount of toxins America eats 70% plant foods in our diet Peoples health improve as they eat more animals foods in many cases Do people really need a whole bunch of bulky fiberous plants? No benefit of fiber - where did this myth come from? Healthy user bias\xa0 Vegetarian benefits go away when you control for people who also have healthy behaviors\xa0 Meat is a status symbol in Asia\xa0 Should we be eating Nose to Tail, or is it ok to just eat steak and burger patties? Organ meats provide all the necessary vitamins and minerals Our ancestors ate Nose to Tail and even did this as little as 100 years ago, but we find it weird today\xa0 Animals eat the organs and fat and many times leave the muscle meat Shawn Baker does not believe the organ meats are necessary but agrees they are nutrient dense and are great\xa0 Mark Sisson wants to live an awesome life and enjoy every bite of food Solve for the highest quality of life at all times People maybe shouldn’t focus on tiny things that make maybe 1% difference\xa0 We shouldn’t have to use trackers to figure out how to eat and sleep\xa0 Eating a species appropriate diet should be intuitive\xa0 I think Nose to Tail eating was natural and intuitive\xa0 Tastes are cultural What about meat eating and longevity? mTor and igf-1\xa0 Muscle mass and long life Carbs signal insulin more than animal protein\xa0 Healthy diets are more about what you don’t eat Closing statements\xa0   \xa0  BUY THE MEAT\xa0NosetoTail.org  Support me on Patreon! http://patreon.com/peakhuman\xa0  Preorder the film here: http://indiegogo.com/projects/food-lies-post  \xa0  Film site: http://FoodLies.org  YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/FoodLies  Sapien Movement: http://SapienMovement.com  \xa0  Follow along:  http://twitter.com/FoodLiesOrg  http://instagram.com/food.lies  http://facebook.com/FoodLiesOrg  \xa0  Theme music by https://kylewardmusic.com/", 'chan_desc': "Peak Human is a curated audio series taking an unbiased look at health & nutrition.

I asked him how being a father has changed his life, he gives a great response! Mike is one of the top nutrition coaches in the state and delivers amazing client results.

First part we recapped our amazing trip to San Jose to hang with the Mind Pump crew. We then jumped into the Q & A. We talked about everything from the most impactful thing anyone has ever said to me, to battling postpartum depression and anxiety, to the type of carbohydrates used in a cut and much, much more.

A top 5 downloaded podcast with over 2.5 million downloads per month. It was such an amazing honor to have Adam on the show. There was much value provided in this episode, I would be selling you short trying to summarize it. Trust me, give it a listen! Adam's bio is listed below. \xa0 Adam Schafer - Mind Pump In the midst of his childhood turmoil, one constant in Adam’s life was his love for sports. He was a natural athlete who loved snowboarding, water skiing, basketball and anything else sports related. Adam’s love for sports led him down the path of learning about fitness and nutrition. Adam got started with his career in fitness in 2001.\xa0 As a part of his ongoing quest to learn and grow in his career Adam has obtained certifications from top fitness training institutions including the International Fitness Professionals Association, the National Academy of Sports Medicine, the National Council on Strength and Fitness, and the National Exercise and Sports Trainers Association. Adam also prioritizes his own fitness and worked diligently to become an IFBB Men's Physique Pro which allows him to compete as a professional bodybuilder. Early in his career Adam discovered that he loved to train and teach others. He has worked with over 1,000 people as a trainer and fitness expert and deeply values the lessons he has learned from clients. In addition to training clients one-on-one Adam has also led boot camps, provided nutrition consulting, and helped other trainers improve their sales and leadership skills. Adam has found a way to train and teach even more people through Mind Pump. Adam found that combining his passion and expertise with that of Sal, Justin, and Doug gives him the opportunity to make a big impact on the fitness industry. He hopes to change it for the better and bridge the gap between wellness and performance.

She is not dogmatic on any one approach being the best for a client. She educated us on how to properly use Keto, and why throwing in carbs can be such a valuable tool. We also talked about Tara's personal story, which was deep and meaningful, to say the least. Her journey of leaving a religion she was very involved in, her thoughts on plant medicine and redefining herself after having four kids and a divorce.

In this episode, we\'ll go over how to land in this feel-good place, where you break free of thinking about weight loss all the time, and yet still choose food like you care about yourself. You CAN lose the obsession with your weight and still give a damn about what you eat. And it feels incredibly good to do so!\xa0 | Why do I binge eat?\xa0Why don\'t other people develop this same habit?\xa0And most importantly, what needs to change so I can STOP?\xa0We answer these questions and more in this episode of the Breaking Up With Binge Eating podcast. (Plus there\'s a special announcement on how to fast track your success).\xa0Binge eating is a cycle. It is most commonly initiated and continued because of two factors:\xa0Physical drivers\xa0Emotional driversIn this episode we\'ll talk about how individuals vary in their personal "fingerprint". You own struggles might be mostly due to #1, mostly #2, or a solid mix of both. Regardless, there is a way to meet your needs better, and we\'ll show you how.\xa0 | At some point, you\'ll have to tackle an urge to binge eat. In fact, you\'ll probably need to face urges many time during your recovery. In this episode you\'ll learn our 3 part method for exactly what to do as soon as you notice you are experiencing an urge.\xa0 | It happens. Slip ups are not the end of the world, but if you do binge, you\'ll need to know how to get back on track without extending our suffering! In this episode we\'ll talk about the do\'s (practice self-compassion, get back to your normal schedule) and don\'ts (beat yourself up, isolate yourself, skip meals, or keep bingeing/restricting) for getting back on your feet.\xa0 | In this episode you\'ll hear a detailed, personal account from someone who has been in your shoes. You\'ll hear the key lessons learned by a real life client as she worked to free herself from binge eating. Her story is inspiring, heartwarming, and encouraging.\xa0 | Emotional skill development is being uncovered as one of the crucial pieces to successfully treating and preventing eating problems. Without it, people simply don’t get better, or they get better for a short time and relapse when life gets hard again. Sadly, few weight management programs and “experts” use these skills in their treatment approach, opting instead to focus on food, food, food. If your personal history includes being given food directions, diet programs, and eating advice ad nauseam, yet no direction on how how skillfully deal with your feelings, you deserve better! Let it fuel your hope that you can and will get better - you just haven\'t been given the right tools before. And today, that starts changing.\xa0 | Clients often ask Maryclaire and I, “What are the usual signs that someone is making progress overcoming binge eating?" It makes sense; of course we want to know how we are doing! If you have wondered this too, perfect, because we’re getting right to those signposts in today’s episode. \xa0 | Megan thought she could bring an apple in her backpack, but to lose weight she heard snacking between meals was a bad idea. But she knew her main goal wasn’t weight loss, it was to not binge. So… should she snack or no?She began to fill with dread. Her chest tightened."You ok?" Her boyfriend asked. "You looked so happy a few minutes ago, but all of a sudden you look … miserable."\xa0 If you can relate to Megan’s stress, you’re not alone. Today’s show is all about answering that crucial question: “If my main goal is not to binge, how often should I be eating?” | Crying in dressing rooms. Afraid to go to a formal dinner. Never going to the beach. Body hatred can be cruel, and it\'s something most people have felt at least once in their lives. But we don\'t have to feel it in the future.This episode is for anyone out there who has ever felt not good looking enough.\xa0In it, you\'ll hear how you aren\'t alone, plus we\'ll share tactics for shifting your perspective on your body\'s role in your life. We\'ll give you some concrete steps you can use to begin a friendlier new relationship with your body.\xa0 | Many people who come to Nutrition Loft wanting to permanently stop binge eating also want to be thinner. And they want to get right down to business seeing the pounds head for the hills. \xa0But the expert in us coaches knows better and today, we’ll explore why we need to start with something that is NOT weight loss to free someone from binge eating, and in the long run, end their weight problems. Along the way, we\'ll talk about why dieting and weight control efforts so often backfire by worsening binge eating disorder.\xa0 We\'ll also explore how changing how you think about your choices can make weight loss possible down the road.\xa0', 'chan_desc': "Binge eating and emotional eating keep millions of people from living their best lives.

Ever since I was a young kid, I wanted to be a “strong man”.\xa0In high school, I was the starting runningback for my football team, and led the county in rushing yards. I then went on to receive my bachelor’s degree from Columbia University in 2004, where I was a member of the football team and a three-time Dean’s List recipient. After college, I pursued my Master’s of Science in Human Performance from the University of Florida, where I worked with the national championship men’s basketball team, along with women’s basketball, tennis, and golf programs. I then went on to become the Strength & Conditioning coordinator for VCU basketball, helping the Rams win the 2007 conference championship and making it to the second round of the NCAA tournament. To read a Richmond Times Dispatch article on my approach, click here.\xa0I have been out of collegiate Strength & Conditioning for almost a decade, but I have continued to compete in sports such as crossfit, powerlifting, half marathons, and now rowing. In June of 2016 I discovered the ketogenic lifestyle and I never looked back. I found so many benefits within a week of switching, that I knew this would be my new way of life. Inflammation and injuries from years of playing on turf and beating myself up with heavy lifting were gone. I regained control over my hunger and found a mental clarity and increase in productivity that I had never experienced before. In August of 2017, after over a year of dipping their toes in the water, our two boys joined us. Desmond, our eldest, felt an immediate increase in energy and improvement in his allergies and asthma. Dean, our youngest, has had astounding improvements in his eczema and mood. Our children are immune to cravings. It has been an amazing thing to see. We thought our kids were “picky” just like most kids supposedly are; keto changed their taste buds and now they crave real, nourishing food like the recipes you will find on this PDF. Best of all, they do not feel restricted in any way!We understand that transitioning the family can be challenging, so we hope this blog helps you conveniently transition your entire family to a low carb lifestyle so that you, too, can experience all of the profound benefits we have!Maura Vega:\xa0I’m Maura Vega, or as many of you know me, Fat Fueled Mom. I grew up in Miami, Florida, and was a dancer for most of my life until I graduated high school. I was classically trained in ballet, jazz, and contemporary. I competed throughout high school winning multiple team and individual awards. I found my love for fitness once I graduated high school and started college. Unfortunately for me (a curvy latin girl), the body type that was in style back then was tall and thin. Being a dancer, there was always focus around the way I looked and I always longed to have that tall and thin figure. I’ve been dieting since high school and it has been quite the battle over the years. Eating disorders and body dysmorphia have plagued me for as long as I can remember. I’ve experimented with vegetarian, paleo, and IIFYM. It wasn’t until I found the ketogenic lifestyle that I was finally able to heal my body and repair my metabolism, as well as my mind and my relationship with food.I started Keto in June of 2016. After a 2 year battle with Postpartum Depression after the birth of my youngest, I knew I had to make a change. I was eager to get off medications and I knew that the ketogenic lifestyle was my only hope. I have now been keto for almost 2 years and I’m happy to say that not only have my depression symptoms been drastically reduced, my anxiety has also improved, I feel the best I’ve ever felt and it continues to get better. Seeing how impactful this lifestyle can be on our bodies, I decided to help transition my children to this healthy way of life in hopes that it would relieve them of some of the ailments they had. I now eat for health and performance, and I never feel deprived. I haven’t binged or restricted food since I started back in June of 2016.Our boys have now been keto for a little over 8 months and I’m happy to report that not only has my oldest found relief from his asthma and allergies, but we’ve also witnessed a major improvement in our little one’s mood and eczema. They are still kids, so they have treats at birthday parties and special occasions; we don’t want them to feel left out. However, we have seen how powerful keto is at fixing broken relationships with food. Our oldest rarely is phased by treats he passes by; he truly does not crave them. My little one spit out half of his Halloween candy last year because he didn’t like it. It is absolutely amazing to see these changes in my children, knowing that I’m setting them up for a lifetime of success.\xa0I’m so happy that my family and I have found this amazing way of life. With our Fat Fueled Family blog, we hope to spread our love for keto to other families who have the same goals for their family by making it fun and easy!\xa0We hope you enjoy our content, and we look forward to sharing our family’s journey with all of you!\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'Jessica Tye is a Nutritional Therapy Practitioner specializing in helping people achieve positive results through education and advising clients about food.

What about a delicious café brunch on Sunday morning? I know I do! It\'s certainly not something I\'m prepared to give up, and we shouldn\'t feel like we have to. A healthy lifestyle doesn\'t mean 100% clean, calorie controlled eating.In fact, my philosophy is that, to achieve overall health and wellbeing, you need foods that nourish your soul (what I call "soul foods") in moderation. But, at the end of the day, food is energy for your body and when you\'re in these social situations it is very easy to ingest much more energy than your body actually needs at the time, and undo a lot of the \'healthy eating\' you achieved throughout the week.\xa0So how do we stay on track without sacrificing our soul foods? Well, in today\'s podcast I give you all my tried and tested tips and tricks that I have developed over the 9 years I have been practicing as a nutritionist and dietitian.

If you are going to act on advice that could affect your health or wellbeing, that advice should be backed by robust and well designed research that demonstrates its effectiveness.

We talk about the effects of food additives on IBS and the gut microbiome more generally. We discuss the current efficacy of the emerging concept of personalised nutrition. Megan takes us through the latest research relating to the effects of probiotics and in what circumstances they may be helpful. We talk about the emerging understanding of the link between gut health and mental health through the gut-brain axis. We debunk the myths relating to "leaky gut" and explain exactly what it is and how it relates to\xa0coeliac disease. We chat about the latest research coming out about the connection between gut health, weight management and women\'s health. We talk truths about the effects of alcohol and dairy on gut health. Megan also gives you her tips on how to include beans, legumes and chickpeas into your diet if you suffer from wind and bloating. Finally, Megan and I talk IBS, misconceptions about the low FODMAP diet and the emerging evidence relating to non-dietary, holistic ways of managing IBS.\xa0If you enjoyed this podcast, please tag us and share it in your Insta stories and leave me a positive rating or review in the purple Apple Podcast app (in the rating & reviews section underneath the episode lists).

Michelle is an Accredited Practising Dietitian and Sports Dietitian with a specialty in eating behaviours. Buckle up, because Michelle and I are taking a deep dive into the huge role psychology, thoughts and behavioural change plays in our practice as dietitians. In addition to her dietetics qualifications, Michelle has an undergraduate degree in psychology, so don’t worry… #wegotthequals. Advertising, social media, magazines, etc. place so much importance on what we eat (Is it sugar free?… Is it fat free?… How many calories?…). But at the end of the day, when it comes to achieving health and weight loss goals, an equally important question is ‘Why am I eating what I’m eating?’. To this end, Michelle and I discuss how important behaviour recognition and change is for sustaining long lasting health. We discuss the common behaviours and habits that hold our clients back from maintaining a healthy weight and how we work with our clients to recognise and change those habits and behaviours. Spoiler alert, the biggest tip we have is EAT MORE VEGGIES, so we discuss smart ways to work more of them into your diet... #guthealth. We give you strategies to combat those pesky night time sugar cravings. We give you the goods when it comes to combating workplace cultures or social events that put pressure on you to eat and drink.

So don\'t worry, between the two of us we have the qualifications to give you the frank and fearless facts on fat loss in an industry that is just soaking in BS.We start with the best way to track fat loss and how to avoid the scale mind f#%k. We talk about the basic things people tend to get wrong when it comes to losing weight and how to manage expectations (i.e. what is realistic progress when it comes to fat loss). We move on to the problems with rapid fat loss and metabolic adaptations and touch on the importance of behaviour (i.e. how the little things can add up). We discuss intuitive eating as the holy grail of sustainable weight management but we also touch on how macro and calorie tracking works for some people (at the end of the day it really comes down to you). Finally we talk about how to deal with the mixed messages bombarding you from every corner of the fitness industry and why, like most things in life, there is no black and white answers when it comes to fat loss and overall health (despite what many social medial "health professionals" would have you believe). Please be warned, there are a few sneaky F-bombs in this podcast so if you have little ears in the car please be mindful of this.\xa0If you enjoyed this podcast, please leave me a positive rating or review in the purple Apple Podcast app (in the rating & reviews section underneath the episode lists).

It can help harness great power in our communities, but in today\'s world we are too often letting dietary differences shift us into polarized positions. Food is far too important to let buzzwords lead the conversation. And while misinformation may be unintentional, disinformation is deliberate and manipulative. In order to engage in more productive conversations, we need to 1) learn to listen better in order to find common ground, 2) employ storytelling to share important information and create a sense of wonder, and 3) be truly respectful of others’ thoughts and feelings.

Similarly, for me and all the women I work with inside of my programs, their first diet was strictly focused on being in a smaller body. That is to say, we dieted for aesthetic reasons, not health. As women, we do not want to diet. Instead, we want to be in a thinner body. Our modern society believes that being thinner is better, smarter, and healthier. In other words, all of us have been taught at a very young age that health = thinness but is it true or is it just an assumption? What if health wasn’t the outcome of the weight on the scale? Would you still want to diet? Does “Obesity” Cause One to Be Unhealthy? As of today in October 2019, there isn’t one study or research evidence that directly points to being overweight (BMI-based status) as a causative factor in diseases. That said, many studies will link/correlate obesity to health risks. In other words, weight status is never the sole factor in any health condition. In this groundbreaking research on BMI and metabolic health, one-third to three-quarters of people classified as obese were metabolically healthy. Four health factors were measured and evaluated to achieve health status. These include blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and plasma glucose. Moreover, when BMI categorized an individual as obese, this study showed that obesity did not affect the risks of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and mortality. However, it did increase diabetes risk although cumulative incidence remained low in healthy people. In fact, the problem with considering weight as the main factor to your health is our inability to lose weight and sustain the weight loss. Hence, 95-98% of dieters regain all of their weight loss within 1-5 years.\xa0 Dr. Traci Mann, a UCLA associate professor of psychology and lead author of this study said, “We found that the majority of people regained all the weight, plus more. Sustained weight loss was found only in a small minority of participants, while complete weight regain was found in the majority. Diets do not lead to sustained weight loss or health benefits for the majority of people.”. Is Health Beyond Dieting Possible? The short answer is yes. Based on research, it would appear that health isn’t attributed to the weight on the scale, therefore, we can say that health is possible without seeking weight loss. A 2016 study by researchers at UCLA published in the International Journal of Obesity looked at 40,420 adults in the most recent U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. It assessed their health as measured by six accepted metrics (not including BMI). The metrics include blood pressure, triglyceride, cholesterol, glucose, insulin resistance, and C-reactive protein. It found that 47 percent of people were classified as overweight by BMI. Twenty-nine percent of those who qualified as obese were healthy as measured by at least five of those other metrics. Meanwhile, 31 percent of normal-weight people were unhealthy by two or more of the same measures. So, if weight isn’t what ensures our long-term health, then what is? Studies that have actually controlled for fitness have found that it is more predictive for mortality than weight. This study defined ‘fit’ as 3-4 hrs/week of walking. In this episode, we will cover how we can as women seek health beyond dieting and weight loss. Likewise, we will explore everything we can do today that can and will impact our health long term.

The word "coaching" is an identified process used to transport people from where they are to where they want to be. It\'s a form of development, a process of supporting someone towards a goal. Self-coaching is when we become our own coach. We know what’s best for us. That’s the innate wisdom we all have. The same wisdom that directs our hunger and fullness cues within the framework of intuitive eating. This innate wisdom is how we are the expert in our own life. Self-Coaching and Intuitive Eating Intuitive eating is the process to learn how to tap in the innate wisdom of our body to know what, when, and how much to eat. Tap into this innate wisdom that all of us have to feed ourselves. Intuitive Eating is a proven and well-researched self-care eating framework that makes YOU the boss of YOU. Intuitive eating teaches us to have a healthy relationship with food empowering you to trust your ability to meet your needs, distinguish between physical and emotional hungers and ultimately developing your connection with your innate body wisdom. My mentor, Evelyn Tribole says it best: Intuitive eating is making YOU the Boss of You. Intuitive eating is the process of learning to self-coach around food. With time and practice of intuitive eating, you become the boss of your own life. On today’s episode, you’ll learn to self-coach toward intuitive eating. I’ll teach you a framework to coaching yourself.

That was the title of episode 101 of The Beyond The Food Show Podcast in which I shared my in-depth personal story for the first time. I asked one of my friends Sean Croxton to interview me. I gave him carte blanche... the result was amazing. My Story 1.0 As a public figure, I had shared my origin story in occasion before mainly inside my programs or during my public workshop but never to this level of vulnerability of this interview. Certainly, I remember being very anxious before, during, and after the recording. But the greatest gift came a few days after the interview when it hit me: I no longer need to hide my imperfections, my mistakes, my errors. That is to say, although I was scared of what people would say, the relief of being completely transparent was by far greater. From Shame to Fame episode 101 of our Intuitive Eating podcast was just another chapter in my story... She\'s Beyond the Food: My Life Story From that interview, I gradually became more confident in sharing the events in my life that brought me to the greatest learning. To synthesize the failure into learning. To process the lowest points in my life into inspiring stories that support my life’s teaching. She’s Beyond The Food podcast episode series was born in March 2019 with Chapter 1 when I shared my business struggle. I shared with the audience how I faced a business failure and how I changed this event. It was by far one of the most well-received episodes because of the vulnerability I was willing to express and share. The lesson here: the teacher teaches best when not perfect. So, I decided to build upon this impactful episode and released:  Episode 183-Chapter 2: I shared my life long struggle with exercise Episode 187-Chapter 3: I shared my journey quitting Keto Episode 190-Chapter 4: My experience gaining weight in public eyes Episode 195–Chapter 5: My journey in accepting my body  She\'s Beyond the Food Chapter 6 Today’s episode is about She’s Beyond The Food Chapter 6-it’s my story 2.0. It’s a follow up to episode 101 From Shame to Fame in which I shared 7 lessons learned from my experienced life up to now. The stories that made me who I’m today. The stories that crafted the Going Beyond The Food Method.  Lesson 1: Weight stigma is real and freaking powerful Lesson 2: Diet Culture is a powerful monster but it’s optional Lesson 3: Repeat or evolve… my choice. Lesson 4: It’s Beyond the Food Lesson 5: Wellness Diet & healthy body Lesson 6: You can’t hate yourself to happiness or health Lesson 7: Intuitive Eating: gateway to health & happiness  Life happens to me or for me One of the biggest lessons I shared in this episode is the shift that I had to do in my late thirties where I stopped looking at life happening to me but instead life happening for me. I spent 25 years believing that I was the victim of the external circumstances and that life was working against me. In other words, I was in the victim mindset... That victim mindset kept me going in circle for 25 years chasing one diet after another and with every failure I was angrier at the world and resentful of my life. In fact, I lost and gain large amounts of weight at least 12 times never learning anything from each failure but instead repeating the same formula the next time. And then one day, every part of me collapsed. I hit my rock bottom and was forced to look at myself and my life from a different perspective. With faith and coaching, I gradually shifted to a mindset of “Life happens for me, not to me”. I began the process of asking myself: What can I learn from this event? What is this person trying to teach me? With every question came learning, growth, and transformation. I took back my power and my life. I shifted to being in charge of my life instead of being the victim of life. Are you willing to be uncomfortable? Knowing what I know today, what I’ve learned from my lessons and my teachers is that what was holding me back in the victim mindset, the life-happens-to-me-not-for-me mindset, was the unwillingness to be uncomfortable. When you shift to being empowered, one thing becomes clear really quickly... things will get uncomfortable. Why? Simply because you have no one else to blame but you! You see when you assume full responsibility, you must be willing to be uncomfortable. The willingness to be uncomfortable is what kept me stuck for 25 years but at the same time crafted the most beautiful journey for my life. It’s also what keeps some of my students from transforming when they start feeling discomfort, they disappear and go back to their comfort zone. I hope that today’s episode She’s Beyond The Food Chapter 6 - My story 2.0 inspires you to begin the process of writing your own story. Of asking yourself “What is there for me to learn in this event? What is this person trying to teach me? \xa0 Mentioned on the show: Get Started with our FREE Intuitive Eating Introduction Course October 2019 Intuitive Eating Project Registration Podcast Episode 101 \xa0  |  On today\'s episode, we\'ll talk about cyclical living If our body is wise enough to know what to eat, when to eat and how to eat... what else can it do for us?\xa0 What else can we learn from our womanly body? According to a\xa0study from the Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics, fluctuations of hormones over the monthly menstrual cycle play a crucial role in our emotional status, appetite, thought processes, and so much more. Women reported high levels of well-being and self-esteem during the middle of the cycle in the study. Increased feelings of anxiety, hostility, and depression were reported before their period. Cyclical Living Our egg wisdom is perhaps for us women another expression of our innate body wisdom. When I say egg wisdom, I’m referring to the wisdom of our female cycle. This wisdom that is our female cycle is wise enough to create life from… an egg and a sperm. What else can it do for us? Over the last year, I became really acquainted with my female cycle and discovered a whole new world of intuition. The more I got familiar with how my body spoke to me through my cycle the more I realized that this is the extension of intuitive eating and also body neutrality.  Source: Cycle Synching Body Neutrality & Cycle Synching Body neutrality teaches us to engage with our body as a whole and be grateful for all that it does for us... to care for our body. To build a relationship of trust and respect with our body and for all that it does for us. As women, having a relationship with our cycle is part of body neutrality. Cycling is an exponential opportunity for us to connect with our body at a much deeper level. It’s no secret that at different stages of our cycle, we look, feel, and act differently. Observing our cycles and all that it creates in our bodies allows us to gather information and fully comprehend how symbiotic we are as women. Intuitive Eating & Cyclical Living Intuitive eating\xa0requires us to shift from external cues to internal cues when it comes to eating and health. To eat intuitively, we need to be able to connect with our innate body wisdom just like with cyclical living. Intuitive eating teaches us that we have this innate ability to know how to nourish our bodies via our intuition... what else can we learn from our intuitive food decision? In my opinion, there’s a deep connection between cyclical living and intuitive eating. The stepping stone to eating intuitively is to develop interoception, this ability to feel and tap into our internal body cues. In the case of intuitive eating, these cues are hunger, fullness, and satisfaction.\xa0Practicing cyclical living will enhance your ability to be an intuitive eater. On today’s episode, Kate Northrup, an entrepreneur, bestselling author, speaker, and mother is going to teach us how to tap into the wisdom of our cycle to do less and improve our self-worth. Kate has built a digital empire and is committed to supporting ambitious women to light up the world without burning themselves out in the process.\xa0 What you’ll learn listening to episode 205 of the Going Beyond The Food podcast:  How we’ve learned to seek self-worth externally\xa0 The impact of patriarchal society on women\'s self-worth Why seeking self-worth externally is a forever never-ending loop\xa0 What is cyclical living and how you can implement it in your life The deep connection between our cycle wisdom and body image How to connect Intuitive Eating and cyclical living  Mentioned on the show: Get Started with our FREE Intuitive Eating Introduction Course Get Kate\'s Book The Secret Pleasure of Menopause Rebecca Campbell Rise sister rise \xa0  Connect with our Guest Website Instagram Facebook |  \xa0 On today\'s episode, we\'ll talk about the BE DO HAVE formula for success That you want to change your health habits, stop overeating or make peace with your body, HOW you go about the process of transformation will determine your success. The process that most of us have been thought to apply when wanting to create something new in our life has been the DO HAVE BE model. In order to BE successful, for example, we need to first DO the things that HAVE the Success. When we DO enough of the “things, we hope to be rewarded by finally BEING successful. DO BE HAVE in health transformation Take the example of the goal of being happy & healthy for women in today’s society. We are taught that in order for us, women to be happy and healthy, must HAVE thinness. We must fit in the proper BMI and have the “normal thin” body. In order for us to have the thin & a proper BMI body, we must DO diets (control food and / or exercise). When we have thinness and proper BMI, we will be rewarded by being healthy and happy. Normal right? Perhaps normal to society standards but not right. The problem is that it doesn’t work... I mean 95% of diets fail and dieters regain the weight which means that 95% of the population doesn’t have access to health and happiness? DO HAVE BE keeps us stuck That model DO HAVE BE keeps us stuck in a state of depression, fear, guilt, and shame which leads us straight to a repeated cycle of failure. The results are that we are forever chasing health and happiness, but never getting “there”. You’ve been there and perhaps are still there. I know I was for nearly 25 years. Stuck in a forever state of personal failure when it came to my weight, body, and food habits. But it wasn’t my fault just like it’s not yours either. I was never taught how to actually create personal success in my life. I knew how to create success when it came to business and money but not personal behaviors. BE DO HAVE model is the solution To be successful with human personal transformation, we must instead apply the Be Do Have model. What is the difference between DO HAVE BE versus DO BE HAVE? In order to HAVE what you want, something that you currently do not have, you are going to have to do things you haven’t done before. You\'re going to have to do things differently. In order to DO the things you haven’t done before, you are going to have to BE someone you haven’t been before. In this podcast episode, we will teach the most effective way of making changes in your health: The Be Do Have formula. What you’ll learn today:  Why we self-sabotage on our way towards our goals Why self-criticism doesn’t work as a means of motivation DO HAVE BE versus BE DO HAVE 3 steps toward any goal achievement using BE DO HAVE approach  Mentioned on the show: Get Started with our FREE Intuitive Eating Introduction Course Free Workshop to discover the Academy  Academy Register directly for the Academy \xa0  |  On today\'s episode, we\'ll talk about the perfectionist paradigm shift Do you struggle in creating new long-lasting habits in your life? Particularly around food and health? Maybe it’s exercise: you pay your new subscription to the gym with excitement and enthusiasm and plan to go 5 days a week before work. Yet 6 weeks later, you’re not going to the gym anymore and your brain is going crazy with very self-critical thoughts as to why you once again failed yourself and all the things that are wrong with you. Is that you? That was me until I learned to shift my paradigm about perfection. Perfectionist, is that you? The perfectionist is a personality trait characterized by a person\'s striving for flawlessness and setting high-performance standards, accompanied by critical self-evaluations and concerns regarding others\' evaluations. Is that an accurate description of you? Perfectionism is a trait of character present in many women that have been dieting for a long time. Our diet brain tells us that we need to be perfect at food & exercise if we hope to ever change our body... and diets reinforce this need for perfection via their food rules and need to be “on plan” all the time. Worse, when we fail to achieve our diet goals, guess whose fault is it? Ours. The reason diet culture gives is that we are flawed... and if we were good enough aka had more discipline, it would have worked for us. So, we keep striving to be better and attempt to offset our flaw with a burning desire to be perfect. Perfectionism and Habit Creation The problem with perfectionist fantasy is that we set ourselves up for failure, which results in a lack of integrity with ourselves. And we feel bad about that, too! Not only are we flawed for not being able to diet successfully, but now we can’t even trust ourselves. So, we fantasize even more about our perfect meal plan and exercise regimen and hope that tomorrow will be the right day. The problem is that in order to be able to create consistent long-term habits, we need to trust and believe in ourselves. We need to be able to start small to be able to grow big but diet brain hates that! Minimum Baseline Minimum baseline is the anti-dote to perfection. It is how you can recover from perfectionism and diet brain all in one. Minimum baseline is how you will repair your integrity with yourself and begin a trustworthy relationship with YOU. Minimum baseline is simple... too simple for our perfectionistic brain. It will be hard to manage your mind and all the self-critical thoughts that will come along. In this episode, I teach you how to use the model of minimum baseline to successfully create new habits in your life when you have a diet brain! This model will shift your paradigm about needing to be perfect! What you’ll learn today:  The relationship between us being a perfectionist and dieting What needs to come first before creating new habits The perfectionist paradigm shift to implement in your life The key to consistent lifetime habits What is minimum baseline and how to implement in your life  Mentioned on the show: Get Started with our FREE Intuitive Eating Introduction Course Free Workshop Academy Registration \xa0  |  On today\'s episode, we\'ll talk about stepping beyond the struggle In a way, this podcast is not just a message to those of you who are struggling, but it’s also a message to my former self. It’s the advice I wish someone shared with me when I was struggling. It’s the advice I wish I had when I went through so many dark times. My struggle was my weight. Like most of you... for 25 years, that struggle occupied my life. It caused me lots of emotional pain, physical pain with crazy exercise protocols, tears,\xa0 break up, missed relationship, the struggle of my body and weight caused a lot of drama in my life. And for 25 years, I believed that the only way to stop the struggle to get over that pain was to lose weight. Some say... but you did lose weight. Yes, I did multiple times but here’s where it gets really crazy... when I did lose weight, you’d think struggle would be over right? No, it didn’t. Instead, I just moved on to the next expression of the problem: saggy skin, soft skin on my belly, I\'m still not thin enough for a partner to desire my body... I was addicted to the weight problem... I was addicted to the drama it created in my life. So, what did I do to step beyond the struggle? That what we will explore in today’s podcast. What you’ll learn listening to this episode:  What is Diet Brain and how it plays within your struggle How we get addicted to the problem at the center of our struggle The importance of your mind in stepping beyond the struggle How to step beyond the struggle  Mindset Model First model: become aware of your thought Second model: reframe-change your thought T: What is the trigger? What event typically or currently trigger the negative body self-talk? T: What am I saying to myself in this situation? What are my thoughts? Before reframing... F: How does this thinking make me feel? A: How am I reacting (or wanting to react) behaviorally to this experience? What will be my new way of thinking about this trigger? New thinking, new choices, new decision. \xa0 Mentioned on the show: Academy Scholarship application Academy registration for Fall 2019 Get Started with our FREE Intuitive Eating Introduction Course  |  On today\'s episode, we\'ll talk about what\'s missing from your program As I shared on the last episode #200, we are in the midst of an epidemic and no, it’s not an obesity epidemic. It’s the Diet Culture epidemic. It has become completely normal to not like our body. It’s expected that we shame ourselves and our body if it doesn’t fit the “thin ideal”. It has also become the norm to be on some kind of health programs that restrict the way we live our life. These same programs require that we disconnect from our body in order to be successful. This has led us to no longer respect and trust our bodies. This is huge! We live in an approximately 3 cubic foot space (our physical body) that we disrespect & doubt nearly every day. Without a healthy, respectful and trustworthy relationship, how can we expect our body to support us towards our goals? There is one universal law that is common to all religions and spiritual beliefs that I’m aware of (and please correct me if I’m wrong😀): Love is always the answer. In this episode, we dive deeper in what’s missing from your program and provide you with solution to fill the gap! What you’ll learn listening to this episode:  Why it has become completely normal to ignore these 2 ”things” from nearly all health programs What are the signs that something is missing from your program 5 steps you can take to begin implementing to fill the gap in your life and health program A quick exercise to help you shift your mindset around what’s missing on your program  Mentioned on the show: Get Started with our FREE Intuitive Eating Introduction Course Power of Intention Part 1 Power of Intention Part 2  | \xa0 On today\'s episode, we dissect this concept of food labeling We are in the middle of an epidemic. One that is destroying the quality and longevity of our life. It affects not only us but our children and their children. While it’s been around for a while, it’s growing at an alarming rate. Not only here… but all around the world. You’d be hard-pressed to find a culture that isn’t struggling with it. and no, it’s not Obesity. It’s our obsession with weight and diet. 97% of women surveyed by Glamour magazine in 2011 said they felt hatred towards their body at least 1x day and often much more. 8/10 women are unhappy with their reflection. So we diet... and diet some more. Never really getting “there” and then at some point after decades of trying you think to yourself… “That’s crazy I can’t do this for the rest of my life?” but then what? There is a solution to help you stop dieting, a solution that will provide some structure around how you engage with food that will lead you to eat better consistently without restricting or being on a diet. That solution is Intuitive Eating. In this episode, we are going to the basics and sharing with you a FREE tool to get started with ending your relationship with dieting and starting a new one with your body.

We label food in hopes that doing so will bring us closer to our desires and goals. The concept is that if we consume the “good” food will control our health and body unfortunately what comes along is shame & guilt when we do eat the “bad” food. In today’s society not being able to control our food choices makes us weak people. That’s what we think as a result of being told so by diet culture and also according to all the health experts who want us to finally “release the unhealthy weight”. But it’s true that there is such a thing as good food or bad food? If so, what are the healthy foods? Here’s a sample of the myths we will cover:  What are the good and bad foods Why are we so obsessed with food labeling What motivates our need for food labeling The side effect of food labeling If there is an option to food labeling, what is it and how can we implement it in our life  Mentioned on the show: Get Started with our FREE Intuitive Eating Introduction Course Intuitive Eating Project ', 'chan_desc': "Health beyond dieting is possible.

Not because its impossible to get pregnant right off the pill, but you don’t know what’s going to happen with your hormones and cycle.Lisa Hendrickson-Jack is a certified Fertility Awareness Educator and Holistic Reproductive Health Practitioner who teaches women to chart their menstrual cycles for natural birth control, conception, and monitoring overall health. In her new book The Fifth Vital Sign, Lisa debunks the myth that regular ovulation is only important when you want children by recognising the menstrual cycle as a vital sign. Drawing heavily from the current scientific literature, Lisa presents an evidence-based approach to fertility awareness and menstrual cycle optimisation. She hosts the Fertility Friday Podcast, a weekly radio show devoted to helping women connect to their fifth vital sign by uncovering the connection between menstrual cycle health, fertility, and overall health.Facebook: Facebook.com/FertilityFridaysInstagram: @FertilityFriday Twitter: @FertileFriday Pinterest: FertilityFridaySkype: FertilityFridayFreebies:https://www.fertility-friday.com/freebies5th Vital Sign Bookhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Fifth-Vital-Sign-Optimize-Fertility/dp/1999428005/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=5th+vital+sign&qid=1563986299&s=books&sr=1-1Taking charge of your fertility bookhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Taking-Charge-Your-Fertility-Reproductive/dp/0091887585----more----In this episode we discuss:> How our hormones fluctuate during our menstrual cycle> Why going on the pill for hormonal symptoms is like putting your headphones in when the smoke alarm is going off> What a healthy cycle and period actually looks like> Fertility awareness method (FAM) and how to chart BBT, cervical mucus and cervix position correctly----more----ENROL NOW! : Hormones in Harmony 6 week group coaching programme:https://www.vivanaturalhealth.co.uk/group-coaching-programmeGot a podcast question?

\xa0 Dr. Stephan Guyenet, who has spent more than a decade studying the neuroscience of body fatness, argues that most of us aren’t choosing our eating habits at all. \xa0 His book, The Hungry Brain, dives into the idea that eating behaviors aren’t a result of weakness or poor willpower, but of an evolutionary mismatch between our brain’s ancient programming and our current environment.\xa0 \xa0 Today he sits down with Dotsie and Alexandra to explain how our brains are hardwired to seek the high-calorie, dopamine-releasing foods that our ancestors relied on, and why that works against us in modern society.\xa0 \xa0 You’ll hear what your neurochemistry is influencing your eating habits, why you’re suddenly hungry for dessert after being satiated by dinner, and what you can do to overcome some of these neurological triggers that make it difficult to change the way you eat.\xa0 \xa0 If you’ve ever been frustrated by a craving or your habit of second helpings, don’t miss this episode to hear why, if you want to change your stomach, you need to focus on your head.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 What we discuss in this episode: \xa0 - Dotsie’s experience at the Plant-Based World Conference & Expo \xa0 - How convenience, cost, and the palatable seduction of food have contributed to higher rates of obesity \xa0 - Why do we have a greater eating drive than we did only a century ago?

We talk about why women deserve fat-positive, weight-inclusive fertility (and overall healthcare, of course). We take a hard look at the evidence, some of which we\'re still missing because the research world is still heavily weight-centric. And we review ways in which ALL of us can do better to support practitioners that are weight-inclusive.\xa0 Follow Nicola\'s work: @FatPositiveFertility\xa0|\xa0FatPositiveFertility.com The things we referenced:  Nicola\'s free resource:  The Fat Girl\'s Guide to Getting Pregnant "Exaggerating the Risks Again" via The Well-Rounded Mama "When You\'re Told You\'re Too Fat to Get Pregnant" by Virginia Sole-Smith for New York Times* A diagram "comparing \'maximal efficiency\' outcomes in IVF" by Jess @HAES_StudentDoctor  Advocating for weight-inclusive healthcare/assessing whether you\'ll receive fat-positive healthcare, by Nicola Salmon  Additional resources:\xa0  A Review of Pregnancy in Women Over 35 Stigma in Practice: Barriers to Health for Fat Women Weight-loss surgery and risk of pregnancy and birth complications  *Snippets from the article (though the full text is an important read):\xa0 “In 1952, a pair of Boston physicians published  a study in The New England Journal of Medicine titled “The Relation of Obesity to Menstrual Disturbances.” The authors surveyed 100 women between the ages of 16 and 40 who had been given diagnoses of menstrual disorders and compared their weights with a control group with no reproductive health issues. 43% of the patients with menstrual disorders weighed 20% or more than their “ideal weight,” compared with just 13% of the control subjects. Their findings, the authors concluded, gave ‘factual proof to the clinical impression of the association of obesity and menstrual disturbances.’” A study done like this today would likely not go so far as to claim ‘factual proof’, but rather correlation with weight and menstrual disorders. However, it’s crucial to look at all of the factors, instead of zoning in on one (weight).\xa0\xa0 “...data collected on 7,327 pregnancies from 1959 to 1965 --it took heavier women a median of one to two months longer to conceive, compared with women with B.M.I.s in the “normal weight” range. A 2015 study of 1,602 Italian women undergoing I.V.F. found that the bigger women were just as likely to get pregnant, but were more likely to miscarry. All in all,  the research shows a correlating decline in successful pregnancy rates as B.M.I. rises.” (The latter is also true of age.)  “In comparison, a 2008 evidence review of the relationship between maternal age and stillbirth risk found that thinner women over 35 were also almost twice as likely to have a stillborn delivery compared with their younger counterparts.” OTHER STUFF:\xa0 Reach out with questions for the show, comments, or feedback anytime: RDRealTalk at Gmail.com\xa0 Follow Heather Caplan\'s work: HeatherCaplan.com , @RDRealTalk | [Replay!] Jessica Jones, dietitian and co-host of Food Heaven podcast, joins me to chat about her career, and then, Whole30.

He’s witnessed the impact that food can have on our health. He says we now have to “Consider more than just the health benefits of what we eat; we also have to consider the ecological footprint of our food choices.” In 2014 Dr Goldin joined his brothers Darren and Ryan, who have 12 years experience farming insects with their business Reptile Feeders, to start Entomo Farms, North America’s first and largest insect farm, dedicated to raising insects, specifically for human consumption. In January 2015, Entomo Farms worked out of facilities that were 5000 square feet. They now have 20,000 square feet of work and development space as they continue to lead the field of “Bugtrepreneurs”. Entomo Farms has been covered in the media such as Toronto Life, LaPress+, The Globe and Mail, Washington Post, and more. \xa0 Topics discussed: \xa0   Jarrods interest in edible interests   The\xa0origin story of Entomo Farms   Cricket Protein for pets   The history of eating insects   Getting over the “yuck factor"   Choosing sustainable protein   Prebiotic Fibre in Cricket Flour   Micronutrients in Cricket Flour   What is Chitin?

We also discuss using deuterium depleted water as a cancer prevention strategy and other benefits like improved gut health and athletic performance. \xa0 \xa0  Bio: \xa0   Dr Gábor\xa0Somlyai graduated as a biologist from the\xa0University of Szeged in 1982. Between 1982 and 1990 he worked for the Department of Plant Pathology, Plant Protection Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He had a scholarship from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences while studying for his PhD and defended his thesis in molecular biology in 1988. Dr Somlyai spent six months at the Georg-August University in Göttingen on a DFG scholarship after receiving his PhD. He followed that with a postdoctoral fellowship in the field of genetic engineering and gene mapping at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.   In the wake of the Hungarian, Nobel-prize winning scientist Albert Szent-Györgyi – who said that the true cause of cancer should be looked for at the sub-molecular level – Gábor began his examining the biological importance of naturally occurring deuterium as a senior research fellow at the Hungarian Institute of Oncology in 1990. In 1993 Gabor\xa0established HYD Ltd. for Research and Development (now HYD LLC. for Cancer Research and Drug Development) to carry out cancer research and drug development based on the proprietary procedure called deuterium depletion. Dr Somlyai served as the scientific director of HYD Ltd. between 1993 and 1997 before becoming the CEO of the company. In 2012 he also began serving as the General Director of HYD’s parent company, HYD Pharma Inc. His book, Defeating Cancer!, was published in Hungary in 2000. It has since been published in Romania, Japan, China, South-Korea and the U.S.A.

We talk about the ins and outs of fermenting vegetables, cider making, miso, tempeh, natto and much more. \xa0 Bio: \xa0  Kirsten & Christopher Shockey got their start in fermenting foods, first in their home, and then with their farmstead food company (Mellonia Farm), where they created over forty varieties of cultured vegetables and krauts. When they realised their passion was for the process, they chose to focus on teaching the art of fermenting vegetables. Kirsten & Christopher still experiments with new recipes, helping others set up in-house or farmstead “fermentories”, and teach classes at their farm and hosts small farm workshops. Kirsten & Christopher lives on a 40-acre hillside homestead in the Applegate Valley of Southern Oregon, where they have cultivated a handmade life for the last 15 years. Their days are a chaotic combination of parenting, day jobs, writing and navigating whatever the climate and the rural lifestyle throws their way.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  \xa0 Topics discussed: \xa0    Knowing where your foods comes from   Preserving the bounty   Farm steading   Growing food chemically free for optimal health   You are what you eat   Regenerative Farming   Zach Bush Podcast   https://podcast.nourishmeorganics.com.au/zach-bush-md-on-glyphosate-the-chronic-disease-epidemic-and-solutions-for-a-brighter-future   Exploring Diets that work for you   Supporting Farmers   The Power of Consumers   Eating low on the food chain   More whole foods and less processed foods   City Gardens and Communal Gardens   Easy vegetables to grow and ferment   Fermented Vegetables book   https://www.nourishmeorganics.com.au/products/fermented-vegetables-by-kirsten-christopher-shockey   Craving fermented foods   Commercial production of fermented vegetables   Kirsten’s first fermented vegetable recipe   Fermented foods fusions   How to work out the appropriate salt ratio   The purpose of salt in the fermentation   Fermenting tomatoes   Fermenting cucumbers (pickles)   Controlling bad funk/ spoilage - yeast, mould and fungi   Enhancing good funk- fermented flavours   Brine and Fermento   "Submerge in brine conquers evil every time"   Adjusting recipes for different climates and conditions- salt vs heat   Real ferments vs pasteurised ferments   Encouraging children to consume ferments   Tasting regularly   Fermenting in mason jars   Fermentation Variables   Top five vegetables ferments for beginners   Fermented French Fries   Unconventional vegetables to ferment   Fermenting herbs   Rule of thumb for fermenting time   Temperature vs Crock Size vs Ferment time vs Flavour/ Texture   Optimal ferment time for maximum probiotic content and predigestion\xa0   Seaweed ferments   Hard cider making   Using wild yeasts   Fermentation time for Cider Making   New book: Miso, Tempeh, Natto   Incorporating ferments into your meal   Making Koji   Controlling temperature\xa0   Miso Making   What is a garum?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garum   Top tips for Gut Health   \xa0 \xa0  Brought to you by: \xa0 Nourishme Organics- Your Fermented Food Making Store \xa0   Shop Fermented Vegetables- 10% off using code: \xa0shockey \xa0 https://www.nourishmeorganics.com.au/collections/fermented-vegetables \xa0   \xa0 Allele Microbiome- Microbiome Testing \xa0  Microbiome Stool testing (10% off Gut Explorer Pro using code: gutlove)\xa0 \xa0  https://www.allele.com.au/collections/frontpage/products/gut-microbiome-analysis \xa0  \xa0   Connect with Kirsten and Christopher Shockey \xa0 Website-\xa0www.ferment.works \xa0 \xa0   Connect with Kriben Govender:\xa0 \xa0 Facebook-\xa0https://www.facebook.com/kribengee/ Instagram-\xa0https://www.instagram.com/kribengovender/ Youtube-\xa0https://www.youtube.com/c/Nourishmeorganics?sub_confirmation=1 Gut Health Gurus Facebook Group:\xa0https://www.facebook.com/groups/nourishmeorganics/ Mito Wellness Support Facebook Group:\xa0https://www.facebook.com/groups/347845406055631/ \xa0  Download links \xa0  \xa0   \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 If you enjoyed this episode and would like to show your support: \xa0 1) Please subscribe on Itunes and leave a positive review \xa0 \xa0 Instructions: \xa0 - Click this link\xa0 https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/gut-health-gurus-podcast/id1433882512?mt=2 \xa0 - Click "View in Itunes" button on the left hand side - This will open Itunes app - Click "Subscribe" button - Click on "Ratings and Reviews" tab - Click on "Write a Review" button \xa0  Non Itunes user’s can leave a Google Review here: http://bit.ly/nourishmeorganics  \xa0 \xa0 2) Subscribe, like and leave a positive comment on Youtube \xa0 https://www.youtube.com/c/Nourishmeorganics?sub_confirmation=1 \xa0 3) Share your favourite episode on Facebook, Instagram, and Stories 4) Let your friends and family know about this Podcast by email, text, messenger etc    5) Support us on Patreon for as little as $5 per month and get same day, early access to our latest podcasts (typically around 4 to 6 weeks earlier than the general public)   https://www.patreon.com/nourishmeorganics   \xa0 Thank you so much for your support.

They don’t just detox you but rather work through reasons you became addicted in the first place.Yet, for some reason, we view food differently.How effective do you think it would be to get a drug addict clean for 10 days but do only just that? No address the hurts, “the why” it started in the first place.Why would food be any different?If you insist on calling yourself a sugar addict + you know how that all addicts aren’t just born addicts, how do you think you have grown to become dependent on sugar to manage your emotions?This is why you must address sugar addiction physically, mentally, soulfully, habitually, + Sugar Rehab is the motherfucking best program to do that.Stop putting a bandaide on the real reason you aren’t losing weight.You must change the way you look at life + your place in it.You must change the lense you look through.You must change the way you engage with people + what you allow.You must change the way you handle your emotions, or rather you must truly handle your emotions not stuff them down.+ that is the work we are doing in Sugar Rehab:\xa0https://www.melissaronda.com/rehab | Click here to learn more about Bad Bitch Society:\xa0https://www.melissaronda.com/society\xa0Timehop videos have been coming up in my feed recently + that’s not an accident. They are cringy which is good because that means I am growing so quickly. I am energetically, tactically, physically becoming the woman I’ve always wanted to be. This is always how it is supposed to be.\xa0The alternative is to be like Uncle Ricco from Napoleon Dynamite, living in the past, always dreaming + talking about his hay day as the high school quarterback while living out of a van selling Tupperware to housewives.\xa0When you decide it gets to be, life keeps getting better + better. Everything starts adding up in your favor.Everything is on purpose.\xa0I lost a f*ckton of weight + kept it off by raising the expectations for myself + my life.THAT is what I am going to be sharing with you today.\xa0\xa0\xa0K.

[clicks on post]Always always always, my bad news posts get 500% more traction than my positive ones.That is not an exaggeration. 500% Most of y\'all gingerly clicked on this post hoping to see that I\'ve failed miserably - which I have, but we will go into more detail about that in a bit.But anyways, it\'s f*cking irresistible, isn\'t it?It\'s like a car accident."Oh the horror! I can\'t turn away!"You aren\'t a ghoulish monster for being curious about someone else\'s public shame or pain.\xa0 Everyone does it."The bottom line is this, people love seeing other people fail because most people fear failure above all else."\xa0But I\'m not most people + neither are you...I f*ck up all the time.\xa0In fact, I f*ck up this morning [installing an exterior storm door handle upside down]I love f*cking up.\xa0F*cking up teaches me more than succeeding easily ever has.PatienceProblem-solvingDetermination in the face of adversityPumping the brakes on hubrisMad unconditional love for myselfI have no emotional attachment to failure.It doesn\'t bother me in the slightest.For me, no matter what happens I am okay with feeling any feelings that come up.Does that sound cocky? It\'s not.Cocky is thinking you will succeed no matter what.I\'m saying it would be nice to succeed the first time I try something, but I\'m confident that I\'ll be okay either way."I will go after anything I want + most times I don\'t succeed the first time."Did you hear me or do you need to read that again?I will go after anything I want + most times I don\'t succeed the first time.\xa0In fact, the things I am most proud of are things I f*cked up the most until I got them right.Awwwwww, breath that sh*t out sister.
