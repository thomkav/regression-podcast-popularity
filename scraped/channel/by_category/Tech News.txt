This week on Decrypted, reporter Shelly Banjo explores how age-old dangers like drugs, child predators and school shooters have shifted onto new platforms, and how one school has tried to adapt. | A few years ago, reporter Sarah McBride noticed that a top engineer at Twitter was also an expert on the brains of birds. Then, more and more, she started seeing that many top tech companies have bird brain experts in their highest ranks\u2060—that includes Apple, Google, Intel and a secretive startup founded by Elon Musk. This week on Decrypted, Sarah and fellow reporter Ashlee Vance set out to understand why Silicon Valley is so interested in avian minds, and what they could tell us about tech’s ability to influence our own. | Google has long had a special relationship with staff, encouraging employee input on all sorts of internal matters. For the last two decades, this approach has worked well. But after a series of controversies and protests in the last two years, some workers are openly at war with Google. This week on Decrypted, editor Alistair Barr speaks to Irene Knapp, a senior software engineer who has had a front-row seat during the tumult inside the company. | Northern White Rhinos are functionally extinct: The two remaining females have no males to breed with.

When Mandarin-language calls began to bombard residents across the U.S., authorities take a deeper look. They find that these illegal robocalls are targeting areas with large Chinese American populations. Victims of the Chinese consulate scam are told they are in legal trouble with the Chinese government. The scammers then persuade them to hand over money or personal information to resolve the phony problem. Victims lose $150,000 on average. And, in Chinatowns across America, scammers are targeting older Chinese Americans in the blessing scam, aka the ghost scam. This scam uses some victims’ traditional beliefs to lure them into an elaborate con that involves a team of scammers who work in tandem to steal valuables and cash. | Looking for a change of pace, FBI agent Gasper decides to move from New York, where he’s lived his entire life, to North Dakota. As he settles in to his new field office in the Midwest, Gasper discovers that there are an alarming number of lottery scams being perpetrated against residents in his area. The cases are complex, and with many of the scammers overseas, they are hard to bring to trial. But Gasper is set on getting justice for the victims of these swindles and dedicates himself to investigating the crimes. Meanwhile, Nancy, a 78-year-old retired financial planner, receives a letter stating that she’s won the lottery. To claim her prize, she just needs to pay the taxes on her winnings. She isn’t sure if the claim is legitimate and is hesitant to proceed. But after receiving multiple assurances from the scammers over months, Nancy gives in and sends them $20,000 and becomes one of the many victims Gasper will interview as part of his investigation. After years of painstaking work, the FBI agent finally gets the break he’s been looking for. He links a U.S. resident to the lottery-scam ring that operates overseas. This is the connecting piece that Gasper needs and will lead to a large-scale U.S. trial, the arrest of 27 scammers, and justice for 95 victims. | Pat, an 81-year-old woman from Kentucky, receives a call that she has won a $7.5 million lottery prize. Pat can’t believe her luck. Unaware that the call is a scam, she begins speaking with the scammers multiple times a day. Over the next seven months, they befriend Pat in an effort to convince her that she’ll receive the prize money as soon as she pays taxes on her winnings. Slowly they gain Pat’s trust, and she starts sending money to the scammers. Every time she thinks she has made a final payment and will receive her prize, the scammers come up with a new issue requiring her to send more money. Eventually the scammers take over $100,000 from Pat. Unfortunately, Pat’s story is common among lottery-scam victims. Often by the time these scams are uncovered, victims have lost thousands of dollars, and because of the difficulties in tracking down and prosecuting scammers, most never receive restitution. However, determined to get a better outcome for citizens, the state of Kentucky has dedicated resources to fight back against scammers. Investigators in the Kentucky Attorney General’s office have been working to track down and prosecute scammers, and their efforts are paying off. In the last four years the Kentucky Attorney General’s office has returned $2.1 million to victims of fraud. When they hear about Pat’s case they dive in, following the money, hoping to apprehend the scammers and get justice for Pat. | After losing her job and boyfriend in the same day, a distraught Debra pays a visit to a psychic shop. Little does Debra know that the shop is part of a larger criminal organization and Sylvia, the psychic who gives her a reading, is a scammer. After a series of readings of increasing cost, Sylvia tells Debra that all of her troubles stem from her trust issues surrounding money. To solve these problems Sylvia prompts Debra to hand over a $28,000 check — to prove that she trusts others with her money. Sylvia promises to hold on to the check and return it the next day. However, Sylvia immediately cashes the check and cuts off all communication with Debra. \xa0 Debra tries a number of ways to get her money back — including contacting the police — to no avail. Eventually Debra is referred to Bob Nygard, a private investigator and retired police officer who specializes in helping victims of psychic scams. Debra tells Bob about her case, and he agrees to take it on. Bob works to chase down the facts, trying to get Debra justice. He finds that Sylvia has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from victims. It takes five years, but Bob finally gathers enough evidence to take down Sylvia. \xa0 | Debra is a divorced mother and ballroom dancer who travels between her home in Florida and New York to train with her dance partner. When Debra loses her part-time job in New York and boyfriend in the same day, she’s distraught. Without the extra income from her job and a place to stay from her boyfriend, Debra knows she’ll have to quit ballroom dancing — even though she and her partner have been climbing the ranks on the Pro-Am circuit. Walking in Greenwich Village, Debra sees a psychic shop she often passes. Today it catches her eye. She is searching for answers and decides to stop in. The shop is well- appointed with lavish decor and plaques that show additional locations in glamorous cities around the world. Sylvia, the psychic who comes to give Debra a reading, is dressed to the nines — like many professionals you would see in New York. After the initial reading, Sylvia says she can help Debra but that she’ll need to come back for a deep reading. When Debra returns for the two-hour deep reading, Sylvia determines that Debra has trust issues, particularly when it involves money. Seeking closure and desperate for a solution to her problems, Debra starts to believe and trust Sylvia. The psychic tells Debra to write her a check for $28,000 and promises she will hold on to it for one day.\xa0When she\xa0returns the check, Sylvia tells Debra that her money and trust issues will be solved.\xa0Debra follows Sylvia’s instructions and gets the money for the check from a home equity loan. However, as soon as she hands the check over, Debra realizes she has made a\xa0terrible mistake. | Rob, a veteran in his 70’s, was a caretaker for his wife for years. He is still grieving her death when he receives a call from a woman claiming to be from social security. The woman tells Rob that his social security number has been used to defraud multiple banks and there is a warrant out for his arrest. Even more troubling for Rob, the woman tells him that he will need to get all new identification cards. Rob has been looking forward to taking his special needs daughter on a much needed vacation and worries he won’t be able to get a new license in time for the trip. In a frenzied state, he begins to comply with the instructions of the woman on the phone. But as her directions get stranger, Rob begins to question if he’s doing the right thing. He realizes that he may be the victim of a scam. Unfortunately, by this time the scammers have already emptied out Rob’s savings account. Rob is distraught as this means he’ll have to cancel his trip with his daughter. But, just when he’s about to lose all hope, Rob’s community steps in to help. | After 26 years of service, U.S. Army Col. Bryan Denny retires from an incredible career in the military and begins to receive odd messages. They’re coming from women around the world who claim to be in online relationships with him. But Bryan isn’t on any dating sites. Meanwhile Kathy Walters is learning about the online boyfriend of her friend Sharon. They plan to marry, but Sharon has never met the man in person because he claims to be in the military stationed overseas. Sharon shows Kathy a picture of the man she knows as Ross, but the name on his uniform reads Bryan Denny. Unsure if her friend is in a real romance or caught up in romance scam, Kathy begins to investigate. She heads to Facebook, and what she finds is shocking. The same picture Kathy’s friend has fallen in love with is featured in multiple profiles across the internet under a wide variety of names. That’s when Kathy knows she needs to track down the real Bryan Denny. After some digging, Kathy is able to locate him and reaches out to see if Bryan has any knowledge of what’s going on. Bryan has been fielding calls, emails and sometimes in-person visits from women who’ve fallen in love with his picture. Together, Bryan and Kathy uncover hundreds of fraudulent social media and dating site accounts that are using Bryan’s image, as well as images of his family members, to entice women into romance scams. Disgusted by what they’ve found, Kathy and Bryan decide to fight back against these scammers. | TripAdvisor and the\xa0Federal Communications Commission\xa0are conducting separate investigations into the same series of robocalls that have caused a public nuisance. The FCC became aware of the calls when\xa0they\xa0shut down a paging service used to communicate with emergency personnel. TripAdvisor began to investigate when\xa0its\xa0customers reported\xa0that these\xa0calls were fraudulently using\xa0the travel site’s\xa0name to sell vacation packages. Finally, after months of investigating, the head of TripAdvisor’s\xa0anti-fraud (“anti-fraud,” not “fraud” team)\xa0team, Fred Garvin, gets a break in the case. He personally receives\xa0one\xa0of the robocalls that have been plaguing TripAdvisor’s customers. Working\xa0backward\xa0to find the source of the\xa0call, TripAdvisor gathers the information\xa0it needs\xa0to track down where the calls are coming from. Once\xa0it has\xa0sufficient evidence, TripAdvisor reaches out to the FCC.\xa0To the website’s\xa0surprise, the FCC has also been tirelessly investigating the same robocalls. Now working together, TripAdvisor and the FCC build a case against the source of the calls,\xa0“Robocall King”\xa0Adrian Abramovich.\xa0The FCC finds that in a\xa0three-month\xa0period,\xa0\xa0Abramovich is responsible for making more than 96 million robocalls. These illegal\xa0calls\xa0use the names of companies\xa0such as\xa0TripAdvisor,\xa0Marriott, Expedia, and Hilton to trick victims into purchasing vacation packages. With the\xa0culprit identified, the FCC gets to\xa0work shutting down Abramovich’s operation. | The average American is on the receiving end of more than 150\xa0robocalls a year. Some robocalls, which are automated telephone calls placed by a computerized auto dialer, have legitimate purposes. Unfortunately, many of these calls are used to pester or scam consumers. In June 2019 alone\xa0Americans received 4.35 billion robocalls, with scams and telemarketing making up over\xa050 percent. Curious about the barrage of robocalls he\xa0himself\xa0receives, journalist Alex Palmer decides to look into how robocalls work and why they’ve become so popular. He finds that advances in technology and the low cost of placing robocalls—as little as\xa04 cents\xa0per dial—have made\xa0this nuisance\xa0a popular marketing tool for scammers. After digging deeper into the trend, Alex discovers the case of a set of illegal robocalls that temporarily stalled a Virginia-based paging provider, disrupting the ability of hospitals to get in touch with emergency services personnel. As a result, local doctors, nurses, EMTs and\xa0firefighters\xa0were at risk of missing critical pages. Due to the\xa0resulting\xa0public safety hazard, the\xa0Federal Communications Commission made tracking down the source of these robocalls a top priority. Meanwhile,\xa0travel-review website TripAdvisor\xa0is being inundated with complaints from customers that\xa0it is\xa0soliciting them through\xa0robocalls to use\xa0its\xa0travel rewards program. But TripAdvisor isn’t making the calls and doesn’t have a rewards program. With\xa0its\xa0reputation at stake, TripAdvisor puts\xa0its\xa0top fraud experts on the case.\xa0The FCC and the travel site\xa0will eventually learn that they are on the hunt for the same man, Adrian Abramovich. | In a Texas suburb, a typical lottery scam has turned into something much more sinister. A scammer has promised a retired couple a fictitious lottery payout if they continue to send him money for fees and taxes. With their life savings gone, the victims are forced to sell their home. But the swindler isn’t done with them yet, as his constant calls have created a bond between him and the 70-year-old woman, who may be suffering from dementia. He realizes that she has grown fond of him and pivots from a lottery to a romance scam. He promises her a beautiful life together on the sandy beaches of Jamaica, where he’s based. The con man tells her that all he needs is money in order to start building an oceanfront dream home that they can share. To come up with the funds, he proposes a disturbing plan. He demands that she kill her husband and flee to Jamaica with the proceeds of their home sale. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, which has been monitoring a trail of cash making its way from the U.S. to the scammer in Jamaica, discovers the couple in Texas and sends an agent to their home. When the agent arrives, little does he know he’s about to walk into a murder plot.', 'chan_desc': 'Learn how to protect yourself from scammers.

This is a common anti-pattern that many teams face.\xa0 In this episode, we talk through Nick’s efforts to help the Product Owner understand the consequences of his behavior. It’s never an easy situation to be in, but we must be ready.\xa0 About Nick Stewart Nick has worked in the "Projects Space" for the last 5 years, initially working with business change, then in IT using Prince 2, Waterfall and ultimately found Agile organically through pain of delivering projects using the other methodologies. More recently he has taken on a Delivery Lead role which allows him to continue to learn whilst helping teams deliver continuous value.

We talk about a PO that felt their role was to be the voice of the customer, and the PO who felt the team was merely a “service provider” and they were the “outsider” who would demand service. \xa0  Are you having trouble helping the team working well with their Product Owner? We’ve put together a course to help you work on the collaboration team-product owner.

When assessing our own success as Scrum Masters, we must look not only at how the team performs but also how we get there. How we contribute to that team’s success.\xa0 In this episode, we talk about some of the questions you can ask to learn if you are transitioning from that initial Scrum Mom role to an approach that allows the team to grow and continue on their own when you are not available. Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: Liquid organizations, and how to adapt When we reflect on our success or actions, we often focus on the task, and its success (or not). However, the way people contribute to the team may often be ignored. For example, a team member that is focused on helping others succeed may feel they are “not contributing”. In this episode, we discuss a different approach to retrospectives. An approach inspired by the concept of Liquid Organizations by Stelio Verzera, and that focuses on recognizing the contribution of each team member to the common success. Team members evaluate their peers’ contribution, so that the person who was focused on helping, may feel they contribute, even if they don’t work on many stories. \xa0 About Sebastian Reverso Sebastian is from Tucuman, Argentina.

In this episode, we talk about how introducing ideas in different ways may have radically different results. We identify some approaches that have worked well, and we talk about the concept of “baby steps”, or relentless movement towards a direction. Finally, we discuss how to involve the team members directly in that process. As Scrum Masters we don’t need to tell the team what to do, they know. If they understand why the change is necessary, they can come up with the right steps. \xa0 About Sebastian Reverso Sebastian is from Tucuman, Argentina.

In this episode, we focus on the “professional jealousy” that some team members showed towards each other. We discuss how to detect it, and what the possible consequences of that behavior might be. Learn to detect it, and listen in to learn how Sebastian helped the team move forward. In this episode, we refer to the  Agile retrospective format: The Treasure Island, and to  Solution Focused Coaching.\xa0 Featured Book for the Week: Por Un Scrum Popular: Notas para una Revolución Ágile (Spanish Edition)  Por Un Scrum Popular by Mayer and Cyment is the Spanish edition of the popular:  The People\'s Scrum by Tobias Mayer.\xa0 Sebastian found especially informative the aspects of the day-to-day Scrum that the authors go through, and how they compare what work looks like when using Scrum and when not using Scrum.\xa0 In this segment, we also refer to  the Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast episode with Claudia Toscano where the book “Por un Scrum Popular” is discussed in more depth. \xa0 About Sebastian Reverso Sebastian is from Tucuman, Argentina.

A few months into that new role, he was facing a situation where the application was blowing up everywhere. As the team pushed to release quickly, they didn’t account for all the technical problems or even some of the non-functional requirements they had to adhere to. As a developer-turned-Scrum Master, Sebastian had to learn the hard way how to help teams “divide and conquer” their work. We discuss how we can avoid similar problems in other teams, and some of the techniques Sebastian learned to help teams in that same situation. In this episode, we refer to the  Jassy’s episode where he also describes a transition from developer to Scrum Master. \xa0 About Sebastian Reverso Sebastian is from Tucuman, Argentina.

However, sometimes that PO confidence can morph into an autocratic, micro-managing approach. We discuss how to identify when that happens and what to out for when working with confident Product Owners. The Great Product Owner: Confident enough to be vulnerable When a Product Owner understands well the product they are managing, it becomes easier for them to interact with the team. But that’s just the start. A great Product Owner is also able to say what they don’t know, and invite the team to bring their own knowledge and contribution to the process of defining what to work on.\xa0 The Bad Product Owner: Second-guessing the team Product Owners benefit from having technical knowledge of the product they manage. However, when they use that technical knowledge to second-guess the team, it’s easy for conflict to emerge. In this episode, we talk about how to work with PO’s that start by trying to micro-manage the team and second-guess their decisions. It’s not easy, but there are certain techniques we can use to help those PO’s Are you having trouble helping the team working well with their Product Owner?

However, that’s only part of the success definition we discuss in this episode. We also talk about the need to focus on value and to have the team feel that they own the solution they are working on.\xa0 Featured Retrospective Format for the Week: The Starfish retrospective When we start experimenting with new retrospective formats,  the Starfish retrospective is a good place to start.

From her humble beginnings with a used 8-bit home computer, Rosa’s career experience includes over a decade in the CIA, leading cyber operations against terrorists and nation-state adversaries. She served multiple tours overseas as a cybersecurity analyst and technical intelligence officer in the Center for Cyber Intelligence and the Counterterrorism Mission Center, and was highly decorated for her service. She’s a strong advocate and mentor for women starting their careers, and is a member of Women in Defense and InfraGard. | Disinformation campaigns are in the news. Starting with the 2016 U.S. election cycle, continuing in 2018, and now looking ahead to 2020, the threat of online influence operations from foreign adversaries has been top of mind — but there’s a different kind of disinformation for sale on the dark web. Researchers from Recorded Future’s Insikt Group engaged with two threat actors selling their wares on Russian-speaking underground forums. They discovered that disinformation campaigns are readily available, not terribly expensive, and potentially highly effective. Roman Sannikov is director of analyst services at Recorded Future, and he shares what they found. | When we talk about threat intelligence, we often put it in the context of bringing information to the surface, creating context and alerts to let you know what you need to be concerned with. We also speak of cutting through the noise, of pulling the signal out and transforming it into actionable intelligence. Our guest today is Andrew Morris. He’s CEO of GreyNoise Intelligence, a company that describes itself as “anti-threat intelligence.” That’s not to say they’re against threat intelligence — quite the opposite, in fact — but instead of focusing on what should keep you up at night, Andrew and his team analyze the background noise of the internet to determine what you don’t need to worry about. It’s a unique approach that’s perhaps a bit counterintuitive at first, but ultimately, they say it helps you filter out useless noise and focus your time and resources on what really matters. | There has been a growing number of ransomware attacks targeting cities and towns across the U.S. Once hit, cities and towns face a number of tough decisions — pay the ransom, restore from backup — and all of this happens with a backdrop of needing to provide vital services to citizens. To add insult to injury, many cities and towns face tight IT and security budgets. They’ve been asking for more security and better backup tools, but are quite often being told that the money is simply not there. Recorded Future’s Allan Liska knows a thing or two about ransomware. He’s co-author of the book, “Ransomware: Defending Against Digital Extortion,” and he recently published the results of some ransomware research that he and his team at Recorded Future have been working on. He’ll share their findings, along with advice for keeping your organization safe. | Our guest today is Matt Devost. He’s CEO and co-founder of OODA LLC, a company that helps clients identify, manage, and respond to global risks and uncertainties. Matt Devost has been at the intersection of public policy and cybersecurity since it became possible to align the two. He has expertise in counterterrorism, critical infrastructure protection, intelligence, risk management, and cybersecurity issues.\xa0 In addition to sharing the story of his career journey, we’ll get his insights on managing cyber risk in a complex world, as well as his thoughts on threat intelligence. | Our guest today is Josh Kamdjou. He’s co-founder of Sublime Security, a company that’s looking to address the widespread security issues of phishing and spearphishing by offering open source tools that alert users to a range of potential indicators, as well as giving users the opportunity to share their findings with the community, to more quickly spread the word about new and growing threats.\xa0 We’ll learn about his career journey, get his thoughts on threat intelligence, and hear his advice for folks looking to enter the field. | Recent protests in Hong Kong have highlighted a growing trend in online influence operations, in this case from mainland China. Officials there have been using Western social media platforms to influence public perception of the Hong Kong protests. Those social media platforms have, in turn, shut down accounts they’ve determined are posting what they call “inauthentic content.”\xa0 Researchers in Recorded Future’s Insikt Group have been analyzing these attempts at online influence operations and have published a report titled “Chinese State Media Seeks to Influence International Perceptions of Hong Kong Protests.” Priscilla Moriuchi is head of nation-state research at Recorded Future, and she joins us to share their findings. | Our guest today is Cody Cornell.

It\'s a fascinating story all on its own, as the company finally goes public with a concept it has been experimenting with behind-the-scenes for much of the past decade. Surprise twist: It runs Android.But combined with the larger Surface Neo dual-screen tablet/notebook, the story is much bigger. Microsoft is trying to take the lead in a new category of computing, while expanding its focus beyond Windows to focus on apps and experiences across a range of devices.\xa0We share our reactions to the news on this episode, and ask the all-important question, is Microsoft cool again?Plus, a Seattle startup debuts a new pizza-making robot, and we nerd out on the new version of Flight Simulator, which is getting a boost from AI and the cloud, and modern satellite imagery.We\'re keeping it short this week as we get ready for our big annual technology conference. Hope to see you next week at the GeekWire Summit! | Amazon announced a series of new Echo and Alexa products and initiatives this week -- from smart glasses to wireless earbuds to a new neighborhood wireless initiative --\xa0 extending the reach of its devices and services well beyond the home, while attempting to address consumer concerns about privacy at the same time.\xa0Here\'s our coverage from the week.Why Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sees new opportunity in the yard, on the sidewalk, and beyondEverything Amazon announced at its devices event — Echo Buds, Echo Frames, Echo Studio, and moreBezos: Facial recognition ‘a perfect example’ of the need for regulation, and Amazon is working on itAmazon unveils new Alexa-powered Echo Buds, undercuts Apple’s AirPods with $129.99 price tag | A new skyscraper in Seattle will bear the name Qualtrics Tower, after the technology company that will occupy more than a dozen floors in the building, with plans to quadruple its employee count in the region to more than 2000 people in the next several years. So what is Qualtrics, anyway? It’s an experience management company, with co-headquarters in Seattle and Provo Utah, that was acquired by enterprise technology giant SAP for $8 billion. We\xa0sat down for a conversation recently with Julie Larson Green, a former Microsoft Windows and Office leader who is now the chief experience officer at Qualtrics, to talk about fundamental economic shift that the company is betting on. | The climate crisis surged to the top of the tech industry\'s agenda this week, encouraged by a groundswell of activity from workers at Amazon, Microsoft, Google and other big tech companies, as part of global efforts to bring attention to the issue. It\'s the latest example of rising activism inside the tech industry, as a new generation of workers pushes employers to speak out and take action on political, social and environmental issues.We discuss the protests and the larger trend on this episode of the GeekWire Podcast, with highlights from the climate walkout at Amazon\'s Seattle campus, and Jeff Bezos announcing the company\'s new Climate Pledge earlier in the week.In the second segment of the show, we discuss what the shutdown of LimePod says about the future of urban mobility in Seattle and around the world.And on the Random Channel this week, the scourge of "microplastics", Amazon\'s Allbirds knock-offs, and the "Showdown at the Window Seat." | From package delivery to ride-hailing, companies including Amazon and Uber are facing new scrutiny over their use of contract workers to power the services they provide to consumers.California is poised to enact a law that would force Uber and Lyft to treat drivers like employees as part of a broader push around the country to ensure app-based workers have broader labor protections. Meanwhile, three U.S. Senators are demanding answers from Amazon about its network of contractors and independent delivery companies that get packages to customers’ doors.We discuss the implications of these developments on this new episode of the GeekWire Podcast.Plus, a Seattle startup is aiming to upend the smartphone market with a high-quality, low-priced alternative designed to be used for twice as many years as many people use their existing phones. The inside story of Taylor Swift\'s beef with Microsoft\'s chatbot. And we do our best to help Alexa come up with some answers to difficult questions. | In “Tools & Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age,” Microsoft President Brad Smith and his co-author Carol Ann Browne tell the inside story of some of the biggest developments in tech and the world over the past decade -- including Microsoft’s reaction to the Snowden revelations, its battle with Russian hackers in the leadup to the 2016 elections and its role in the ongoing debate\xa0 privacy and facial recognition technology.\xa0The book goes behind-the-scenes at the Obama and Trump White Houses, explores the implications of the coming wave of artificial intelligence, and calls on tech giants and governments to step up and prepare for the ethical, legal and societal challenges of powerful new forms of technology yet to come.We touched on many of those topics in this conversation with Smith about the new book, due out Sept. 10. Smith will also speak at the upcoming GeekWire Summit. | Amazon ousted Apple this year as the most loved brand among millennials, people age 19 through 39, according to a new study. What does this say about the future of the world? OK, that might be taking it too far, but some of our resident millennials offer their take on this episode of the GeekWire Podcast. And in news for slightly older generations, the startup HopSkipRide made its debut in Seattle this week, promising to safely shuttle your kids around town. We explain how it works and try to decide if we and our kids will use it. Plus, in the Random Channel, Microsoft the Musical, insights from Burning Man, and the latest from the chicken beat.\xa0 | U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren appeared in Seattle on Sunday, a few blocks from Amazon\'s headquarters, and given the Democratic presidential candidate\'s call to break up the online retail giant as part of a larger crackdown on big tech companies, we were anticipating fireworks. It didn\'t happen. In fact, as we reported earlier this week, Warren didn\'t specifically mention Amazon in her public remarks when commenting on the need for stronger antitrust enforcement.On this episode of the GeekWire Podcast, we tell the behind-the-scenes story of how we were able to ask Warren about the issue by matching her sheer endurance. We also discuss why the call to break up big tech hasn\'t taken hold as a major campaign issue.\xa0In other topics, we discuss privacy concerns over Ring\'s collaboration with law enforcement; the new trailer for Netflix\'s Bill Gates documentary, what the algorithms say about an iconic Nirvana song; and, of course, the latest on the elusive Popeyes chicken sandwich.\xa0 | New wireless Bluetooth headphones from Seattle startup Human are getting mixed reviews based on their appearance, and their initial starting price of $399 (which the company quickly dropped to a promotional price of $259). But their unique design, which completely envelops both ears, reflects a vision of the future in which technology will be melded to our bodies, and potentially to our minds.\xa0Plus: Jeff Bezos\' first Amazon job ad, 25 years later; A new Netflix documentary will go inside the mind of Bill Gates, and Alexa makes a "Jeopardy!" cameo. | Microsoft\'s partnership with Samsung promises smooth integration between Windows and the Galaxy Note10, and that was enough to convince GeekWire\'s Todd Bishop to dump his iPhone X in favor of the consumer electronics giant\'s new flagship device. But which of the two Note10 variations should he get? And what can he expect as he switches from on major smartphone platform to another?

This portfolio includes a program that essentially renders visible the frenetic RF activity that is going on in the space we occupy. Another program features the challenge of converting radar systems into communications channels. In yet another, Joe is striving to find better ways of leveraging the ever-growing reservoir of commercial and open-source satellite imagery to improve warfighters’ abilities to detect, monitor, and track what is going on, that is, to improve situational awareness. Joe also flies planes, skippers boats, skies, runs, and sometimes straps on a guitar to send acoustic waves into the same space hosting all of those electromagnetic waves that he cares so much about. \xa0 | \xa0In this episode of the Voices from DARPA podcast, Anne Fischer, a program manager since 2017 in the agency’s Defense Sciences Office (DSO), recounts how she has been applying a chemist’s mindset, which began taking hold in her as a child when her parents gave her a chemistry set, in her boundary-pushing portfolio of extreme-chemistry projects at DARPA. In one of them, she is overseeing research that could pump up the creativity and productivity of chemists by way of artificial intelligence that plans and optimizes molecule-making procedures and with automated equipment that synthesizes the actual molecules. In another of her projects, Fischer has her sights on molecule-based computing that could open the way to radically new and powerful ways to process information and store data. In yet another program, she is helping to develop one of the most unusual pickup trucks ever: it will have an engine that burns and destroys chemical warfare agents, producing power in the process. There’s plenty more to Fischer’s expansive molecular vision on the world and national defense.\xa0\xa0 | \xa0In this episode of the Voices from DARPA podcast, Paul “Rusty” Thomas, a program manager since 2017 in the Agency’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), chronicles how his several-decade career within the commercial space industry has taught him a thing or two about designing, manufacturing, launching, and operating more than 130 civilian and government satellites. At DARPA, he is bringing that background to bear on one of the Agency’s more ambitious space-technology projects, Blackjack, which upon completion could encompass a mesh-like network of thousands of small and inexpensive satellites for delivering global, all-the-time sensing, communications, and other national-security services. With boots-on-the-ground experience in Afghanistan, a pilot’s license, and a personal altitude of 6’8”, Rusty projects a larger-than-life persona, illuminated by an infectious sense of mission to innovate the way toward future-generation space technology.   \xa0 | \xa0In this episode of the Voices from DARPA podcast, Renee Wegrzyn, a program manager since 2016 in the Agency’s Biological Technologies Office (BTO), recounts the origins of her current interests in synthetic biology and genomics, both of them powerful frameworks for engineering biological systems for technological ends. Still wielding influence are her childhood days amidst Florida’s abundant wildlife, a science-hooked sister, and a high school field trip in which Renee encountered fossil mastodon teeth. Her subsequent experience in the biotechnology industry got her hooked on the versatile power of combining biology and engineering in ways that can produce new medical technologies, materials, and other products. Along the way, Wegrzyn recounts what for her was a “Sputnik moment” in biology, based on the emergence of the celebrity gene-editing toolset known for short as CRISPR, which has underwritten an immensely powerful genetic and genomic engineering framework. Under Renee’s DARPA programs, Living Foundries and Safe Genes, researchers are innovating new means of manipulating and leveraging biology’s ways of eliciting traits in organisms and of making molecules and materials while also developing means for keeping those same bioengineering capabilities in check to hedge against their misuse or unintended consequences. \xa0 | \xa0In this episode of the Voices from DARPA podcast, David Gunning chronicles his three tours of duty as a DARPA program manager (PM), including his latest tour with the Agency’s Information Innovation Office. Throughout his DARPA service, David has combined his training and interests in computer science and psychology in ways that have extended the boundaries of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, both for warfighters and for the general public. During his first tour as a PM in the 90’s, he managed a portfolio of AI projects including the Command Post of the Future (CPoF) program, which delivered technology that was later adopted by the US Army as its Command and Control system for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. During his previous tour, from 2003-2008, David managed the Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) program that later led to Siri, perhaps the most famous virtual personal assistant. Now, in his third tour, he is aiming for a new generation of artificial intelligences that earn the confidence of their human users by being able to explain the decisions and actions that emerge from their internal computation. David is delighted that as he works to expand the frontiers of AI, he also will have the privilege of participating in the emergence of a more familiar variety of intelligence in his first grandson, who lives nearby.\xa0 | \xa0\xa0In this episode of Voices from DARPA, COL Matthew Hepburn, a program manager since 2013 with the Agency’s Biological Technologies Office (BTO), explains how his urgent ambition to develop ways and means of disarming current and emerging infectious and pandemic diseases—think here of Ebola, influenza, and Chikungunya—has led to a portfolio of go-for-the-gold programs that ultimately could reduce human suffering by an immeasurable degree. A biomedical engineer, physician, and global disease fighter by training and experience, Matt has known since he was a child that taking care of people was going to be his mission and he says DARPA is a place where he might be able to carry out that childhood dream to an extreme that would not be possible elsewhere. \xa0 | In this episode of Voices from DARPA, electrical engineer Kerry Bernstein, a program manager since 2012 with the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s Microsystems Technology Office (MTO), chronicles how his decades of experience in the trenches of the microelectronics manufacturing world drives what he does at DARPA. He is all about ensuring the reliability and integrity of the microelectronic chips the country needs and uses in just about every military and civilian setting you can think of. With electronics manufacturing distributed over so many countries and manufacturing facilities now, the threat of tampering, counterfeiting, and other nefarious actions has become more complex and in need of management than ever. For his part, Bernstein has been shepherding the development of some of the highest technology there is—in tiny glitter-sized packages, no less—to keep our electronics supply chain safe and sound.\xa0 | In this episode of Voices from DARPA, physicist Rosa Alejandra “Ale” Lukaszew, a program manager who is just finishing her first year with the Agency’s Defense Sciences Office (DSO), recounts how her interest in quantum phenomena took root at the age of 10 when already she could write down the equations of uncertainty. Now, at DARPA, she is channeling what became a lifelong fascination with fundamental physics into opening new pathways toward understanding and harnessing electronic ensembles and the correlated ways these diminutive entities “spin” and otherwise behave in various material settings. In her role as a program manager, Ale would like to make it possible for the researchers working on her DARPA programs to forge next-generation paradigms in electronics for applications in memory, logic, energy conversion devices, and sensors.\xa0 | In this episode of Voices from DARPA, sociocultural anthropologist Adam Russell, a program manager with the Agency’s Defense Sciences Office (DSO), discusses his vision for a range of technologies that could help usher in a next-generation social science. At the crux of this future view are novel experimental designs, practices, and tools to tackle research challenges that traditionally have limited the value of social science for national security. Russell believes these advances may help yield scientific results that are far more reliable, validated, predictive, and otherwise valuable for making decisions and basing actions than has been the case to date. Among the emerging and morphing issues that affect national security, and for which Russell says new approaches in social sciences might help, is the way modern environments can impact social identities and the choices people and groups make based on those identities. Contributing to his own self identifications, and to his cognitive style as a scientist, are his experiences as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University and a national-level rugby player.\xa0 \xa0 | In this episode of Voices from DARPA, Jim Galambos, a program manager with the Agency’s Strategic Technology Office (STO), talks about the opportunities and challenges of rethinking military platforms like submarines and aircraft as systems of systems, much as a human body can be thought of as a system of circulatory, neurological, sensory, musculoskeletal, and other subsystems. The system-of-systems paradigm, Galambos says, is a pathway toward military assets that can be more versatile, agile, evolvable, tailorable, survivable, and otherwise capable than previous generations of platforms. He also discusses the value that informative failure can have for achieving ambitious successes. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0", 'chan_desc': 'DARPA’s podcast series, "Voices from DARPA," offers a revealing and informative window on the minds of the Agency\'s program managers. In each episode, a program manager from one of DARPA’s six technical offices—Biological Technologies, Defense Sciences, Information Innovation, Microsystems Technology, Strategic Technology, and Tactical Technology—will discuss in informal and personal terms why they are at DARPA and what they are up to. The goal of "Voices from DARPA" is to share with listeners some of the institutional know-how, vision, process, and history that together make the “secret sauce” DARPA has been adding to the Nation’s innovation ecosystem for nearly 60 years.

This is done in the Settings under Accessibility, VoiceOver and then down to Commands. We will then go into the Touch Gestures.  Settings Accessibility Voiceover Commands Touch gestures Choose a Gesture Choose a Command  The commands are grouped by the type of gesture: and with the toggle setting set on headings, you can\xa0\xa0swipe through the headings for the\xa0\xa0gesture groups. 1 finger, 2 finger, 3 finger and so on. If there is an action for the gesture, that will be announced. If no announcement, then that gesture is free for assigning an action. In this demonstration we will add a command/action to the\xa0\xa02 finger quadruple tap That is, using 2 fingers and tapping 4 times on the screen. You will notice the vast amount of commands/actions available and there groupings You can really get overwhelmed with the numerous options available and so I suggest and demonstrate using the search option. I will type in Status and the search populates some commands and I choose, “Move to Status Bar”. What is really nice is that once you tap on the command that turned up in the search, the process is done! Another gesture that may be a popular choice as one to change is the Rotate (twist) gesture. This is called the rotor and the heading is called Rotate Heading. Our 2nd\xa0demonstration will walk you through the step to change the Rotate gesture to the 2 finger swipe right and left gestures. Remember that when you want to change a gesture, you start out by going to the gesture\xa0\xa0you want to use and then pick the action that you want to occur.

However, my dear listeners, was there really much for the picking? There were a couple of low hanging fruit and some elusive ones that never showed up. We decided to slice up the apples and add some filler and make some apple crisp. Yes, the crumbley kind at that. With iOS 13 ready to play with your accessibility, or maybe not, Apple already has thrown out a bone to us by letting everyone know when iOS 13.1 will be out. Sept. 29 so they say. What’s up Apple? From Apple Card, Apple Pay, Carrier prices and Apple trade ins, we manage to squeeze in some fantasy right away, Fantasy Football that is.\xa0\xa0But hey, Arcade is all about games right? Accessible Games? Hmmm. We don’t go all nutso over the Apple pickings but we give our experience and views on the latest blossoms from the big old Apple tree. With a bit of love and laugh, Serina, Brian and Jeff bob for apples and whatever else comes out of their mouth I guess. But really, there are some good deals and price points for students and parents of students looking to outfit their youngins. So kick back and enjoy the attempt we make in getting a podcast out while we are all busy doing other things. Well, at least we don’t just sit in the orchard all cast, we even talked about… umm… ok, we didn’t fall far from the tree. Have a great day and see you all on the next That Blind Tech Show when Brian will know how to turn a simple knob and put it back at 12 o’clock. Maybe Serina is expecting too much? Rocket science?
