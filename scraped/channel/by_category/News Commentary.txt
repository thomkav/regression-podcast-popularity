Plus: Kara dares Twitter to take responsibility for President Trump’s Tweets, and The Big Dog adopts a puppy. | Kara and Scott are live at the Elevate in Toronto -- Pivot\'s first international appearance! They talk about the continued implosion at weWork and CEO Adam Neumann stepping down. They ask -- have we reached peak "founder"? Wins are whistleblowers and Phoebe Waller-Bridge who is helping Amazon outpace Netflix in streaming content.\xa0 | Happy 1st anniversary to Pivot! Kara and Scott talk about weWork\'s halted IPO (we\'ll take partial credit). They talk about Amazon manipulating its algorithm to present more of its own products in search. Facebook is making its own "Supreme Court", is it just a band-aid? Should Kara Swisher be one of the Justices? (Yes). Fail: Trudeau -- and the (STILL) Governor of Virginia -- wearing black face. | Scott joins Land of the Giants host, Jason Del Rey, live on stage at the Code Commerce conference in New York City. Scott tells Jason that Amazon needs to be broken up - and which parts of the company should be spun off first. They discuss Amazon’s ultimate impact on us as consumers, who are the companies left that can really compete with Amazon, and question the idea that we live in an era of innovation.\xa0 | Kara and Scott talk at the annual Lesbians Who Tech Summit in New York City.

Kara comes with her new augmented reality glasses -- she thinks they\'re the future, Scott disagrees. WeWork\'s biggest investor encouraged them not to go forward with their IPO -- it\'s either because Pivot has gone so hard after them or because their S-1 is utter nonsense.

This week, Scott gets pushback from a listener in Minnesota on his Tesla views.

Meanwhile, Scott\'s planning to buy Uzbekistan. Kara and Scott both think DoorDash taking tip money from its delivery people is a fail -- DoorDash, Pivot is watching you.

But, the staff writer Adam Gopnik finds, the elderly are poorly served by the field of design, whether it’s a screw-top plastic bottle or the transportation system of a major city. Gopnik visited the M.I.T. Age Lab, where he tried on a special suit that simulates the pains and difficulties of advanced age for research purposes. And, to put the issues in context, he called a much older friend: the painter Wayne Thiebaud, who, at ninety-eight, is still leading an active career and is preparing for an upcoming exhibition. Plus, the writer Elizabeth Strout has set many of her books in Maine, including “Olive Kitteridge.” She brought us to one of her favorite haunts: a steep hill on her college campus, where she would sit and look out over the world.\xa0 And in a new sketch by Colin Nissan, a routine call for technical support leads to a chilling transformation.  | David Remnick asks five New Yorker contributors about the nascent impeachment proceedings against the President. Susan Glasser, the magazine’s Washington correspondent, notes that Republicans have attacked the inquiry but have not exactly defended the substance of Trump’s phone call to Zelensky. Joshua Yaffa, who has been reporting from Kiev, notes Ukraine’s disappointment in the conduct of the American President; Jane Mayer describes how an impeachment scenario in the era of Fox News could play out very differently than it did in the age of Richard Nixon; Jelani Cobb reflects on the likelihood of violence; and Jill Lepore argues that, regardless of the outcome, impeachment is the only constitutional response to Donald Trump’s actions. “This is the Presidential equivalent of shooting someone on Fifth Avenue,” she tells Remnick.\xa0 | Senator Cory Booker burst onto the national scene about a decade ago, after serving as the mayor of the notoriously impoverished and dangerous city of Newark, New Jersey. To get that job, Booker challenged an entrenched establishment. “My political training comes from the roughest of rough campaigns,” he tells David Remnick. “You just won’t think it’s America, the kind of stuff we had to go up against. And it [was] such a great way to learn [that campaigning] has to be retail—grassroots. And so much of this, in those early primary states, is about that.”\xa0Booker spoke with Remnick about growing up black in a largely white area of New Jersey, where his parents had to fight to be able to buy a home; about his long relationship with the Kushner family, which started back when Jared Kushner’s father, Charles, was a leading Democratic donor; and why he’s proud to collaborate with even his direst political opponents on issues such as criminal-justice reform. “Donald Trump signed my bill,” Booker states. “I worked with him and his White House to pass a bill that liberated thousands of black people from prison” by retroactively reducing unjustly high sentences related to crack cocaine. “Tell that liberated person that Cory Booker should not deal with somebody that he fundamentally disagrees with.”\xa0Note: In this interview, Senator Booker asserts, “We now have more African-Americans in this country under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850.” The historical accuracy of this comparison has been challenged. More accurately, the number of African-American men under criminal supervision today has been compared to the number of African-American men enslaved in 1850.\xa0 | It was just seven years ago that Washington and Colorado became the first states to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Today the drug is legal in eleven states and counting, with polls showing that sixty per cent of Americans support its legalization. How did that happen so fast? This episode of The New Yorker Radio Hour looks at the end of reefer madness—and the early days of corporate cannabis. Bruce Barcott talks about the politics and the public-health aspects of legalization; Jelani Cobb looks at how legalization tries to undo the decades of harm that marijuana prohibition has done to communities of color; Sue Halpern drives around Vermont, where weed is the new zucchini; and Jia Tolentino shares the joy of watching David Attenborough under the influence.\xa0 | Alabama Shakes started out playing covers at local gigs but quickly found a unique personal voice rooted in rock and soul. The band came to national attention, found a wide and devoted public, and soon earned four Grammys, for the album “Sound and Color.” But after that record, their second, Brittany Howard—who sings, plays guitar, and writes songs for the group—announced that she was putting Alabama Shakes on hiatus, to work on a solo album. “We sat and we talked about it for several hours; we sat in a circle,” she recalls. “At the end of the conversation, everybody was, like, ‘O.K., we understand. We get it.’ They gave me their blessing to go on and find what I needed to find or create what I needed to create.” Howard gathered a different group of musicians, including the keyboard superstar Robert Glasper, to back her up on a solo album, called “Jamie.” It’s named after Howard’s late sister, but it’s very much about the singer herself—her passions, her concerns, and her upbringing, in Athens, Alabama. Is this, David Remnick asks, the end of Alabama Shakes? “I don’t know,” Howard says, after a pause. “Wherever creativity leads my ship, I can’t force it. That’s the thing. Once I start forcing it, it’s not going to be no good, anyway.”\xa0\xa0 | An exodus is under way in the House of Representatives: not even halfway into the congressional term, fifteen Republicans have announced that they will not run in 2020. One of the exiting members is Will Hurd, a former C.I.A. officer who was elected in 2014. His district in Texas includes nearly a third of the state’s border with Mexico. Although he is reluctant to criticize the G.O.P. directly, Hurd tells the Washington correspondent\xa0Susan B. Glasser\xa0that he thinks the President’s border policy is ineffective: a wall isn’t the answer, Border Patrol is underfunded relative to the area it covers, and the technology in use for border security is both out of date and overly complicated, “requiring a Ph.D. in computer science to operate,” he says. “I wish I could pass a piece of legislation,” Hurd tells Glasser, “that says you can’t talk about the border unless you’ve been down to the border a few times.” Hurd’s departure is particularly significant because he is—for the sixteen months he has left to serve—the only African-American in the House Republican caucus, and he worries that the President’s negative rhetoric toward people of color is contributing to a demographic shift that’s turning Texas from deep red to purple. “When you have statements the equivalent of, ‘go back to Africa,’ ” Hurd notes, “that is not helpful.”\xa0Plus, two leading environmental writers, Bill McKibben and Elizabeth Kolbert, wonder if the new sense of urgency around climate change is coming too late.\xa0\xa0\xa0 | Vjeran Tomic has been stealing since he was a small child, when he used a ladder to break into a library in his home town, in Bosnia. After moving to Paris, he graduated to lucrative apartment burglaries, living off the jewels he took and often doing time in prison. He became known in the French press as Spider-Man, and he began to steal art. Tomic has a grand sense of his calling as a burglar; he considers it his destiny and has described his robberies as acts of imagination. He eventually carried a truly epic heist: a break-in at the Musée d’Art Moderne, in Paris, in which he left with seventy million dollars’ worth of paintings. But selling these masterpieces proved harder than stealing them, and that’s where Spider-Man’s troubles began. The contributor Jake Halpern tells Vjeran Tomic’s story; excerpts from Tomic’s letters from prison are read by the actor Jean Brassard.\xa0\xa0 | The New Yorker’s fiction editor, Deborah Treisman, talks with Salman Rushdie about “Quichotte,” his apocalyptic quest novel. A few years ago, when the four hundredth anniversary of “Don Quixote” was being celebrated, Rushdie reread Cervantes’s book and found himself newly engaged by a much improved translation. He immediately began thinking of writing his own story about a “silly old fool,” like Quixote, who becomes obsessed with an unattainable woman and undertakes a quest to win her love. This character became Quichotte (named for the French opera loosely based on “Don Quixote”), who is seeking the love of—or, as she sees it, stalking—a popular talk-show host. As Quichotte journeys to find her, he encounters the truths of contemporary America: the opioid epidemic, white supremacy, the fallout from the War on Terror, and more. “I’ve always really liked the risky thing of writing very close up against the present moment,” Rushdie tells Treisman. “If you do it wrong, it’s a catastrophe. If you do it right, with luck, you somehow capture a moment.” At the same time, the novel gives full rein to Rushdie’s fantastical streak—at one point, for instance, Quichotte comes across a New Jersey town where people turn into mastodons. Treisman talks with the author about the influence of science fiction on his imagination, and about his personal connection to the tragedy of opioids. Rushdie’s much younger sister died from the consequences of addiction, and the book is centrally concerned with siblings trying to reconnect after separation.  | Mischele Lewis learned that her fiancé was a con man and a convicted pedophile. By lying about who he was, did he violate her consent, and commit assault? Lewis’s story raises a larger question: What is consent, and how do we give it? It’s currently the standard by which the law regulates sexual behavior, but the continuing prevalence of harassment and assault has led many college campuses to adopt more stringent standards. At the core of many new rules is the principle of affirmative consent: that sexual partners must verbally and explicitly express their acceptance of each and every sexual overture. The problem is that few of us use affirmative consent—even many of its advocates find it cumbersome in practice. Alondra Nelson, a professor of sociology and the president of the Social Science Research Council, explores this shifting of sexual norms with The New Yorker’s Joshua Rothman. They spoke with the legal scholars Jeannie Suk Gersen and Jacob Gersen, and with the facilitator of cuddle parties, who compares her nonsexual events to “going to the gym for consent.”\xa0Plus, an interview with a climate striker. Inspired by Greta Thunberg, fourteen-year-old Alexandria Villaseñor spends her Fridays outside the United Nations, demanding action on climate change. But the risk of “eco-grief” is high, she tells the reporter Carolyn Kormann. | Marianne Williamson, the self-help author associated with the New Age movement, has never held political office. But the race for the Presidency, she thinks, is less a battle of politics than a battle of souls. In her appearance in the July Democratic debates, she said that President Donald Trump is bringing up a “dark psychic force.” “The worst aspects of human character have been harnessed for political purposes,” she tells David Remnick. Williamson sees herself as a kind of spiritual counter to Trump, reshaping our moral trajectory. And she does have policies, which include repealing the 2017 tax cut and an ambitious plan for slavery reparations, and also tapping some surprising people for her Cabinet. Campaigning on her credentials hasn’t been easy: she’s had to debunk some myths and clarify some statements. She is not an anti-vaxxer, she insists—she apologizes for her earlier remarks on the subject—or a medical skeptic. “I’m Jewish,” she says, “I go to the doctor.” She does not, she says, even have a crystal in her home. “I know this sounds naïve,” she complains, but “I didn’t think the left was so mean. I didn’t think the left lied like this.”\xa0\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'David Remnick is joined by The New Yorker’s award-winning writers, editors and artists to present a weekly mix of profiles, storytelling, and insightful conversations about the issues that matter — plus an occasional blast of comic genius from the magazine’s legendary Shouts and Murmurs page.

After all, by keeping ownership of that business, Trump has had dueling interests: the country and his pocketbook.\xa0We\'ve done dozens of episodes over the past 18 months, detailing how predatory lenders are\xa0paying the president, how Trump has profited from\xa0his own inauguration\xa0and how Trump\'s friends have sought to use their\xa0access\xa0in\xa0pursuit of\xa0profit.\xa0We\'ve noticed something along the way. It\'s not just that the president has mixed his business and governing. It\'s that the\xa0way\xa0Trump does business is spreading across the government.\xa0Trump\'s company isn\'t like most big businesses. It is accountable to only one man, it has\xa0broken the rules, and those promoting it have long engaged in what Trump has dubbed"truthful\xa0hyperbole."Those traits are now popping up in the government. It may seem like the news from Washington is a cacophony of scandals. But they fit clear patterns — patterns that Trump has brought with him from his business.\xa0\xa0 | Good riddance, John Bolton!

But they did offer safe haven in Afghanistan to Al Qaeda, whose hijackers turned passenger airplanes into bombs in the most deadly act of terrorism on US soil. A few weeks later, America invaded the central Asian crossroads whose history has been one of occupation. "Today we focus on Afghanistan, but the battle is broader," President George Bush said at the time. "Every nation has a choice to make. In this conflict, there is no neutral ground. If any government sponsors the outlaws and killers of innocence, they have become outlaws and murderers themselves. And they will take that lonely path at their own peril."\xa0The whole world understood. Or, almost the whole world.

Have they been invoked more frequently in recent years, and, if so, how is that affecting how laws or executive orders are implemented nationwide? And is the term “nationwide injunctions” itself actually a misnomer? Two experts on these broad kinds of injunctions, Amanda Frost of American University’s Washington College of Law and Howard Wasserman of Florida International University, answer those questions. They also detail how nationwide injunctions have been used to block policies of both President Obama and President Trump – including immigration policies like DAPA and DACA under President Obama, and the so-called “travel ban” and third country asylum rule under President Trump – as well as civil rights policies like President Obama’s protections for transgender students using bathrooms that match their identities and President Trump’s ban on people with gender dysphoria serving in the military.

It centers around a New York City regulation prohibiting residents from taking their guns to second homes and shooting ranges outside the city, even when the guns are unloaded and separated from ammunition. New York’s NRA affiliate and some gun-owning residents challenged the regulation, but, in the midst of litigation, New York City changed it – raising the question of whether the case was now “moot”. And, Senate Democrats filed a controversial brief addressed to the Supreme Court warning that they might pursue structural reform of the Court if they don’t like the outcome in this case.

There are three main levels in constitutional law: \xa0Strict scrutiny: For a law to survive a court’s review under strict scrutiny, it must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interestIntermediate Scrutiny: A level down from strict scrutiny. The law must be substantially related to an important government interest.Rational basis review: The most deferential kind of review to the legislature. A law only has to be “rationally related” to a “legitimate” government interest.\xa0Questions or comments about the podcast?

Each man argued that he was the heir to the Founders’ legacy as enshrined by the Constitution, as they battled over slavery, popular sovereignty, the nature of rights, and the future of the union.

On this episode, we explore the questions: How did the unique constitutional visions of the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists influence the drafting and ratification of the Constitution? And how should we interpret the Constitution in light of those debates today?

The court held that because President Trump controls access to his @realdonaldtrump Twitter account and uses it for official government purposes, it is a public forum and, under the First Amendment, he cannot block people solely based on their viewpoints. Katie Fallow – one of the lead attorneys who represented the blocked Twitter users in the case – and David French, senior writer at National Review and former First Amendment litigator, debate the merits of the decision as well as its potential impact on future cases. They also explore a similar lawsuit recently filed against Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by people claiming that she unconstitutionally blocked them on Twitter.

People care most about their communities. President Trump has an opportunity to run on letting the people decide whether their communities should be transformed by refugees and illegal immigration. We use the case study of Worthington, Minnesota, to show how whenever the people get to decide their future, they reject social transformation of their communities.\xa0I also touch on how Trump never supported the dumb jailbreak bill pushed on him by son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and how Trump can also harness “localism” by returning to tough on crime policies. If Trump keeps to this message and stays with winning policies, the American people will laugh off impeachment and it will backfire on Democrats. But if not, Republicans will not have much of a narrative to use headed into the 2020 election.Show Links:\xa0'Washington Post proves our point about ill effects of refugee resettlement:' https://bit.ly/2muhFFa'Trump reportedly regrets listening to Jared on jailbreak:' https://bit.ly/2ltk16X\xa0 | The crime wave throughout the country is getting worse every day, particularly with juveniles who walk the streets in packs and senselessly beat innocent victims. Today, we are joined by Frederick County, Maryland, Sheriff Chuck Jenkins, one of the last men who still believe in law and order, to discuss the absolutely horrific knockout attack that occurred at his county fair in broad daylight that resulted in the death of an innocent man. He believes that we simply are not deterring criminals anymore because of our increasingly weak justice system.Jenkins is also a leader in the 287(g) immigration enforcement program, which ensures that illegal aliens arrested for crimes are turned over to ICE. He explains how he has successfully removed nearly 1,530 illegal alien criminals, many of them gang members, who are now out of the country and can no longer harm more people.

Do you want to know how to be an alpha and not a beta personality? Do you struggle with vices, addictions, or habits like alcohol, pornography, or sexual deviancy? Jesse Lee Peterson from Fallen State joins me today to talk about the depravity in our culture that is trying to make us WEAK people\xa0— and how to overcome our natures and become better and stronger individuals. | Los Angeles has fallen. I’m not joking when I say that. Homelessness is rising faster than the city can keep up, drugs are rampant, the water is polluted, soil is beyond repair, and the people are desperate. Austen Fletcher, host of Fleccas Talks, joins me today to discuss why we both moved out of Los Angeles and why we are never going back. | I got into an online battle with Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who said that I should be red-flagged and am a good example of why we need those laws that take firearms away from law-abiding citizens. Why? It\'s because I told him that I would fight against a tyrannical government that would seek to violate its own charter and the Constitution of the United States. He wasn\'t having it and showed me firsthand how certain prominent Democrats would usurp power from citizens if elected to office. | The argument over whether or not women should have the right to vote or hold political office is a hot one. So why would I bring someone on who agrees with me on the issue? That would be boring. Instead, I invited none other than the infamous and extremely controversial Nick Fuentes, who holds a very different position on the matter from mine. While some may be offended by his views and remarks, I find it helpful to challenge one\'s views by constantly speaking with others who hold different worldviews that we may find wacky and sometimes downright offensive or wrong. Either way, it\'s important to intellectual discussion to have these kinds of talks despite the outrage that may ensue. | Violence broke out Saturday as the domestic terrorist group, Antifa, destroyed the streets of Portland. We were there to show the world a side of things they didn\'t see. | While the majority of hispanics (and minorities) in general vote left, the left doesn\'t care about them. When you look at it, the hispanic "vote" in the United States is exactly that to Democrats, a vote. After elections, politicians stop looking at the issues that matter to hispanics and begin focusing solely on illegals. However, there are emerging conservative and centrist groups like Bienvenido (Spanish for "welcome") that are beginning to empower young hispanics to vote Republican so that their communities grow in strength and values rather than rely on the government for help.\xa0 | While the liberal/corporate media enjoys interviewing and labeling anyone they consider not in line with the radical progressive agenda as a far right neo-nazi, they are almost 100% of the time wrong. However, there is one host that is rising the ranks in the fringe conservative movement that both worries and fascinates the left and right due to his outlandish rhetoric mixed and contagious appeal to younger generations. The Daily Wire calls him a white nationalist, Vice labeled him anti-Semitic, and I was told I shouldn\'t interview him. However, with his growing voice and appeal to younger generations I had to find out for myself: "Who is Nick Fuentes and why are people so afraid of him?" | This is not a video attacking any specific person, group, organization, or company. Nowhere in this video are we talking about exact occurrences of e-girls watering down the center, center right, and conservative movements, but instead are trying to understand how this new trend of young people entering positions of influence without any merit (mostly due to their attractive selfies and high follower counts) is changing the way young people engage in the political sphere. We took a very light hearted and fun approach to this topic with none other than Sydney Watson herself who holds this topic very near and dear to her heart. If you or a friend believes that you are suffering with symptoms of being an e-girl or enabling one, please consider seeking help and changing your ways and genuinely contributing to the betterment of this country. Redemption is always available for those who seek it.\xa0 | PragerU personality, Will Witt, joins me in studio to discuss a new Pew research study that determines a new civil war happening soon. Is this real life? We will find out! | Modern day (3rd Wave) feminism is a joke to many, but what are feminists really saying online and how are they targeting new recruits to join their sexist, man-hating army? Kezia Schaffer , also known as Krocs On, joins me in Studio today to debunk the propaganda feminists are using on Instagram to promote their baseless ideology.

She was arrested four times and held as a prisoner of conscience in a labor camp for a year. In the camp, she was physically and mentally abused, and subjected to attempted brainwashing and electroshock treatment. She fled China in 2001 for Australia, wrote a book about her experiences titled\xa0Witnessing History: One Chinese Woman's Fight for Freedom.\xa0She eventually settled in the United States. There is also a documentary about her life called\xa0Free China: The Courage to Believe.\xa0Jennifer is a managing editor at Epoch Times. | America’s Founders understood the press as both a necessary component of republican government and a potential threat to political liberty. They counted on libel laws to restrain the press’s natural excesses. But the Supreme Court dramatically changed the nature of libel law in its landmark 1964 decision,\xa0New York Times v. Sullivan. How has this ruling changed the character of America’s press, and what have been long term consequences of this ruling? Should this decision be revisited? Please join us as our panel of experts consider whether stronger libel laws against the press should be revived. | The U.S. Marine Corps stands on the brink of revolutionary change, driven by General David H. Berger, 38th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Just six days after taking office this summer, General Berger issued his Commandant’s Planning Guidance, in which he made a bold break from long-held imperatives that have driven the Corps’ organizing, acquisition, doctrinal, and training efforts for a half-century. Agreeing with his predecessor’s assessment that “The Marine Corps is not organized, trained, equipped, or postured” for the future, General Berger has laid out an audacious plan to reorient the Corps and design a force to meet the demands of Great Power Competition and future war.Join us for an in-depth conversation with the Commandant, in his first presentation for the general public, to gain greater insight into why he believes such dramatic change is needed, his orientation of the Corps to the Indo-Pacific, how the service plans to move forward, and what it implies not only for the Marines, but also for the U.S. Navy, the defense industrial base, and the ability of operational commanders to meet rapidly evolving future threats. Reception to follow.The Marine Corps University Foundation is a nonprofit organization created to enhance and enrich the Marine Corps’ Professional Military Education and Leadership. For nearly 40 years, MCUF has harnessed the power of the private sector in support of the Marine Corps’ most pressing educational needs. | When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, limits on NASA funding and the lack of direction under the Nixon and Carter administrations had left the U.S. space program at a crossroads. In contrast to his predecessors, Reagan saw outer space as humanity’s final frontier and as an opportunity for global leadership. His optimism and belief in American exceptionalism guided a decade of U.S. activities in space, including bringing the space shuttle into operation, dealing with the 1986 Challenger accident and its aftermath, committing to a permanently crewed space station, encouraging private sector space efforts, and fostering international space partnerships with both U.S. allies and with the Soviet Union.Drawing from a trove of declassified primary source materials and oral history interviews, John M. Logsdon provides the first comprehensive account of Reagan’s civilian and commercial space policies during his eight years in the White House. Even as a fiscal conservative who was hesitant to increase NASA’s budget, Reagan’s enthusiasm for the space program made him perhaps the most pro-space president in American history.John Logsdon\xa0is a world-renowned historian and analyst of space issues. He is the author of\xa0John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon\xa0and\xa0After Apollo? Richard Nixon and the American Space Program, both award-winning, definitive accounts of presidential space policy, and his most recent book is\xa0Ronald Reagan and the Space Frontier. Professor Logsdon is Professor Emeritus at the George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs and founder of its Space Policy Institute. | Public diplomacy in the era of President Trump has been a subject of much conjecture. It has focused, to a great extent, on the president’s promise to “Make America Great Again” and how that idea is received around the world. Yet, little factual information has come out about the significant changes in Public Diplomacy’s place within the Department of State. Under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, streamlining and reorganization has been taking place. Most notably, State’s Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Bureaus have merged to form a Bureau of Global Public Affairs, whose mission is simultaneously to “serve the American people by effectively communicating U.S. foreign policy priorities and the importance of diplomacy to American audiences, and engaging foreign publics to enhance their understanding of and support for the values and policies of the United States.” Furthermore, some priorities have shifted to align priorities with President Trump’s National Security Strategy. In order to examine and analyze these changes, The Heritage Foundation will host a discussion with some of the key players in the Trump Administration’s Public Diplomacy work. | The Supreme Court returns October 7th for its 2019-2020 Term, and the justices will tackle of number of important issues. The Court will consider cases involving an Obamacare “bait and switch” on insurance companies in\xa0Moda Health Plan, Inc. v. United States\xa0and the Trump administration’s attempt to roll back the DACA program for Dreamers in\xa0Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California. Also coming up are cases looking at whether the federal ban on sex-based discrimination in employment extends to sexual orientation and gender identity in a trio of cases, whether states can bar religious schools from a student-aid program in\xa0Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, and the first major Second Amendment case in nearly a decade in\xa0New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York. In addition to these and many others, what other cases might the justices add to their calendar? Join us as two distinguished Supreme Court advocates discuss what is likely to unfold at the Supreme Court next term. | The genius of Western civilization is its unique synthesis of reason and faith. But today that synthesis is under attack—from the East by radical Islam (faith without reason) and from within the West itself by aggressive secularism (reason without faith). The stakes are incalculably high.We can all see that faith without reason is benighted at best, fanatical and violent at worst. But too many forget that reason, stripped of faith, is subject to its own pathologies. A supposedly autonomous reason easily sinks into fanaticism, stifling dissent as bigoted and irrational and devouring the humane civilization fostered by the integration of reason and faith. The blood-soaked history of the twentieth century attests to the totalitarian forces unleashed by corrupted reason.But Samuel Gregg does more than lament the intellectual and spiritual ruin caused by the divorce of reason and faith. He shows that each of these foundational principles corrects the other’s excesses and enhances our comprehension of the truth in a continuous renewal of civilization. By recovering this balance, we can avoid a suicidal winner-take-all conflict between reason and faith and a future that will respect neither. | The Heritage Foundation is honored to host Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) for our signature event on U.S. policy in the Indo-Pacific. Heritage’s annual B.C. Lee Lecture on international affairs was endowed by the Samsung Group in honor of its founder, the late B.C. Lee, to focus on the U.S. relationship with the Indo-Pacific. Senator Sullivan continues the B.C. Lee tradition of speakers representing leading voices in America’s Asia policy. Previous lectures have been delivered by Henry Kissinger, Jesse Helms, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Joseph Lieberman, Ed Royce, Robert Zoellick, John McCain, and many others. We look forward to hearing Senator Sullivan’s views on Indo-Pacific policy in what is a very challenging time for American interests. Please join us for another enlightening event in this series. | Vice President Pence discusses\xa0the way forward on President Trump’s trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. | Undermining the courts’ independence was among the actions by King George III that was cited to justify America’s separation from Great Britain. Alexander Hamilton wrote that an independent judiciary is “peculiarly essential” for our system of government. In 1937, a heavily Democratic Congress rejected President Franklin Roosevelt’s plan to restructure the judiciary in response to “reactionary” decisions. An independent judiciary has helped to safeguard liberty in our country, while remaining illusory in other countries. Yet today, certain political forces threaten to “pack” the Supreme Court or “restructure” the judiciary in response to what they call “politicized” decisions. These threats are becoming more direct, even finding their way into legal briefs filed with the very courts from which change is demanded. This event will focus on the meaning and importance of judicial independence and current threats to what the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist called one of the “crown jewels” of our system of government.", 'chan_desc': 'Founded in 1973, The Heritage Foundation is a research and educational institution—a think tank—whose mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/cd/9d/c0/cd9dc0ff-18d6-cb9a-e76d-13b1183ed9cd/mza_3944411706179334446.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2018-04-09'}}

Iraqi government forces and allied Kurdish militias with backing from the United States and other key international partners sought to re-take Mosul from ISIS, which captured the city two years earlier. Mosul is the second most populous city in Iraq. The fighting that ensued was the most intense urban warfare since World War Two. tThe liberating forces went neighborhood to neighborhood, house to house, to recapture territory. It took nearly a year, but eventually ISIS was evicted from Mosul in the summer of 2017. In a new book, the journalist James Verini embedded himself with the liberating forces and the civilians displaced by the fighting. He witnessed the fighting and its impact first-hand which he masterfully recounts in his new book: They Will Have to Die Now: Mosul and the Fall of the Caliphate.\xa0 On the podcast James Verini discusses the significance of this battle to both the fight against ISIS and the overall politics of the region. We kick off discussing the long history of Mosul and events leading up to its capture by ISIS and eventual liberation by Iraqi and allied forces. \xa0 \xa0 | Gulalai Ismail won\'t tell me how she came to New York. Doing so, she says, will put too many lives at risk.\xa0\xa0 Gulalai Ismail is a longtime human rights activist in Pakistan. Her organization, Aware Girls, helped to train the likes of Nobel Peace Prize Winner Malala\xa0Yousafzai and hundreds of other Pakistani girls, mostly in the very conservative parts of the country rife with Islamist militants. She has faced numerous death threats over the years for her outspoken promotion of the rights of women and girls, but it was not until she began speaking out against the Pakistani government that she felt compelled to flee the country.\xa0 \xa0 As she explains, she was put on a most wanted list for her leadership and participation in a protest movement this year seeking accountability for human rights abuses committed by the Pakistani security forces during counter-terrorism operations. This was when harassment and threats directly from the government forced her into hiding. \xa0 She publicly resurfaced in New York in September, where she is now seeking political asylum.\xa0 \xa0 https://www.patreon.com/GlobalDispatches \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0  | My guest today, Kumi Naidoo, is Secretary General of Amnesty International. He\'s a longtime activist and civil society leader who joined the anti-apartheid movement as a teenager and for many years lead Greenpeace.\xa0 In September, ahead of the UN Climate Summit, Amnesty International conferred its highest honor, the Ambassador of Conscience Award, to Greta Thunberg and the Friday\'s for the Future Movement. In this conversation I sought to draw out Kumi Naidoo\'s perspective as a longtime activist on this burgeoning transnational youth climate movement. That is the focus of much of our conversation in this episode.\xa0 We met in Amnesty\'s offices across the street from the United Nations, where days earlier hundreds of young people gathered for a Youth Climate Action summit.\xa0 From a UN perspective, this was a pretty interesting and unique event. And Secretary General Antonio Guterres was very transparent that he sought this kind of youth engagement as a means to pressure government to take more meaningful action on climate change. We kick off discussing what impact he\'s seen from this youth movement around the UN and beyond.\xa0 At times this conversation gets heavy. And I just want to thank Kumi Naidoo for both taking the time to speak during a very busy UNGA week and more importantly. \xa0 https://www.patreon.com/GlobalDispatches\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Around the United Nations you will often see CEOs of major companies participating in meetings and events around sustainability. Meaningful corporate participation is fairly commonplace at the United Nation these days. But this was certainly not the case ten years ago and more, when I\'d regularly see Hans Vestberg around the United Nations as one of the very few corporate leaders engaging on development and sustainability issues. Hans Vestberg is the CEO of Verizon and he is on the Global Dispatches podcast to discuss the role of 5G technologies in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. We kick off with a discussion about what exactly 5G is, and how it can be used to advance sustainable development. We then have a discussion about his own commitment to sustainability issues and how Verizon has integrated the Sustainable Development Goals into its corporate strategies. | \xa0 The United Nations General Assembly, better known as UNGA, kicks in New York this week.\xa0 Hundreds of heads of state, business and civil society leaders and dignitaries of all stripes will descend on the UN for a week of events, meetings, and of course speeches. UNGA is the single most important and action-packed week on the diplomatic calendar -- a behemoth of diplomatic events. On the line with me to preview the big stories that will drive the agenda at UNGA this year is Margaret Besheer, the UN correspondent for Voice of America, and Richard Gowan, the UN director of the International Crisis Group.\xa0 We discuss a key youth summit on climate, the UN Climate Action Summit, how tensions between the United States and Iran may shape events at UNGA, and many other key moments, events, and ideas to watch during UNGA.\xa0\xa0 If you have 25 minutes and want to learn the storylines that will drive the agenda at UNGA this year, have a listen.\xa0\xa0 https://patreon.com/GlobalDispatches\xa0\xa0 |  United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres discusses climate change in this special episode of the Global Dispatches podcast.\xa0 On Tuesday, September 17th Antonio Guterres sat down with Mark Hertsgaard of The Nation and Mark Phillips of CBS News for an interview conducted on behalf of Covering Climate Now. This is a\xa0global collaboration of over 250 news outlets, including the Global Dispatches Podcast and UN Dispatch, to strengthen coverage of the climate story. The interview with Antonio Guterres was conducted on behalf of all participating members of this coalition and I am glad to be able to present the podcast version of it to you.\xa0\xa0 If you are listening\xa0to this episode contemporaneously, I\'d encourage you to check out the episode I posted earlier this week that gets into a little more detail about the UN Climate Action Summit; and later this week, I will have an episode that previews all the big stories that will drive the agenda around the UN Week in New York.\xa0  After the interview concludes, I\'ll offer some short commentary about my big takeaways. I\'ve covered the UN for nearly 15 years and I think Antonio Guterres\' remarks in this interview for reasons I explain.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 If you are new to the podcast: welcome. Global Dispatches is a global affairs podcast that typically features my interviews with diplomats, NGOS leaders, policy experts journalists and academics all around topics of world concern. I encourage you to subscribe the show and check out our robust archive.\xa0 | \xa0  The UN General Assembly convenes at United Nations headquarters in New York next week. As in every year, UNGA is an annual opportunity for heads of state to come to the United Nations to meet each other and address the world.\xa0\xa0 What distinguishes the UN General Assembly this year is a series of key events and meetings focused on climate change. \xa0 Of these events and meetings the most high profile is what is known as the UN Climate Action Summit. This will take place on Monday the 23rd of September, and will include top government officials, business leaders, and civil society members bringing to the table concrete action plans to accelerate progress on addressing climate change.\xa0 \xa0 Today\'s episode of the Global Dispatches podcast is dedicated to explaining just what that Climate Action Summit entails and what to expect from this major climate meeting at the United Nations.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 On the line with me to discuss the significance of this summit and what it hopes to achieve is\xa0 Cassie Flynn, she is the strategic advisor on climate change in the executive office of the UN Development Program, UNDP. She is the someone who has very much been involved in aspects of planning the summit and in this conversation offers a curtain raiser for the summit itself, and discusses some of the broader expectations for this event.\xa0 \xa0 The Climate Action Summit at the UN is the capstone to several climate related events happening at the UN, including a Youth Climate Summit that will feature young leaders from around the world. In this conversation we discuss how these events relate to each other and directly to the Paris Climate Accord. \xa0 If you have twenty minutes and want to better understand the UN Climate Action Summit, have a listen.  \xa0 This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story. \xa0 \xa0 | In late August it appeared that the United States was very close to an agreement with the Taliban that would see US troops withdraw from the Afghanistan. Leading the negotiations on the US-side was Zalmay Khalilzad, a widely respected former US Ambassador to the UN who is an immigrant to the US from Afghanistan.\xa0 He also served as US Ambassador to Afghanistan shortly after the fall of the Taliban.\xa0 Significantly, these negotiations did not include the Afghan government, rather they were direct negotiations between the US and the Taliban.\xa0 By early September it appeared that the two sides had reached a deal. Then, on September 7th Donald Trump appeared to upend the deal in a tweet suggesting that a planned meeting between the US and Taliban at Camp David had been cancelled, apparently ending these talks. But then, days later, he fired National Security Advisor John Bolton who had largely opposed negotiating with the Taliban in the first place.\xa0 So where does this leave the peace process and negotiations for a US withdrawal from Afghanistan? And what happens next? On the line to discuss these questions and more is Daniel Serwer. He is a professor of conflict management and American foreign policy at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Study and a scholar at the Middle East Institute\xa0 Daniel Serwer has had a long career in and out of government participating in peace talks and peace building efforts around the world, including Afghanistan. We kick off discussing just what Zalmay Khalilzad was negotiating with the Taliban before having a longer conversation about how those talks broke down and what comes next. If you have 20 minutes and want to get up to speed on US diplomacy towards Afghanistan, then have a listen.\xa0 \xa0https://www.patreon.com/GlobalDispatches\xa0 \xa0 \xa0https://www.patreon.com/GlobalDispatches\xa0 \xa0 | Tanzania has long been recognized as stable country, generally more advanced in its democracy than many other countries in East Africa.\xa0To be sure, democracy in Tanzania was certainly imperfect and flawed. But there did exist a degree of press freedom, a robust civil society, and multiple political parties. Over the last few years, elements of Tanzanian democracy have been curtailed. The country is now in the midst of what scholars would call a democratic backslide. This occurs when the state uses its power to weaken institutions that sustain democracy, like civil society and a free press.\xa0 A key inflection point in this process was the 2015 election of President John Magufuli.\xa0Magufuli is very much a populist -- his nickname is "The Bulldozer." He came to power on a pledge to stamp out corruption but has also shown himself to be increasingly intolerant of dissent.\xa0 Since taking office he has enacted laws to severely restrict press freedoms; many journalists have been arrested, and political opponents silenced.\xa0 But according to my guest today, Constantine Manda, the process of democratic backsliding really began under the previous administration. Still, for reasons he explains in this episode, the erosions of have accelerated in recent months.\xa0 Constantine Manda is a Tanzanian national and a PHD candidate in the department of political science at Yale University.

What was a trade war escalated to the security realm last month when the South Korean government announced that it was pulling out of a key intelligence sharing agreement with Tokyo. This agreement enabled the real-time sharing of key intelligence as it related to common threats, including from North Korea.\xa0 Needless to say, amid a growing threat from North Korea, which is regularly testing missiles that could reach both countries, this dispute between South Korea and Japan poses a big risk for international security.\xa0 So why are two key US allies that share a common adversary at such loggerheads? And what does a frayed relationship between Seoul and Tokyo mean for regional security and international relations more broadly? On the line with me to answer these questions and more is Andrew Yeo, associate professor of politics at the Catholic University of America. We kick off talking through the World War Two era origins of this conflict before having a longer conversation about the global implications of a dispute between Japan and South Korea.\xa0 If you have twenty minutes and want to learn why historical grievances have become hyper-relevant in East Asia -- and why relations are poised to get worse between these two countries, have a listen.\xa0 \xa0   People often ask me what podcasts I most enjoy listening to and top of the list for me is "First Person" from Foreign Policy magazine.

Sharing their thoughts this week with host/producer Rick Harp are Kim TallBear, associate professor of Native Studies at the University of Alberta, and Candis Callison, Associate Professor at UBC\'s Graduate School of Journalism.

On its face, Indigenous identity would seem like it would be simple to understand who is and who isn’t First Nations, Inuit or Metis. That is, if you choose to look past the colonial elephant in the room. And yet, complicated and confusing as colonialism can make the identification process, it all comes down to knowing not only who claims which Nation or People—but which People or Nation claims them.

Last episode, we got into the colonial principles of Settler family forms and norms. This episode, we lay out how they are applied in practice, with Indigenous people often on the receiving end. And if the expression “What you believe in, you budget” holds true here, it would seem the Canadian state has never been one to believe in either Indigenous children or their families.

But is the Settler family form the only way to organize human relations? Does it matter that this dominant, mainstream form differs from those of Indigenous peoples? The answers to these questions are critical, for they are at the heart of why Canada’s child and family welfare systems have failed Indigenous children and families. And yet, as you’ll hear in this episode, what is a failure to some is of benefit to others, on a truly massive scale.

The 27-member commission, created by the Aspen Institute Communications and Society program and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, drilled into why trust is declining and how it can be rebuilt.

Same story—different chapter.[30:32] Childlike Wonder (25 minutes)Great men of the Bible like King Solomon had a childlike wonder about God and His creation, and God blessed them wonderfully for it! God will bless you too if you develop this same childlike wonder. | [00:30] Schiff Exposed (35 minutes)It was revealed yesterday that the chairman of the Congressional Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, communicated with the infamous whistleblower before the whistleblower filed his complaint! Why is this significant? The president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., summed it up perfectly on Twitter: “Adam Schiff submitted a subpoena for the very document that he helped create, and stood in front of the American people and claimed he had no knowledge of this whistleblower.” President Trump is right in calling this latest impeachment bid a total scam. In this segment, we go through the timeline of this latest hoax and explain how, once again, the president has managed to expose a great evil.  [37:15] Trump’s Stand (18 minutes) The Democrats and mainstream media have waged an all-out war, short of physical violence for now, against Donald Trump since he was elected into office. Bible prophecy indicates why President Trump has been able to withstand these attacks and what the future holds for his presidency.  | Listen to the Trumpet Daily radio program that aired on October 2, 2019.Visit: www.thetrumpet.com/stephen-flurry[01:57] Creeping Authoritarianism (7 minutes)This week, Communist China celebrates its 70th anniversary.

As the Bible prophesies, the division and corruption in the leadership will thrust both America and Britain into civil war, and their cities will burn with fire.[35:47] Doing God’s Word (17 minutes)It is entirely possible to worship God in vain—to hear the word and do nothing. God says that we must be more than hearers only or else we are deceiving ourselves. We must be doers of God’s Word! | Watching for Europe’s Response to Iran’s PushLast week, Europe’s leading nations released a joint statement condemning Iran directly for the September 14 attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure. The statement also called for a renegotiation to the nuclear deal that would include countering Iran’s terrorist activities. This stiffening of Europe’s response is a critical signpost in Bible prophecy.Ancient Tablets Give Clue Why Most Christians Do Not Keep the Feast of TrumpetsLast week, tablets found at an excavation in the center of Israel show how Babylonians were transplanted to the Holy Land 2,700 years ago.

Regardless, the media continues to fiercely condemn President Trump for “threats” in the transcript that are not, in fact, there.[13:11] Constitutional Vandalism (26 minutes)Britain’s Supreme Court has placed itself above the Queen as the highest authority in the land—above even the constitution. Despite the will of the people, Parliament is doing everything to keep Britain in the European Union. Why do Britain and America have the same pattern of lawlessness, lies and hypocrisy?[38:48] Hope Amid the Chaos (17 minutes)There is chaos in America and Britain, but there is also much hope amid the chaos.

Contrary to what the media would have you believe, her popularity and influence in the world is no accident, but rather a well-planned hoax by the radical left. [22:03] Another Anonymous Source (10 minutes) Another anonymous source has come forward to suggest that President Trump froze financial aid to Ukraine before calling its president. Following this, Democrats are now calling for impeachment proceedings. [32:28] Overruling the Queen (8 minutes) Today the British Supreme Court overruled the Queen Elizabeth's decision to prorogue parliament, marking a significant change in Britain’s constitution.
