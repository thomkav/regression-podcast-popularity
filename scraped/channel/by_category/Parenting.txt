Actually sometimes it’s leaving them on the sidewalk so you can catch the other one as they run into traffic (before you judge, just listen, and you'll understand). Listen as we celebrate the magical, messy, most difficult joys of parenting and question the rose colored filter on the curated Instagram accounts of motherhood. If you are (or have, or will be) raising small children, special needs children, or you love someone who does, this episode is for you. We call B.S. on the perfectly curated portrayal of life and family.\xa0 In this episode we’ll explore:  The pressure and guilt that comes with comparison The need to grieve and celebrate at different parts of parenting The power of being seen and heard on this journey How we can learn to stand in our truth so others are empowered to do the same.\xa0  “I think what’s being skipped with the celebration is the grief behind these perfect images.”\xa0-Sinead Quinn Resources and Links Mentioned in this episode:\xa0 The Official Podcast Instagram Sinead’s Instagram Brittany’s Instagram \xa0 | Loving yourself and your body can be difficult. Today we are sharing a few things hitting close to home with our review of a new app launch that is geared towards children's weight loss (spoiler: we don't love it), as well as a few of our own struggles in empowering ourselves and our children through healthy habits. If you have ever struggled with body image or communicating with your children around self love, this episode is for you. We call B.S. on childhood dieting.\xa0 In this episode we’ll explore:  The challenge of not conforming to one particular body type or ideal weight The impact of messages we receive about our bodies in early childhood The effects of labeling foods “good” or “bad” What it means to “lead by example” in projecting positive body image  “I remember that was the very first time that I was looking at someone in the mirror that didn’t add up to the image I had in my head.”\xa0 -Brittany Bollard Resources and Links Mentioned in this episode:\xa0 The Official Podcast Instagram Sinead’s Instagram Brittany’s Instagram \xa0 | Meet Sinead Quinn. In addition to being a mom and wife, she is a health coach for special needs moms\xa0 She has three amazing kids (ages 11, 9, and 7) and her oldest child has Down Syndrome and severe Speech Apraxia. Being a special needs mom has impacted and inspired her work in phenomenal ways. She and her family moved from Australia to America 4.5 years ago and recently moved from The Bay Area CA to the Seattle area WA. Sinead’s biggest passion is health & wellness coaching and speaking at events to advocate and encourage the mind and body health and wellness of special needs moms.\xa0 Meet Brittany Bollard. Brittany is a mom, wife, and wellness enthusiast. Her kids are now 7,5, and 2 years old. She loves them to the moon and back but she would venture to say this has been an especially hard season of parenting and is grateful for anyone willing to share the road with her. Brittany was inspired to become an empowerment coach through taking her own journey from a very dark place and moving into an empowered state where she could take control of her health and happiness. She lives by “if you aren’t changing it- you’re choosing it,” and she loves celebrating the wins no matter how small.\xa0 These two firecrackers met at a health retreat after Brittany took note of Sinead’s high top sneakers and crystal necklace. When Sinead spilled her heart for advocating for special needs moms, Brittany demanded that Sinead start a podcast to shed light on this very important and underrepresented subject. As their friendship continued, Sinead was able to help Brittany work through a hard season and new auto-immune disease diagnosis. The health coaching sessions honestly felt like a podcast, so they just decided to go in on it together and invite you into their conversation, tears, and laughter. Prepare to engage in some subjects that make you squirm but also bring relief as they bring normalcy to a ton of shame-filled subjects around what it means to be a woman in today’s world.\xa0 Resources and Links Mentioned in this episode:\xa0 The Official Podcast Instagram Sinead’s Instagram Brittany’s Instagram", 'chan_desc': 'Join us as we challenge common misconceptions, stereotypes, and assumptions about what it means to be a woman in today’s world.

In fact, how could she? She’s afraid of her own shadow! I am right there with you. But our young, anxious kids often turn into depressed, overwhelmed teens. The last thing we want is for them to self medicate. That’s why talking about drugs when they are young is so important.There comes a time when our kids think we “don’t get it.” Our kids lean on their peers for support. They think only other 16-year-olds get their pain (as scary as that might sound).We don’t want to wait until our window of opportunity is gone! That is why I am having some hard conversations with my anxious seven and nine-year-old. Their ears are open. They have lots of questions. I am pouring information that they are filing away for a later stage of life. Kids are wide open to talk about drugs at this age, but many of us worry about doing it.This week I invited the hysterical Tiffany Jenkins from Juggling the Jenkins, to the AT Parenting Podcast. She came on my radar after many parents in my audience kept sharing her hysterical videos on Facebook and Youtube. As I dived deeper into her work, I discovered a more serious side to Tiffany. She is a recovering drug addict. She has used her fame and platform to educate others on the dangers of drugs. In her memoir, High Achiever to shares the inner workings of a person struggling to beat an addiction and all the turmoil it brings with it.In the podcast she shares her raw and real truth and with it gives parents a chance to make a difference in their children’s lives. Check out Tiffany’s Youtube channel, her Facebook page, her podcast, Take it or Leave it and her book, High Achiever.

In this show, we're discussing Skill #1 RESPONDS AND INTERACTS WITH THINGS IN THE ENVIRONMENT. Remember that this skill refers to a child's ability to react to sensory information - or things he can see, hear, touch, hold, and manipulate. The kinds of skills we want to facilitate at this phase are alerting, looking, calming, attending, reaching, grasping, holding, mouthing, waving objects, banging, and then...\xa0REPEAT!\xa0 Here's where we should begin to work with toddlers with severe developmental disabilities and not on teaching them to talk.\xa0Why? Because a child who can't do these kinds of things consistently, chiefly alert, react, and interact with things in his or her environment, is not developmentally ready to learn to understand and use words. In this show, I discussed specific activities, ideas, and toys to help improve this area. Remember that this information is best suited for speech therapy for toddlers with severe delays and any young child with a significant developmental disability. As a general guide, this would include children who functioning in the birth to 6 month developmental range. Learning that occurs in this phase happens through exploration with repeated exposure during sensory-enriched experiences. That's a mouthful to say and hard for many parents to understand, so here's how I break it down for the families I see. Our main goal for children who need help to master this first skill is to provide activities to help a child learn to use his senses to explore things in his or her little world. Ideas I recommend for this skill are listed in the post for show #386 at teachmetotalk.com.Therapists... get 1 hour CE credit for this course for only $5!

And unfortunately, when we respond from a place of our own Yuck, we do things we regret -- AND we lose our influence over our kids. That’s why, if we want to raise more responsible, resilient kids, we need to learn how to NOT be controlled by our own feelings. It is possible with this step-by-step, long-game strategy for not letting our feelings lead us to behave in ways that we regret. | Hearing the word “no” from our child when we ask them to do something -- or any other type of defiance or disrespect -- can send us into a rage! Unfortunately when we lose our cool, we also tend to lose our influence over our kids. It is possible to stay in control of ourselves even when our kids are being disrespectful so that we can address their behavior more effectively. Learn the step-by-step, long-game strategy for not letting your kids’ reactions control yours. | In many cases, our kids don’t listen or do what they’re supposed to do until the third or fourth time we ask… or until we yell or threaten to take away something they care about.

We’ll discuss the 3 reasons that kids misbehave in the first place (you have to understand these if you want this to change!), and then we’ll discuss the Parenting Long Game model and how it addresses all 3 of those reasons. You’ll also see what this looks like using an example of a mom who’s frustrated because her kids don’t do what she asks them to do.\xa0 | You have likely tried many different strategies to reduce the power struggles, meltdowns, negotiations, and negative attitudes in your home… but even if those strategies work in the short run,\xa0 you’re not seeing long-term results. Learn WHY the tools you’ve been using rely on what I call “Band-Aid Parenting” -- and why band-aid parenting only leads to short term results. I’ll also discuss the framework for “Long Game Parenting,” which relies on long-term solutions for improving behavior, attitudes, in moods of everyone in the family! The best news is that Long-Game Parenting doesn’t take longer… the results just last longer. | Learn about Rachel Bailey\'s background, as well as what the "Parenting Long Game" is and how it can help YOU feel more confident (and less depleted) as a parent.

After a long day of sitting quietly, following directions, trying to focus, and being otherwise un-childlike, our kids are expected to come home, sit down, and do more of the same. Yuck! Additionally, many put pressure on themselves to perform and show up perfectly, so just the act of studying or being assessed is stressful. In this listener-requested episode, Ed and Renee take on homework by sharing tools for finding motivation and discovering the "why" of homework.\xa0Support the show | We loving getting your letters and messages, and we\'ve dedicated this entire episode to reading and responding to our favorites. There are letters from parents with struggling children, encouraging success stories from listeners who are making positive changes, and new strategies and interventions for dealing with the mental wellness challenges we face every day.\xa0Support the show | Even if you\'re a person who experiences worry, even if you\'re all too familiar with the mental turmoil and physical pain of anxiety, most of us don\'t know how to help others who are dealing with similar challenges. Even worse, we find that anxiety in others starts to cause anxiety in ourselves. In this episode, Ed and Renee walk us through ways to calm and comfort our anxious family members and friends without escalating their experience or trying to match their emotions ourselves.\xa0Support the show | Maybe it\'s that time of year, when your kids are heading back to school, or maybe going for the first time. Maybe it\'s a first stay with a babysitter. Maybe it\'s a first sleepover. Whatever the case, it can be hard for a child to leave a parent. And really, just as hard for a parent to leave a child. At some point, we all experience some anxiety over being apart. It\'s a normal, biological response to separation from a protector or dependent. But we all need to endure those separations, and Ed and Renee are here with some tools for doing just that.\xa0Support the show | All the answers to your mental wellness challenges are right here in this very episode! Included is a simple set of instructions that will change your life: "You just have to look at the bright side and think more positively." Ugh, if only anything was that simple. In this episode, Ed and Renee talk through the complexities of three different types of mindsets: optimistic mindset, growth mindset, and stress mindset. You\'ll learn how they affect our behavior, and how they affect what happens inside our bodies.\xa0Support the show | At some point in time, everyone feels the pain of not fitting in. It hurts to feel like there is nobody else around who is just like us. But really, why shouldn\'t we be unique? Why shouldn\'t we be one of a kind? Why shouldn\'t we embrace our superpower of being original? In this episode, Renee explains what it means to be original, to listen to your inner voice, and follow your heart, but it all begins with some emotional storytelling and confessions by Ed.\xa0Support the show | This week, we\'re happy share Renee\'s interview with Dr. Justin Coulson. Dr. Coulson is a respected and popular parenting expert, and is sought after for his advice on family life, relationships, well-being, and resilience.\xa0Support the show | Are you not sure what post-traumatic growth means? That\'s okay, Ed doesn\'t know either. But, as he\'s fond of saying, thank goodness Renee is here. She describes the importance of finding value after challenging experiences, explains the contrast to post-traumatic stress, and together, Ed and Renee demonstrate some of the skills involved in helping kids find the positive hidden in the negative, while balancing the importance of allowing them space to feel their hurt.Support the show | Have you been searching for the meaning of life? Relax, you\'ve finally found it! Well, you\'ve found a podcast about meaning, at least. There are a lot of myths about meaning in life. Is it tied to work? Family? Helping others? Or is it something else entirely? Believe it or not, there have been studies done about what gives life the most meaning, and Ed and Renee are here to share some of that information, give you some tips for helping your kids find meaning, and maybe they\'ll help you find some yourself.\xa0Support the show | Most of us know people who always believe, no matter the circumstances, that things will turn out just peachy! At the same time, we know people who breath constant doom and gloom and believe that the decks are always stacked against success. Of course, the truth usually lies somewhere between. Join Ed and Renee as they demonstrate tools for finding the balance between both extremes, and teach us all how to be realistic optimists.\xa0Support the show', 'chan_desc': 'Worry, anger, stress, perfectionism, body image: if you feel it, we want to talk about it.

We tackle everything from getting to school on time, to mastering the school lunch, to transitioning into the late afternoon without backpacks and shoes all over the floor, as well as techniques for soothing that “after-school” attitude. I even toss in a listener question: How a mother can find more patience with her three year-old now that she’s exhausted from a newborn? Cause honestly, who doesn\'t hope for a little more patience during major transitions.And then I have a parent-teacher meeting with Jennifer Hunt, a second generation early childhood educator. “The best preschool teacher in the world” according to my daughter Sabrina shares with me how the heck she gets all those little kids to actually listen, what advice she has for concerned parents of “the new kid”, what it’s like having her own toddler start preschool, and how you might approach a teacher to be your ally if you’re having behavioral issues at home.

[16:35] How can we not only accept who they are today, but also who our children will become?\xa0 [18:21] What are some of those things you think you wouldn’t be able to accept or tolerate?\xa0 [19:49] Not accepting our children may result in losing our relationship with them. [23:38] Not accepting our children may cause them to lose relationship with themselves.\xa0 [25:32] Let’s not let our own agenda for our children overpower our unconditional love for them. [27:12] Tolerance isn’t enough. We must accept, love, and celebrate who they are (and who they’re becoming).\xa0 [29:30] The byproduct of this level of acceptance will be more influence.\xa0  \xa0If you enjoyed this episode and it inspired you in some way, I’d love to hear about it and know your biggest takeaway.

Resource  Show notes: www.theparentingjunkie.com/37  \xa0 | In this episode we’re going to talk about religious practices, faith, and religious communities. People often ask me about how they can combine their passion and commitment to parenting from a loving and respectful place with their commitment to their faith (which might be based on a type of rewards system itself!) It’s a tough but important question to answer. And this doesn’t apply to just organized religion; it’s applicable to any sort of belief system or way of life (like veganism, atheism, or any of the other “isms”).\xa0 \xa0 [4:08] How do we get our children to adopt our belief system without controlling or manipulating?\xa0 [6:20] Dr. Shefali shares her thoughts on religion and parenting. [11:44] Those raised in a religious home often feel obligated to “carry the torch”.\xa0 [15:15] Any religion, belief, or way of life can come from a place of love or fear.\xa0 [16:59] Trying to force others into our beliefs is a sign of insecurity.\xa0 [18:09] Others raised in a religious home completely abandon their faith as they come of age. [19:25] It doesn’t have to be “all-or-nothing”. We can throw out what doesn’t serve us and keep what does. [23:06] Use critical thinking and discernment. [24:34] Check our motives; are we doing (or not doing) something because we’re afraid of what others might think or say?\xa0 [26:22] Do our beliefs make us separatists? [27:41] Is there duality in our beliefs?\xa0 [29:41] We should share our beliefs with our children and give them space to explore and make their own interpretations.\xa0 [30:15] Instead of forcing, controlling, or manipulating religious activity, let’s inspire it. [33:20] Try to create positive interactions. Make the positive to negative ratio 5:1. \xa0 Links & Resources   Gottman Institute article\xa0  | In this episode we’ll discuss spirituality in parenting, regardless of one’s religion. \xa0  [6:50] Are religious people happier? [8:29] Organized religions often facilitate social ties and community. [10:15] Religious people create time to pursue spiritual feelings and emotions. [13:25] We can harness these same feelings and emotions in our parenting. [14:58] If you’re curious about my personal spirituality… [17:50] Parenting itself is an act of spirituality. [18:21] Gratitude [21:13] Giving [24:45] Create a gateway to your emotions and spirituality and make it part of your day-to-day life.  \xa0 Links & Resources  Show Notes Quote from Brené\xa0Brown at 4:50: “Spirituality is recognizing and celebrating that we are all inextricably connected to each other by a power greater than all of us, and that our connection to that power and to one another is grounded in love and compassion. Practicing spirituality brings a sense of perspective, meaning, and purpose to our lives.” This definition was first published in The Gifts of Imperfection. For some people, that power greater than us is God; for others, it’s fishing. Some are reminded of our inextricable connection by faith; others by expressions of shared humanity. Some find that religion is the best expression of inextricable human connection that is guided by love and compassion, and others believe that no entity has done more to corrode that connection than organized religion.”  | Leadership and Family. How about Leadership and Parenting? Do these words go together?\xa0 When you became a parent maybe you began to feel more like a servant than a leader. Maybe you feel like you just need to keep people alive and happy, get them what they need, and be there for them.\xa0 Leadership is an act of service, but it's very different than being a servant.\xa0 When we're servants we don't have a vision, but when we're leaders this is at the very crux of good leadership.\xa0 A clear vision. In this episode we’re going to talk about leadership and how we can be effective leaders for our families. A lot of us were thrown into this parenting role without developing our skills as a leader.  [3:46] Most of us default to what was modeled for us in our own childhood. Perhaps your own parents were permissive (weak leaders) or authoritarian (overbearing leaders). [7:08] Sometimes parenthood feels more like being a servant than a leader. [9:23] We should look to influential leaders for inspiration in our parenting. \xa0 [11:30] We are of service to our children, but not servants to them. [15:12] What would it look like if we stepped into the role of being the visionary for our family? [17:53] Bad bosses can teach us what NOT to do. [21:06] Great bosses can show us what it looks like to successfully lead a group of individuals. [23:36] We have an obligation to create a vision for our family…and it doesn’t happen through control. [26:59] Children need leaders. [28:01] Leaders keep themselves together. They don’t melt down on those they lead. [30:06] We have to be willing to make hard choices, often with imperfect information, and deal with the conflict or consequences.  \xa0 Links & Resources  Show notes for this podcast Related Podcast:\xa0 “I am the curriculum” \xa0  | The word authority gets a bad rap when it comes to peaceful parenting because it tends to get lumped in with the authoritarian parenting style which is the “do as I say or else” style. But authority is actually well rooted in the authoritative style where you have high expectations but you also provide high support and warmth.\xa0 \xa0 When we choose to abdicate our role as the authority, our children are then left to make decisions they are not ready to make. Instead, if we become that empathetic firm leader, our children can relax because they know there's someone at the helm. \xa0 We need to get comfortable being the authority figure. As Janet Lansbury said “Children NEED parents. They feel no real freedom without boundaries. They are not little adults with the maturity to make healthy, thoughtful, sensible decisions about screen use, sugar intake, etc.” I couldn’t agree more.\xa0 \xa0 In this episode, I’ll share why being the authority figure in your family actually liberates your children and 3 ways to get comfortable being the authority figure...here’s what you’ll hear: \xa0 [6:19] It’s our JOB! [7:30] Authoritative vs. Authoritarian [11:06] Legal and moral responsibility [12:47] Social and physical responsibility [15:50] Is authority harsh? [16:41] Don’t throw your kids in the deep end 🏊\u200d♀️ [18:47] Downside of democracy (in the home) [22:23] Janet Lansbury’s take on parenting by democracy [25:42] Eventually you will have no more authority… [26:44] #1 - Give small choices [30:44] #2 - Get comfortable [33:02] #3 - Why it’s an act of generosity \xa0 \xa0 Remember, when children have a leader and have clarity around the expectations of the home they are liberated and free to enjoy the ride. \xa0 If you enjoyed this episode and it inspired you in some way, I’d love to hear about it and know your biggest takeaway.

Like you’re failing as a parent and just not measuring up?\xa0 \xa0 You’ve heard it before, “comparison is the thief of joy.” But, in this information at our fingertips world we are living in, it can be difficult to not fall into the trap of comparing.\xa0 \xa0 We can also get discouraged even when we don’t compare ourselves to others but to some ideal version of ourselves that we constantly fail to be.\xa0 It can feel like a mountain towering over you with SO many areas to work on, and no one is immune (myself included).\xa0 \xa0 In this episode, I’ll share the cause of this distress and 3 things to help you overcome it...here’s what you’ll hear: \xa0 [4:22] Information overload 📚 [7:43] Check your expectations [10:30] Breathe with me (bookmark this for later if you’re driving or want to keep coming back for more! 🧘\u200d♀️) [12:38] #1 - What to do if you MUST Compare [15:50] #2 - What we can learn from Warren Buffett [19:49] #3 - 🎶Celebrate good times, come on! 🎶 \xa0 You can do this, you ARE doing this, treat yourself with compassion and celebrate your wins! \xa0 If you enjoyed this episode and it inspired you in some way, I’d love to hear about it and know your biggest takeaway.

Her baby is just turning one and she told me: “I’ve really let myself go”... she described how she hasn’t been to the gym since her pregnancy, how she’s enslaved herself in service of her baby and how she hasn’t been out with her girlfriends in months. \xa0 If this is you, I’m going to share a mindset shift that will help you break free of victimhood and enslavement parenting - and how your child will benefit greatly from this shift as well. \xa0 You’ve heard it before, you’ve probably even said it - my children are my WHOLE world, my kids are my life. I know I have. It’s true that when we become a parent our children take a place in our lives that’s greater than anything that has come before them. We would literally lay down our life for our children.\xa0 \xa0 While we would sacrifice our lives to save our children should we also sacrifice our life, well-being, and happiness just to care for them?\xa0 And if we do so what are we actually modeling for our children? What type of parents will they grow up to be when we choose this path?  Parenting like this can lead to burnout. Maybe it’s time we also focus not just on parenting the whole child but on being the WHOLE parent...here’s what you’ll hear: \xa0 [4:29] What is a whole life? [6:37] Tying our worth to our sacrifice [9:08] More sacrifice, more work = better parent? (spoiler alert: NO, it doesn’t) [11:12] This does NOT mean become a narcissist [14:10] You make me… [16:46] The solution! Yes please! [18:14] Nourish yourself 🧘\u200d♀️ [19:51] Drop “or” - use “and” instead! [20:55] You are MORE than just a parent \xa0 Remember, you are the curriculum. How you show up, including most of all, how you treat yourself, is what your child will learn. Are you treating yourself the way you hope they grow up to treat themselves? \xa0 If you enjoyed this episode and it inspired you in some way, I’d love to hear about it and know your biggest takeaway.

Or perhaps you’re not a working parent but you are trying to meet your needs and desires in some way be it fitness, or a hobby and also feel guilty when trying to balance the two? \xa0 If you’ve ever felt like you’re a failure on all fronts this episode is for you! \xa0 This episode will mainly focus on balancing the needs from a work perspective but you can apply it to any faucet of your life. When we try to show up as different versions of ourselves and hide the parts of ourselves we don’t feel belong under that hat we can be left feeling fragmented, like we are a failure in both areas of our lives. \xa0 You’ll learn how to change your language to change your mind (spoiler alert: realize you have ONE life). Also, you’ll realize that it is ok and even expected if your experience in one role affects your experience in the other because after all, you are one integrated person.\xa0 \xa0  In this episode we’ll discuss “work-life balance.” Is it an illusion to think that you can truly balance your work life and home life, especially in modern times when there is less separation between the 2? Here’s what you’ll hear:\xa0 \xa0 [5:01] Conform to Society’s Desire? [6:58] Bring home the bacon AND spend more time with your kids [10:39] It’s all in how you frame it [13:11] Drop “or” choose “and” instead! [14:26] You don’t have to hide your “momness” at work [17:17] You don’t have to hide your professional self at home [18:41] Forget work-life, you have ONE life [20:59] Working IS good parenting - drop the guilt! [24:03] What are you teaching your children? (You don’t wanna miss this!) [28:37] Resent the “2nd shift”? If so this is the reframe that will change your life! \xa0 So is work-life balance achievable? Yes, of course. But only when you stop treating them as separate things and treat them as faucets of the one integrated life you have.\xa0 \xa0 If you enjoyed this episode and it inspired you in some way, I’d love to hear about it and know your biggest takeaway.

Join our (free & awesome) FB community  Love Parenting with Avital. \xa0 Show Notes: https://www.theparentingjunkie.com/30 | We’re faced with many decisions in this parenting journey, and many options seem to be extreme on one side or the other. \xa0 Should you be a whole life unschooler, or punish your children when they don’t get straight As in school? \xa0 Should you work outside the home and climb the corporate ladder or should you surrender to a life of staying at home, giving up on your interests and income in favor of parenting? \xa0 Should you give them free access to screens or should you be completely screen free? \xa0 Not only does it feel polarizing but it also can make us feel like we don’t really fit in anywhere if we aren’t on either end of the extreme.\xa0 \xa0 I’m going to offer up an alternative - the radical middle. I won’t say it will be easy. Let’s face it, when you make the decision to stay curious and not sit on either end of the extreme it can be hard. You’re choosing to create a path instead of following one that’s already laid down. Being in the middle means we think about all the decisions and what works for us right now and we stay open to learn more and change our minds if a different decision would better meet our families needs. \xa0  In this episode we’ll discuss how you don’t have to choose one extreme over another, and that most of us fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. Here’s what you’ll hear:\xa0 \xa0 [5:03] Decision fatigue is real\xa0 [8:36] How to combat decision fatigue [9:53] Example 1: Discipline [13:27] Example 2: Sleep training [17:11] Example 3: Education [19:18] Example 4: Boundaries [23:00] What is my identity in parenting? [24:02] The radical middle. [25:50] Pick what’s best and leave the rest. [29:19] The middle is hard [32:44] The middle is brave\xa0 [34:44] The middle is radical. \xa0 The middle can be messy. It’s not always neat and clear because there is no one size fits all.\xa0 At the end of the day the answer is always “it depends.”\xa0 \xa0 If you enjoyed this episode and it inspired you in some way, I’d love to hear about it and know your biggest takeaway.

Don\'t despair. Today\'s guest, Dan Weissmann, has some great ideas and advice!  Dan sparked a movement when he began a podcast about the many ways average Americans - confronting a healthcare system that can be ruinous both financially, and healthwise - think of and approach family health and happiness. The Arm and a Leg Podcast dives into some crazy stuff!

It all starts in early childhood. Today we dive into how young children learn best. Plus in Parenting News: As parents, we can\'t be all serious and big-business. Without some downtime, we can\'t keep going, in child-rearing, in outside-of-the-home jobs, or within ourselves.

In part because of this experience, she went on to become a therapist, a woman who has dedicated her life to helping others through their toughest moments. "My true passion is to help children to thrive," she writes. Today we discuss many ways to help your child to do exactly that. I know you will get a lot out of this conversation. Many thanks to Anna Seewald for coming on We Turned Out Okay! Plus in Parenting News: Back in July I got to be a guest on Anna\'s show! Extending on this theme about how childhood experiences shape us, I share that I was sexually assaulted at age 7.

I talk about my biggest fear when becoming a mother, and Laura and I explain why motherhood sometimes feels like living with a gun to your head, and also what changes inside us as the toddlers grow into teenagers (it’s actually positive). Laura tells us what it was like to write such a personal and taboo book – and what people’s reactions have been, what she misses most about the younger ages, and how she feels when her daughter says she doesn’t ever want to have kids. I share about when I feel most happy while mothering, what helped me decide if I should have a second baby or not (which still gets me emotional, shocker), and I lay out my theory about how different types of moms have different stages of intense struggle. I’m curious if you’ll agree. | Join me and my wise and hilarious friend, Jennifer, for a conversation with lots of laughing, swearing, self-deprecation, and truly life-changing concepts, as we talk about alcohol and parenting, specifically her path as an alcoholic mother. Even if you don’t personally have an issue with alcohol, nor does anyone in your inner circle, this episode has so many gems about parenting and making mistakes – basically, being a human. We talk about how our mothering instincts can and cannot thwart alcoholism, what was actually behind her addiction (hint: it wasn’t actually the alcohol), the simplest question that turned her life around, and the hard-earned gifts that alcoholism gave her and her kids (yes, you heard that right, alcoholism can bestow gifts, if you don’t let it kill you first). She also details some warning signs for alcoholism, and ways to tell if you or someone you love is more than just a causal drinker. She’s maaaaaybe the most vulnerable guest I’ve had yet, and maybe the most inspirational without trying to be. \xa0If you are someone who drinks a little too much (or you’re married to someone who does) and you’re feeling like, “Yeah, I don’t know if I can listen to this,” because you’re scared of what you might learn about yourself or your partner, PLEASE JUST LISTEN. You’ll see why. | Today’s episode is in response to my first two podcast episodes. A few of my lesbian and queer listeners were like, “What the shit is this hetero life and marriage you talk about??” Their shock and disdain made me want to know more about same-sex marriages, and how much of our hetero marriage and parenting issues are gender-based. Today’s guest, a lesbian mom, so graciously lets me dig into her private life to seek the answers to my burning questions. It turns out that I had a lot of varying fantasies about what being in a relationship with another woman was really like. We talk about gender, sex, social conditioning, division of household labor, periods, working mom struggles, identity, and other relatable mom shit, including my really important opinion on pumpkin patches. | Some of you need today’s episode. Some of you may think it’s a little extreme. If so, it will give you a look into an experience that many other moms are having, that luckily you didn’t. So either way there is something to be learned, or a new perspective to be gained. My guest, Marissa, a licensed marriage and family therapist, talks about broadening the postpartum depression diagnosis, and even abandoning it in some cases. She talks candidly about her own transition into motherhood as a therapist and mother, and how it forced her to rethink everything, including coining a controversial new term that she thinks will help struggling new moms to avoid depression. We talk about anxiety, taboos, mom guilt, postpartum myths few mothers say out loud, experimenting with out-of-the-box norms in our home, and we debate our differing viewpoints on self-care. Also, I may or may not sing the world’s most annoying Gymboree song. | Today’s guest, Deidre, is so unbelievably gracious, even though she didn't have to be. Deidre agreed to answer my questions and educate us all. I wanted to know things like: How are we white women getting it wrong? What do black mothers experience that white mothers have no idea about? And, what do you wish we’d do to help you? What she delivers is more vulnerable and enlightening than I even imagined. We also talk about why the “I don’t see color” thing is problematic – for all races, the friendship I lost over sticking up for murdered black people, and the fear we white women have about saying something that’s not “woke” (which is not good for anyone). Don’t worry, we laugh a lot today too, as usual, and I realize how to take some of the overwhelm out of fighting racism. And this is just the start of a larger conversation around race. A drop in the bucket. There are so many layers to this topic, ones I’m not even aware of. So by no means is this a tidy discussion with easy answers, and it’s not done perfectly. It’s just two friends: a white mom and a black mom talking candidly about a hard topic, both with the best intentions. | Author, Darcy Lockman, discusses how even egalitarian couples fall into mini patriarchies after kids. You'll be surprised at all that's at play. | A quick, practical meditation for frazzled moms to do anytime, anywhere, with lots of LOLs. We cover the non-annoying whys and hows of meditation, including its importance with setting boundaries with our kids. | Someone in the motherhood business (who isn’t a mother herself) drops wisdom about why millennials aren’t having kids, what she thinks is the hardest part of the Mom job, magic she sees that parents can’t, and much more. | Nod your head along as four hilarious and honest moms admit their favorite and least favorite parts of being mothers – some taboo. Recorded from a writer’s retreat. | How to store (or not store) kid art and baby clothes, why clutter is visual anxiety and why women feel this weight, we break down Marie Kondo's merits and neuroses, and more.", 'chan_desc': 'Based off her popular and darkly humorous Facebook page, blog and forthcoming novel of the same name, author Brandy Ferner takes her love of adult conversation to the air as she spears the injustices of modern parenting and continues her tradition of saying things out loud that others won’t. As a lover of truth and all things dark comedy, she and special guests partake in real talk about everything relating to motherhood – marriage post kids, birth, the never-ending micromanagement of screen time, sex, chronic-illness, Snoop Dogg, social issues, homeschooling, meditation, the revolt of the aging uterus, postpartum depletion, writing, the joke that is half-day kindergarten, and more. This is not a podcast with annoying parenting advice.

In Montessori, we know that the type of play also makes a big difference. Therefore, it makes perfect sense for modern parennts to be a little particular about which toys serve to help nurture the whole child, and which don’t measure up.  But this episode isn’t about what toys are best for children!  Nope….we’re troubleshooting what to do with all the toys that you receive from loving friends and relatives (for example, your child’s grandparents).  Some of those toys you may authentically appreciate and want to keep.  Others may conflict with the educational experience you are doing your best to provide to your child at home.  As parents, we not only serve the children in our home but all of the people who orbit them and lavish love upon them. We want to handle this sensitive issue with grace and courtesy, kindness and and consideration. But how?  In this episode, I read a letter from a mama who acknowledges that her mother-in-law’s “love language” is gift-giving, and the toys are not exactly the kind she would have chosen for her child.  Dive in as I offer some tips for managing the unwanted toy overload while maintaining gratitude as the center of the grandparent-parent-child relationship.  The Montessori Magic for today is an exploration into the sound cylinders, a sensorial activity. And remember: just like tea, your parenting efforts need time to brew.  Love, Aubrey  P.S. You can find everything you need related to this podcast, including show notes  RIGHT HERE.\xa0 | The development of perseverance as a life-long skill starts when children are very, very little. By offering opportunities for independence and assistance only when necessary, we guide our children along this path.  Child development, however, is never a linear process. Sometimes our children go through phases where they are begging for our assistance when we know that they are perfectly capable of doing the activity themselves.  What is a Montessori parent to do when there are multiple cries of “Mommy do it!” or “But I can’t….”?  In this episode, I read a letter from a mama who is worried that her previous use of praise, such as “Good job” and interrupting her child too often during work has led her child into feelings of incompetence.  Dive in as I offer some insight on typical child behavior at different stages of life and tips for effective parenting.  The Montessori Magic for today is an exploration into the classic dressing frames, a practical life activity.  Come join me as we find the calm and help our children learn and grow.  Love, Aubrey  P.S. You can find everything you need related to this podcast RIGHT HERE.\xa0 | We expect our babies to cry, but when our toddlers or older children learn how to talk, we assume those days are over.  Not so, dear parent.  In fact, while it feels completely unreasonable and frustrating to you, your child might be crying for a variety of reasons that are completely valid for someone so young.  In this episode, I read a letter from a mama whose 3 year old seems to cry all the time! The morning routine is especially stressful and includes tantrums and whiny crying.  She’s tried everything she can think of to get him to stop crying, but he continues to be upset over every little thing and now…she’s worried. Is this normal behavior? Should she consult a pediatrician?  Dive in as I offer some real-deal gentle, compassionate parenting strategies that help children with those big emotions, especially when they are sensitive little beings by nature.  The Montessori Magic for today is a debate: real dough vs. playdough! Which one will win?  Come join me as we find the calm and help our children learn and grow.  Love, Aubrey  P.S.

There is no need to make things complicated. In fact, the more complicated and rigid your lesson, the more likely your toddler is to run away, shout "No!", make a huge mess, or to just outright do the opposite of what you had intended for her to do!\xa0  When working with little toddlers, it pays to understand their developmental stage.  In this episode, I read a letter from a frustrated and bewildered mama and offer some parenting tips to help you gain a more realistic expectation of the abilities of these indepependent, capable, and incredibly different little beings.  The Montessori Magic I bring you today comes from Maria herself, a reading from The Absorbent Mind. She has such a sweet story to share about a walking toddler!  Love,\xa0 Aubrey  P.S. You can find everything related to this episode RIGHT HERE. | When your child asks for a hug after behaving badly, you may feel like you are rewarding his negative attention-seeking behavior! No one wants that! But is it truly a reward? Or should you give in to the request for a cuddle?  This situation can cause many parents to feel conflicting emotions, just like this mama did in her letter to me.\xa0  We\'re going to take a little deep dive into the negative attention-seeking toddlers and preschoolers engage in all-too-often, and I\'ll give you some strategies for helping your child learn to communicate with you in more positive ways.  As always, I\'ll throw in some Montessori magic for good measure. The lesson this week is a secret recipe for enticing children toward water pouring work. All you need is a beet.\xa0  Love,\xa0 Aubrey  P.S.

You end up bickering over things that really don’t matter. It might even be hard to remember the days when you fell in love and hoped for a baby. Maybe you feel sick at heart and nostalgic for the old days.  Or maybe you just feel irritated at your partner’s attempts at intimacy while you’re trying to “do it all” as a mom of young children when there’s always a dirty diaper to change or a meal to make or a skinned knee begging for a band-aid.  There is no instant fix for saving a marriage, of course. Developing healthy relationships takes a lot of love, effort and consistency.  I’m going to share with you a letter from a mama who is struggling with adapting to a recent move with twin toddlers and a stressed-out partner. She asks me if taking up walks in nature as a family has a healing effect, a counter to the stress. YES, IT DOES. I’ll tell you why.  I’ll also throw in a bit of Montessori magic for good measure!

Neither did my husband David. Both of us came from teacher-centric families in support of the\xa0 public school system.\xa0  But then we had children, debated about whether to send them to preschool, and finally just jumped into homeschooling and haven\'t looked back.\xa0  Now, with two elementary aged boys, we\'re going full steam ahead year by year.\xa0  I want to introduce you to the love of my life and homeschool partner, my husband David.\xa0  This is our homeschool story.\xa0  Love,\xa0 Aubrey  P.S. You can find the show notes to this podcast RIGHT HERE.\xa0 | Some children seem to just be born with a bigger personality. You know the type. Often, they’ve got older, more reserved siblings.  This is the child who can tantrum the loudest, needs to be first in line, always wants to win every game, lies unapologetically, and walks into the middle of the room with such contagious enthusiasm you just can’t help but be captivated by her.  You just gotta love this spirited little diva with your whole heart, as exhausting as she is.  We’re going to dig deep into how to understand and soothe her competitive nature while admiring all that she is meant to be when she grows up.  Homeschooolers, stick around because today’s Montessori inspiration is the plant polishing work, a lesson you can do at home with your toddler or preschooler.  I know, I know, you’re thinking….”why would I want to polish a plant?” But trust me, you do!  Love, Aubrey  You can find the notes & resources mentioned in this podcast RIGHT HERE. | But whyyyyyy do they whine?! And what do we dooooooo?!  When children whine, it can make any reasonable parent feel irritated, and I promise you I have been there, done that, and learned lots. As we dive in to this topic, I want to share a letter with you from a loving, empathetic mama who could use a wee bit of help in this parenting department.  There really is a key to stopping the whining long term: take the time to interpret your child\'s behavior and then respond to it without encouraging more of it.  I\'ll go into what not to do and then give you several discipline strategies that are both gentle and effective.  The next time your child whines about something, you\'ll have a solid plan. I\'ll leave you with some inspiration to try out a sand tray with your child, a lesson you can do at home with your toddler or preschooler.  Come join me as we follow the child and find the calm.

So many women are told VBAC is not an option after just one Cesarean, let alone 3. As you listen to Shannon’s story, pay attention to how she tuned into her intuition, got educated, and was completely in control of her pregnancy and the 41 hour long induction at 41 weeks and 5 days. The induction came after her provider recommended a repeat Cesarean and told her she would only have a 10%-15% chance of success.

Let’s start with the tea we’re sipping on - Meka and Nique are both enjoying some Spearmint tea, which is supposed to be beneficial for your skin and good for your system (but please, get your medical advice from your physician!)\xa03:10 - Today’s tea topic choice from the Topic Jar is: mom wear! We’re always hoping that our listeners are slaying the day with their looks, but looking good takes effort. Our hosts are rocking their cute, comfy, podcasting outfits, complete with MomSlay shirts. Know why mom-slay is important? Because you never know where you’re going to end up, you don’t know who you’re going to meet, and you don’t know when opportunity is going to show up - and you don’t want to miss out because you weren’t dressed for it!\xa06:15 - A word on hygiene: wash your hands and get your kids to wash their hands! Good hygiene practices are healthy and common sense (think about everything you touch all day…).\xa06:50 - Nique has a story about pajamas. Even though it’s her rule to never wear them in public, she went to a Women Evolve pajama event, so she turned up in some silky PJs and Louboutins - pajama fancy. But, as she was leaving… her car got rear-ended. The one time that she broke her rule and wore pajamas out in public, she gets held up with a car accident!\xa0\xa09:40 - What’s another piece of great mom-wear advice? Fresh underwear. Every. Day. We say this for the same reason that Nique doesn’t wear pajamas in public - you never know what might happen and you don’t want underwear with holes in them. What about bras? Yes, those need to fit you and look at getting resized after kids. Victoria’s Secret will measure you and you don’t even need to buy anything!\xa0\xa011:48 - Meek’s go-to mom outfit right now are some leggings or mom-jeans, a mom-slay tee and tennis shoes because she has four kids, three of whom are little boys that don’t stop going, and she needs to always be ready to run after them! Nique enjoys getting dressed in the morning, changing from athleisure to dresses depending on the day - simple, easy, classy. Regardless of what you wear, we believe that if you look good, you feel good!\xa016:28 - Do you rock the throwback Juicy Couture look? Share your throwback looks and tag @teawithmeekandnique on instagram so we can see all your fabulous outfits.\xa018:55 - Nique talks about how her youngest daughter is exploring her own fashion and expression. We lead by example as fashionable moms, so it’s exciting to see what our kids come up with in styling themselves!\xa021:30 - What about mom-fashion swimwear? Both our hosts love a two-piece - they’re fashionable while being functional, and allows for more body positivity that comes with showing off the mom-bod!\xa023:35 - We always want to hear from our listeners! Tell us about your favorite mom-wear style or outfit, let us know what you rock and what makes you feel good.\xa024:45 - It’s time for Drive Tracks: what are we listening to on the road? Nique is enjoying Shine by Swoop and Meka is listening to Old Town Road (mainly for little Axel) by Lil Nas X. Every time Axel is having a tantrum, she plays Old Town Road for him and he just starts dancing! For herself though, she’s feeling I Love You Lord by Elevation Worship. It always helps with a bad day and makes Meek feel so positive.\xa0______________________\xa0Want some MomSlay shirts?

We’re introducing our new Jar of Questions to help us pick topics to discuss on the podcast.\xa01:00 - To start, let’s go over what tea has been steeping in our cups, so Meek and Nique let us know what they’ve been sippin’ on - literally and figuratively. We’re always open to listener suggestions for some new teas for our communi-TEA of moms to try!\xa02:45 - We’re going to talk about our week and life updates are happening. Meek starts with happy family visits, movie adventures, hosting a mini-reunion at her house, and getting through a slightly stressful weekend.\xa0\xa04:25 - This leads us to our topic for today: working through family relationships! Meek has a huge family with cousins playing with cousins, holidays at Big Mama’s house, while Nique has a smaller family.\xa0\xa08:31 - Meek gets into the family drama and how Facebook can really fuel some uncomfortable family moments. After talking it out, things seemed to be okay… until the Facebook posts started to come out after the weekend. Getting rid of toxic relationships is needed to protect yourself and your family, even if those relationships are other family members.\xa017:15 - For our listeners dealing with these same situations, remember to be strong, to give yourself boundaries, and to expect the respect that you and your family need and deserve. One of the things Nique values most in challenging moments like these is finding deep peace and knowing “I have earned it, I deserve it, and I am worth it.”\xa019:18 - Audit, Edit, and Adjust the relationships in your life! Take inventory for all of the relationships that you’re in and that affect you, and remember you deserve deep peace.\xa022:00 - You have to set you intention for your day, for your life, for your relationship! Listeners, we hope you realize that boundaries are so important, you have value yourself and to put yourself first in order to recognize how to Audit, Edit, and Adjust. Healthy relationships are what you need!\xa024:40 - Let’s get on to a fun little portion! We’re always driving around, which means we’re always grooving to good music. Meek is currently listening to Brown Skin Girl by Beyonce on repeat and repeat and repeat. Nique’s jam right now is I’m Getting Ready by Tasha Cobbs Leonard, because big things are getting ready to happen!\xa0What are you listening to?

Mamas need their fun and let their hair down too. We reminisce about life in our 20s, going to college, late nights and dancing…\xa0\xa04:40 - But now as grown, working women, being wives and mothers, how do we have fun? Meek and Nique’s journeys (and signature songs) their young lives have been different, but now they enjoy home life with their kids and family, having good conversations, and spending time with others.\xa0\xa07:00 - Nique talks about her love for travel and exploration with her husband, a highlight being dancing at a night market in Turks and Caicos. She explains, “In a sober life, you gotta have moments to connect with what is fun!”\xa08:55 - Social interaction with friends is definitely a high, especially as a mom on the go. We’re giving our all to everyone else, so fun is a way to recharge and pour back into yourself!\xa0\xa010:14 - Having fun is a priority and having more mom events is so important! Other mothers are wanting connection, needing an outlet that’s just for them, and that is so critical for us to take care of ourselves. (Triad, Triangle and Queen City mamas - be on the lookout for us, drop us a line, let’s get connected to get some events rolling!)\xa012:07 - Fun is also letting yourself indulge. Go ahead and binge watch a good TV show, eat your snacks, have sex with your partner on a Tuesday morning! Find your own definition of fun.\xa016:55 - One thing to keep in mind is that we don’t have to do it all - we don’t have to struggle! Family support is key in keeping you sane, happy, and allowing you the time you need to have fun. Meeks talks praise on her great in-laws, who take care of her kids and gives her time to have time to herself. Nique’s in-laws are helping to care for her family’s dog, Onyx, so she can pursue the podcast, travel, yoga, and all the things that come with being a mama.\xa020:45 - We share some funny stories about some strangers that came knocking on your door...

Meet and Nique are North Carolina-based, highly melanated mamas cranking out podcasts every Tuesday.\xa02:15 - Today, we’re talking all things motherhood, career, spirituality, being a wife, doing it all.

For the pilot, we’re literally talking about tea that Meek makes as part of her every morning ritual. On the other hand, Nique is resisting her alarm clock and battling traffic on her way to work.\xa0\xa014:10 - Nique gives us some insight as to how she’s managed motherhood, raised a whole 18-year-old adult and accomplished everything while hitting the 10 years sober milestone!

We’re joined by Michelle Adams, Constitutional Law Professor at Cardozo School of Law, who is writing a book on this important and under-appreciated case.Based in Detroit, this case functionally halted the promise of Brown v Board of Education at the city limits, allowing all-white suburbs (created through policies like redlining) to maintain all-white schools.

From February to August of 2017, they released a 14 part series called Seeing White.  Many discussions of race focus on anyone who isn\'t white, leaving whiteness as the default, or the norm.  This series, as they say, turns the lens around to look at whiteness directly - what does it mean?  where did it come from?We are thrilled to present some highlights from their series here, with some additional discussion of how these topics relate more directly to school integration.  We highly recommend listening to the entire series, as we think it holds incredibly important lessons about race, about America, and about how we might move forward as a country.As a disclaimer, in editing together this episode, we have left behind a lot of the context, and while the ideas speak for themselves, at times, they may feel like a pretty bit leap.

Board at 65: The Stories We Tell Ourselves, we take some time to grapple with the stories we have heard.  Reflecting on what our guests have shared (Dr. Rucker Johnson, Dr. Noliwe Rooks, Dr. Amanda Lewis, David Hinojosa, Greg and Carol), we talk with Anna about what we have learned and where do we go from here. For the path forward, why does it matter to distinguish between desegregation and integration, to decenter whiteness, and to think about the interactions between policy and cultural shifts?Links:-Children of the Dream: Why School Integration Works - Rucker Johnson-Cutting School: Privatization, Segregation, and the End of Public Education - Noliwe Rooks- Despite The Best Intentions: How Racial Inequality Thrives in Good Schools - Amanda Lewis and John Diamond-Linda Darling-HammondPlease share this series, and subscibe.

I Hope They Hear it in Our Voices is a conversation with two black parents who live in different parts of the U.S. and who have had very different -- yet very similar -- school experiences. Greg and Carol tell us a lot about how far we have (not) come since Brown v. Board, about how much work we still have to do, and the very real costs of “access to resources”.

Board at 65: The Stories We Tell Ourselves series, we talk with Civil Rights attorney David Hinojosa. School segregation is too often painted as binary issue between black and white people; learning other histories shows that this is far from true. Complicating the picture of what preceded and came as a result of Brown v. Board, David shares a history lesson on the segregation of Latinx communities across the US since the late 1800s. We discuss the politics of race and language, the importance of shared experiences and the deep fights for educational justice that continue to this day.LINKS:-San Antonio Independent School District v.

Board at 65: The Stories We Tell Ourselves series. Dr. Lewis’s research takes her to a school that is desegregated on paper but segregated within the building. It is a school, like many, with “race neutral” policies that hide the very real racialized practices in the building.  Add to that a dose of opportunity hoarding, and equitable policies become very difficult to institute.  Brown v. Board focused on desegregating schools rather than integrating classrooms, but the story we tell about it is that it ended our racist school policies.  While that may feel good, our “good intentions” do not absolve us from the impact of our actions.Amanda Lewis Race In The Schoolyard Karolyn Tyson Integration InterruptedCharles Tilley on Opportunity HoardingAnd, if you\'re in Seattle, be sure to check out BvB @65: Seattle\'s School Segregation Story, put on by the Seattle Chapter of Integrated Schools.Let us know what you think of this episode, suggest future topics, or share your story with us - @integratedschls  on twitter, IntegratedSchools on Facebook, or email us  hello@integratedschools.org.\u200bThe Integrated Schools Podcast is produced by Courtney Mykytyn and Andrew Lefkowits.

Board at 65: The Stories We Tell Ourselves series, we talk with Dr. Noliwe Rooks (Cornell). Her book, Cutting School: Privatization, Segregation, and the End of Public Education, as well as some of her more recent research around the pushback to school desegregation from communities of color and the decimation of the black teaching corps following Brown v. Board, provide context in which to understand the full range of outcomes from Brown v Board.  While Dr. Johnson, in Ep 18, showed us some of the many benefits of desegregation, Dr. Rooks reminds us of many of the costs, especially to the black community.  She asks us to engage with these stories in order to understand the very real intent behind where we find ourselves today.  It is only through changing the stories we tell, that we might envision a different, more equitable future for school integration.Let us know what you think of this episode, suggest future topics, or share your story with us - @integratedschls  on twitter, IntegratedSchools on Facebook, or email us  hello@integratedschools.org.\u200bThe Integrated Schools Podcast is produced by Courtney Mykytyn and Andrew Lefkowits.

The book now has a global audience and is\xa0 a "must have" book for all co-parenting and blended families after a divorce. \xa0 The book has characters styled as human-hybrid flowers; which themselves are a metaphor for growth and evolution towards love.\xa0 The story follows young siblings Flora and Leaf as they transition into a new and unfamiliar life between two homes- one with Mom, and one with Dad and his new wife.\xa0 Their journey highlights the challenges associated with creating extended families: a child\'s apprehension of meeting someone new, and eventually choosing to accept and embrace this person to become a part of their secular world.\xa0 With love and patience, we see a mom and a step-mom model a wonderful example of how to put their children first, working together to create a blended family with happy and confident kids. This example of unconditional love is what empowers Flora and Leaf to embrace a new definition of a typical family, and cultivate a new "normal" that benefits everyone involved. \xa0 Connect with Shannon Website Instagram Facebook Buy the book on  Amazon \xa0 Connect with me Join the Private Facebook Group Connect with me on Facebook Connect with me on Twitter Connect with me on Instagram \xa0 Send questions or feedback to melissa@blendedfamilypodcast.com Send me a voicemail at  Speakpipe Visit the website at www.blendedfamilypodcast.com Sign up for my monthly  newsletter Listen and Rate/Review on Itunes \xa0 Schedule an interview, coaching session, or financial review here Take my money quiz here to see how financially literate you are!  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0   | melissa@blendedfamilypodcast.com www.blendedfamilypodcast.com \xa0 Join me and my co host Stacy, as we talk about her experiences in a blended family.

It’s so encouraging to hear women cheering each other on and reminding one another of their strength and power.\xa0 The fact that our culture is just steeped in fear, especially regarding childbirth—which should be so beautiful—is a tragedy.\xa0 Often times this fear seems to be surrounding the idea that birth is either dangerous or painful or both.\xa0 This podcast exists to show that those are not the only options!\xa0 Birth is safe, and there’s PLENTY that can be done in the realm of comfort.\xa0 If you’re curious about that, be sure to check out the cute little pain relief cheat sheet I made for you at myhappyhomebirth.com/painrelief This little infographic cheat sheet syncs up beautifully with the series of Facebook live videos I’m currently in the middle of.\xa0 Be sure to check ‘em out!\xa0Help out the show:Leave a review on\xa0iTunes\xa0for a chance to be the reviewer of the week– you’ll be sent a Happy Homebirth sticker if selected!Take a screenshot listening to this episode and add it to your Instagram stories tagging\xa0@happyhomebirthpodcast.\xa0 We’ll add you to ours and give you a shout out!Support through joining the\xa0Patreon community.\xa0 Receive tons of exclusive offers as a show contributor!\xa0Ready to have a Happy Homebirth?\xa0\xa0Click here for my free audio mini-course!\xa0Pain Relief Cheat Sheet | \xa0Show Notes:\xa0Hillary Talbott Roland is the co-creator of the Art of Acupuncture in St. Petersburg, FL and the author of Fertile Minds Radio.

Yes.\xa0 But true.Today we speak with Shayla, who has experienced a vast array when it comes to childbirth.\xa0 From giving birth at her mother-in-law’s house (a feat in and of itself) to a hospital, to home alone, she’s done it all (and with grace, I might add!).\xa0\xa0In the beginning (you’ll get this pun later), Shayla decided to have a homebirth with her first child.\xa0 She did this because she didn’t want to deal with the pressures and protocols of the hospital.\xa0 Shayla knew she wanted to give birth naturally, and she felt that hospital staff would make her labor more difficult.\xa0 She found a student midwife to act as her care provider.\xa0\xa0At that time, Shayla knew no one who was giving birth at home.\xa0 She’d become more natural in many ways—from learning how to cure a toothache, to fertility support, and now in relation to homebirth.\xa0She went on to have her second baby at home, too, though home had moved from Mississippi to Phoenix, Arizona.\xa0\xa0With her third baby, Shayla ended up using a Certified Nurse Midwife in the hospital.\xa0 She discusses the lack of African American midwives, and how finding one can be very difficult.\xa0 We discussed the fact that Sistamidwife has a directory for these providers.\xa0Although she was able to give birth naturally in the hospital, Shayla acknowledges the difficulty she experienced.\xa0 With so many people coming in and out, it was difficult for her to get into the groove of labor.\xa0 She found it frustrating that she’d have to have “tiny arguments” with the staff about what she knew she needed for her body.\xa0With her fourth child, she maintained relationship with her CNM.\xa0 She went to prenatals regularly, though all the while she planned to give birth to her baby alone with her family at home, assuming she remained healthy. Fortunately, Shayla did remain healthy and confident.\xa0\xa0She gave birth to baby #4 on the floor in her front room after her children had gone to bed.\xa0 She said that once she began pushing, baby came so fast that her husband almost missed catching him!\xa0 Speaking of her husband, Shayla discusses how supportive he was, and how he has always thought she’d be a great candidate for a “freebirth”.\xa0Mentions In this Episode:\xa0Spinning BabiesSista MidwifeSista Girl Midwifery (North Charleston, SCLiberated Birth Movement\xa0\xa0Keep up with Shayla:\xa0WebsiteInstagramFacebookBlog\xa0Help out the show:Leave a review on\xa0iTunes\xa0for a chance to be the reviewer of the week– you’ll be sent a Happy Homebirth sticker if selected!Take a screenshot listening to this episode and add it to your Instagram stories tagging\xa0@happyhomebirthpodcast.\xa0 We’ll add you to ours and give you a shout out!Support through joining the\xa0Patreon community.\xa0 Receive tons of exclusive offers as a show contributor!\xa0 | \xa0\xa0Show Notes:\xa0For those of you who have experienced it—was postpartum anything like you thought it would be?\xa0 In fact—did you even spend much time considering it before your first birth?\xa0I’ll be the first to say that with my first child, I didn’t pay nearly enough attention to postpartum. Sure, I considered breastfeeding… but I expected this to be the one potentially difficult aspect of new motherhood.\xa0 I didn’t expect the anxiety, and I certainly didn’t expect rage.\xa0 But postpartum hormones can be…intense.\xa0Chelsea shares this experience.\xa0 As a mother who gave birth at home with her first, she felt she’d set herself up for success.\xa0 And she had!\xa0 However, that’s not the end of the work for any new mom (or at least, it shouldn’t be!).\xa0 She discusses how after a gorgeous first birth, Chelsea struggled with deep postpartum anxiety and rage.\xa0\xa0Having this experience pushed Chelsea to create Postpartum Together—an online coaching group dedicatied to the postpartum mother. She’s created a 5-month curriculum that helps mothers navigate postpartum… together.\xa0This deep understanding of the postpartum experience certainly came in handy for Chelsea after her second daughter was born.\xa0 At the 20-week ultrasound, Chelsea and her husband were informed that their daughter had a congenital heart defect.\xa0 She was able to give birth naturally (and very quickly!) at the hospital, but her daughter had to undergo heart surgery at 5 months of age—another deep stress and anxiety.\xa0\xa0Chelsea’s realness and positive outlook are an amazing encouragement for all of us, and she is doing a phenomenal job of bringing women together at such a transformative time.\xa0Keep up with Chelsea!\xa0www.strivelesslivemore.comwww.instagram.com/chelsb.skaggs\xa0Deepest Thank You to Our Sponsor!Hatched at Home- Midwife Carrie LaChapelle:www.hatchedathome.comhttps://www.facebook.com/MidwifeCarrieLachapelleLMCPM/864-907-6363Help out the show:Leave a review on\xa0iTunes\xa0for a chance to be the reviewer of the week– you’ll be sent a Happy Homebirth sticker if selected!Take a screenshot listening to this episode and add it to your Instagram stories tagging\xa0@happyhomebirthpodcast.\xa0 We’ll add you to ours and give you a shout out!Support through joining the\xa0Patreon community.\xa0 Receive tons of exclusive offers as a show contributor!
