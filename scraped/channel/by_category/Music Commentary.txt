Directed by Charlie Ahearn and starring Lee Quinones as Zoro, Wild Style would become more of a quasi-documentary of hip-hop’s on its cusp from South Bronx street culture into the global phenomenon we know today. Filled with MC, graffiti, DJ and b-boy performances from a host of now legends, Wild Style would inadvertently spread the hip-hop gospel to a generation of youth around the world, enraptured with how it depictions of an explosive, impossibly colorful subculture that few had laid eyes on outside of the five boroughs. Its soundtrack, overseen by Fab Five Freddy and Blondie guitarist Chris Stein, was largely built off an exclusive disc of original breakbeats that became the sound bed for various live performance scenes throughout the movie. Electric, dynamic and fly as hell, the\xa0Wild Style\xa0soundtrack helped capture the sound of early hip-hop’s energy and flair from A to motherf—ng Z. For a young Jeff Chang, growing up far away from the Bronx in Honolulu, Wild Style was like a secret cypher that he and his friends could pass around and decrypt. Long before the days of streaming video, if you didn’t catch a theatrical screening of this tiny, indie flick, you had to rely on nth generation bootleg dubs on VHS but as crappy as the images might have been, the inspiration was no less dimmed. This put Chang on the path to eventually become one of the most accomplished hip-hop critics in the formative ‘90s era, eventually culminating in his award winning\xa0Can’t Stop Won’t Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation\xa0(2005), which, among other things, digs deep into hip-hop’s earliest days preceding even the Wild Style era. He’s since followed that up with\xa0Who We Be: The Colorization of America\xa0(2014) and most recently, We Gon’ Be Alright: Notes on Race and Resegregation (2016) which became the inspiration behind the\xa0digital video series\xa0of the same name which just debuted this year.

The album covers multi-genres including gospel, pop and soul - Sam\'s hits, during his storied 15 year career which ended tragically with his untimely death at 33. Referred to as, "the man who invented soul" Sam Cooke hummed and crooned his way into soul music\'s canon starting with three words:\xa0You Send Me. Lee Fields\' career began 50 years ago with the release of his first single on the Bedford label "Bewildered". Since then he\'s released dance tracks, recorded with The Expressions, had his music placed in shows like Atlanta and Dear White People, toured the country and has his songs remixed by some of the best. He and Morgan discussed the gospel according to Sam Cooke, symbolism in A Change Is Gonna Come, Sam Cooke as a lyricist, Sam Cooke as a storyteller. A veteran soul singer in conversation about one of the architects of soul music It gets no better.

It was like she brought the full force of Global South dance culture in with her — gloriously bombastic — and the Sri Lankan/British singer/rapper simply didn’t sound like anyone else on the charts. For her follow-up, the idea on paper seemed smart: why not pair M.I.A. with one of the most innovative American producers of that era: Timbaland. Alas, in a post-9/11 world, Homeland Security deemed M.I.A. a threat to national security and refused to give her the necessary visa to come work in the U.S. Undaunted, M.I.A. and producer Switch jumped around the world, recording parts of what would eventually become Kala in cities across South America, Africa and Asia. The resulting masterpiece, propelled on the strength of the eventual mega-smash “Paper Planes,” all but established M.I.A. as a key voice in a different kind of new world order, one in which the borders of nationalism and colonialism were imploding and emergent movements and calls to action were part of that destabilization. As it turned out, M.I.A. didn’t need to come to the U.S. to help invade it with her sound. Kala was the album pick of this week’s guest, Lorraine Ali who currently writes about television for the Los Angeles Times but also got her start as a music critic. As one of the few Muslim American culture critics out there, Lorraine connected heavily with who and what M.I.A. represented and during the course of our conversation, we got into what it was like to listen to Kala in the wake of the second Gulf War, burgeoning refugee crises and the shifting geo-political map in which the music of the Global South could be heard as a subversive force, bamboo bangas and all.

We were not disappointed... João Gilberto was as integral to Brazil’s bossa nova movement as Ray Charles was to soul or Run DMC was to hip-hop; it’s impossible to imagine its sound and style without his touch. By 1973, Gilberto was largely living outside of Brazil and on a stint in the U.S, he rolled through New Jersey with just a single accompanying musician, percussionist Sonny Carr. Together, they crafted what’s considered a minimalist masterpiece of the genre, Gilberto’s equivalent to the Beatles’ White Album. Parts of it sound like a dream, others like a lullaby, but at the heart, it’s the soothing voice of Gilberto and his nimble guitar playing that anchors all of it. Our guest Allen Thayer, aka The Ambassador, is no stranger to Brazilian music. Though he hails from the Pacific Northwest, he’s long been fascinated with south Atlantic sounds. Author of last year’s\xa033.3 book on Tim Maia\'s Racional Vol. 1 & 2, Thayer also hosts the weekly\xa0“Brazilian Beat” radio show\xa0on KMHD and you can find him spinning Brazilian grooves (amongst other tasty treats) in and around Portland on the regular when he’s not\xa0penning articles for Wax Poetics.

Coming out hot on the heels of Amy Winehouse’s best-selling Back to Black (2007) which featured the Dap-Kings horn section, 100 Days, 100 Nights made it clear who the queen (and kings) of the retro-soul sound was. As their third album, that latest LP showcased the group’s growing prowess as songwriters and Jones was in top form with a voice able to bring heft and spark to the group’s stylings on Southern soul, uptempo funk and deep gospel. Morgan and Oliver are mostly excited to have made it to #100 and we wanted to thank all our listeners, guests and producers for their support of our show over its first two years. Here’s to 100 more!

The album sold five million units, and won a Grammy for the single "Shining Star" (Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group). Produced by Maurice White and Charles Stepney, the album focused on EWF\'s familiar themes, spirituality, oneness, love. Oscar and Golden Globe nominated composer Raphael Saadiq joined Oliver and Morgan in studio to talk "That\'s The Way of The World" and all the things that made EWF iconic including, Philip Bailey\'s falsetto, Maurice White\'s mysticisms and drum heroics, Charles Stepney\'s production and the harmonies that caught his ear and his attention and the happy feelings the band\'s music inspired in his own musicianship as a youth growing up in Oakland.

Much of the early ‘70s had seen the High Priestess of Soul escaping to Barbados, first to avoid a troubled marriage, then to avoid the IRS. But RCA Records lured her back to New York to tape a live show, much of which would go into It Is Finished alongside a few tracks from an earlier studio session. One of those vault cuts, “Funkier Than a Mosquito’s Tweeter” would become an unlikely hit on the funk/soul dance floor circuit but It Is Finished was far more than one-tracker, especially as Simone dipped into Afro-Caribbean spirituality via the (under-credited) participation of Exuma on much of this album. Our guest, Mark “Frosty” McNeill is the co-founder of the long-running Dublab internet (now terrestrial) radio station and together, we got deep into Nina’s public and personal tribulations of that era, how the album reflects a particular moment in black cultural identity and a spirited debate about Tina vs. Nina.

After about 30 minutes of experimentation, I wound up with a textured synth pad, a beepy pluck instrument, some interesting transitional noises and risers, and a Drum Rack of my dogs eating ice cubes.\xa0 This episode was recorded live as a YouTube streaming video, and the instruments are available as a free download.\xa0 Watch the video and download the free Ableton Live Pack.

Listening to this work at times is also like watching a play, as Vivaldi depicts entire scenes with the musicians as actors.

Don\'t be fooled, she is not as innocent as her name suggests. She was in fact a serial killer who admitted to killing four of her five husbands – one of whom she found in the Lonely Hearts column of a magazine. It\'s suspected that she also killed her mother, sister, mother-in-law and grandson, although she never admitted to these. Her name the Giggling Granny came about after she showed no remorse for her crimes, simply commenting that she hadn’t met her “perfect mate” yet...

She ditched her family, relocated from France to New York, and spent the rest of her life as a jazz patroness; befriending many prominent jazz musicians such as Thelonius Monk and Charlie Parker.\xa0She was affectionately known\xa0as ‘The Jazz Baroness’.

As was common in this period a cast of her face, known as a \'death mask\', was displayed in the morgue for her family to claim. Sadly she was never identified, but her story doesn\'t end there. Her peaceful expression captivated so many that very quickly moulds were made and her likeness was hung on the walls of homes across Paris. She\xa0became known as L\'Inconnue de la Seine, or The Unknown Woman of the Seine. Years later, a toy maker discovered her death mask and used it as the face of the first CPR doll, which he named Rescue Annie.

Catherine Blake was the wife of the great visionary, painter and poet, who played a crucial role in his life. As well as running the household and keeping him (relatively) sane, she took an active role in his art; assisting with painting, printing and engraving.

She is most famously known for quipping at the Emperor Theophilos at a bridal show before going on to become an abbess, poet and hymnographer, whose songs are still sung in Greek Orthodox Churches today. Despite being from a distant time, her character shines through in her work. Her quick-witted humour and somewhat rebellious one liners are what brought her to Frank\'s attention, including the phrase "I hate silence, when it is time to speak". Frank recruits the help of self-professed \'Byzantinist’ and Professor Liz James from the University of Sussex, to tell the story behind the song, The Hymn of Kassiani.

On this episode, Aquarium Drunkard founder Justin Gage sits down at AD HQ with Devendra Banhart to spin selections and discuss his new album, Ma. Then, Jason P. Woodbury joins Throwing Muses founder, solo artist, and writer Kristin Hersh backstage to discuss future sounds from Throwing Muses and Don’t Suck, Don’t Die, her book about her friend, the departed Vic Chesnutt. And to close out, Jason rings up Bill Orcutt, whose latest release, the sparse electric guitar noir, Odds Against Tomorrow, sees release October 11th. | Welcome to a late summer edition of the Aquarium Drunkard Transmissions podcast. On this episode, we’ve got two talks taped at AD HQ in Los Angeles. Up first,  Lower Dens’ Jana Hunter. On September 6th, Lower Dens releases its fourth LP The Competition. The conversation reflected on Hunter’s solo beginnings, the formation of Lower Dens and the project’s subsequent sonic evolution over the past ten years. Also discussed were the intervening years between 2015’s Escape From Evil, Hunter’s experience with gender dysphoria, and coming out the other side. And on side B: Rain Phoenix, musician, actress, and host of the LaunchLeft podcast, which returns for its second season soon. Rain founded Aleka’s Attic in the late ‘80s with her late brother River Phoenix, and has recorded as paper cranes and with the “galactic country” band Venus and the Moon. On October 31st—the same day River passed away in 1993—she releases her debut solo album, River. | You’re tuned into the Aquarium Drunkard Transmissions broadcast…welcome back. We’re happy to launch the third season of our out-there conversations about art, culture, and whatever else gets our imaginations going. Glad to have you along for the ride.\xa0This month, we bring you the uncut edition of Justin Gage’s conversation with comedian, musician, actor, songwriter, and all-around creator Tim Heidecker. Heidecker put together a playlist of the classic rock that inspired his latest, What The Broken Hearted Do, and walked us through it, noting what turns him on about tracks by Joni Mitchell, Warren Zevon, Judee Sill, Songs: Ohia, and more. Then, Marty Sartini Garner reviews the recent John Coltrane boxset, Coltrane ’58: The Prestige Recordings. Compiling every song Coltrane cut as a bandleader in that pivotal year, and captures him at a crucial stage in his journey, his first true attempt to will his sax into new territory. And to close out, Justin sits down with poet and songwriter Jonathan Rice live at Gold Diggers, to discuss both his haikus—optimized for the social media age—and new album, The Long Game. |  | Welcome to the March edition of the Aquarium Drunkard Transmissions podcast, our monthly collection of audio esoterica and conversations—superbloom edition. We’ve got a pretty interesting collection of talks this month. First up, actor, writer, and covert ethnomusicologist Jason Mantzoukas joins co-host Jason P. Woodbury at Gold Diggers Sound in East Hollywood to discuss the ways improv comedy and jazz inform his work on shows like The Good Place, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Big Mouth, and Parks and Recreation. Then, an audio version of the postscript Josh Neas wrote for the late Sara Romweber, who passed away earlier this month at 55. As a member of Let’s Active, Romweber was a pivotal part of the Chapel Hill indie rock scene—as a North Carolinian, Josh brought his ground-level view to her legacy and impact on the world of independent rock & roll. And finally, we join Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker of Low at the Valley Bar in downtown Phoenix, to discuss the band’s 12th album, Double Negative, a noisy, some times claustrophobic look at our present moment. Perhaps no record has more accurately captured the confusion and tension of the current digital and societal moment. | Greetings from the rainy west. Welcome to the February episode of the Aquarium Drunkard Transmissions podcast. This episode, we’ve got a duo of musicians whose art blurs the lines between minimalism, the avant-garde, and Americana (whatever that word means in this fractured age). This episode, we’re joined by guitarist William Tyler. You might recognize him from our podcast’s theme song, “Four Corners,” or the essay he recently penned for Aquarium Drunkard,  “Cosmic Pastoral,” which drew lines connecting the tranquil sounds of Windham Hill to cosmic new age, the modern jazz and classical sounds of ECM, and William’s own music. Your host Justin Gage sat down with him at Gold Diggers in East Hollywood as part of our recurring Talk Show series, to discuss and hear live selections from his most new record, Goes West. But first, we head to Wickenburg, Arizona where Jason P. Woodbury sat down with Bruce Hornsby to discuss his brand new, just announced album, Absolute Zero. It’s out April 12th, and like everything he does, it’s hard to put it in a box. Self-produced, the record features collaborations with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, Brad Cook, ECM veteran Jack DeJohnette, guitarist Blake Mills, yMusic, Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, and others. There are moments inspired by jazz, others inspired by classical, some which draw on Hornsby’s folk and roots influences. | The owls are not what they seem. In fact, maybe nothing is exactly what it seems. Welcome to the January 2019 edition of Aquarium Drunkard’s Transmissions podcast, our monthly audio digest of the strange, fascinating, and out there. In this episode— the first of the new year—your hosts Justin Gage and Jason P. Woodbury pay a visit to the Washington town of Twin Peaks, with a conversation about the cult TV show, its many mysteries, and its 2017 revival. Then, a talk with guitarist North Carolina-based guitarist  Sarah Louise, whose beguiling new record,  Nighttime Birds and Morning Stars, will see release this week via Thrill Jockey Records. To close, Desert Oracle creator and editor Ken Layne joins us to discuss the cosmic vastness of the desert, and of course, Oumuamua, the first interstellar object detected passing through the Solar System. Does it signal the arrival of some faraway intelligence? What does it say about the unknown? And more pressingly, what does it say about our collective imagination? When David Lynch and Mark Frost’s Twin Peaks premiered on CBS in 1990, there was nothing like it. The saga, which veered from comedy to psychic drama to cosmic horror, sometimes within the same episode, hailed the beginning of an era during which television would become a format fit for auteurs. While it only ran two seasons—plus a film, Fire Walk With Me, released in 1992—the mythology it established proved an enduring one, the subject of spinoff books, audio tapes, and discussion in secretive corners of the newly established World Wide Web. In 2017, Lynch and Frost finally made another trip with Twin Peaks: The Return, a meditation on age, trauma, and possibilities. Here, co-hosts Justin Gage and Jason P. Woodbury discuss the show’s influence and impact, on the world of television, fiction, and music. On January 25, guitarist  Sarah Louise returns with Nighttime Birds and Morning Stars, a spectral collection of electronically-treated guitar music. Louise is rooted in Appalachian roots music, but her approach is not restrained, folding in elements of spiritual jazz and new age. Most of all, her music is situated in the concept of wilderness. These are ecological compositions, born from the soil and inspired by the flora and fauna of North Carolina. Nature is really the one continuous thread in my life,” Louise says, and\xa0with this record, “[I’ve realized] this is my life’s purpose: I want to share the possibility of connection with the Earth with other people.” Just as 2018 ended, author Ken Layne published an article on Popula titled “Happy Year of the Alien Invasion!” Layne is the host of Desert Oracle, a weekly radio show and podcast as well as a pocket-sized field guide to the American Southwest. He’s interested in the idea of extraterrestrial life. We hooked up with him to discuss Oumuamua, the subject of his article as well as the idea of the desert as sort of a spiritual beacon for seekers and people interested in the unknown. “Lawrence of Arabia had this great answer for the inevitable question you’d get in England, you know: ‘Why do you love the desert so much?’ His answer was, ‘Because it’s clean.’ It’s a very heavy answer,” Layne says. “It’s this kind of stark landscape that you can project yourself upon…” Episode Playlist: William Tyler – Four Corners ++ Angelo Badalamenti\xa0 – Dance of the Dream Man ++ Angelo Badalamenti – Montage from Fire Walk With Me ++ Angelo Badalamenti – Freshly Squeezed ++ Julee Cruise – Floating ++ Julee Cruise – Mysteries of Love ++ Angelo Badalamenti – Night Life in Twin Peaks (excerpt) ++ Angelo Badalamenti – The Pink Room ++ Julee Cruise -Into the Night ++ Angelo Badalamenti – Audrey’s Dance ++ Angelo Badalamenti\xa0– Don’t Do Anything I Wouldn’t Do ++ Angelo Badalamenti — Love Theme From Twin Peaks ++ Angelo Badalamenti – Laura Palmer’s Theme ++ Thought Gang – The Black Dog Runs at Night ++ Sarah Louise – Daybreak ++ Sarah Louise -Journey in Satchidananda (Alice Coltrane) ++ Sarah Louise – Floating Rhododendron ++ Sarah Louise – Late Night Healing Choir ++ Alice Coltrane – Hara Sira ++ Sarah Louise – R Mountain ++ Mary Lattimore – Remember When Your Mom Wore Big Glasses and Played Her Harp | Dip into this nog.

We just published our massive and overstuffed  Year in Review feature, and to celebrate, members of the AD crew —including your hosts, Justin Gage and Jason P. Woodbury, plus Tyler Wilcox and Marty Sartini Garner, to discuss the year in music. Touched on: some of our favorite albums, essential reissues and archival sets, and what music the AD team is planning on spending time with in\xa0the new year. Then, Aquarium Drunkard veteran Joe Crosby cozies up by the proverbial hearth to discuss  A Charlie Brown Christmas, a 1965 special based on Charles M. Schulz’s Peanuts characters. Featuring the music of the Vince Guaraldi Trio, it’s not only a hallmark of the season, but a truly radical exploration of spiritual authenticity. In a world of cheap glitz, it remains a work of genuine, heartfelt art. | Welcome to the November edition of the Aquarium Drunkard Transmissions podcast. It\'s nearly the end of the year, and we\'re looking back on 2018\'s Lagniappe Sessions. Launched in 2011, the Lagniappe Sessions is an audio series that features artists covering songs that mean something to them. Hailed as "an amazing deep cut creation factory" by Jesse Jarnow, author of \xa0Heads: A Biography of\xa0Psychedelic America and Wasn’t That A Time: The Weavers, the Blacklist, and the Battle for the Soul of America, the series is one of the most popular elements of Aquarium Drunkard. This episode, we discuss sessions by the Mountain Goats, Kevin Morby, the Raccoonists (Jeff, Spencer, and Sammy Tweedy), Mountain Man, Sarah Louise, and many more. Then, Aquarium Drunkard\'s Jason P. Woodbury speaks with Lola Kirke. The Mozart in the Jungle and Gemini star just released a new Christmas single, "Cross You Off My List/Little Drummer Girl." And rounding things out: an interview with CAN founder ç. A pivotal figure in the world of experimental music, Schmidt recently co-authored a book with Rob Young,\xa0All Gates Open: The Story of CAN, and he\'s got a new album out of minimalist piano pieces,\xa05 Klavierstücke. Aquarium Drunkard contributor Kyle MacKinnel brings us a talk that finds Schmidt reflecting on his creative process and modern sounds by the Wu-Tang Clan.\xa0 | Happy Halloween and welcome to the October edition of the Transmissions podcast. Hope you enjoyed our bonus podcast episode, featuring AD’s Halloween mix. If you haven’t heard it, check your feed or MixCloud. It’s essential listening. Our topics today aren’t quite as spooky, but they’re good nonetheless. First, Kurt Vile. Earlier this month he released his seventh lp, the beatific Bottle It In via Matador Records. He swung by the AD HQ to sit down with Justin and discuss the new record, recording with Dean Ween of Ween, the influence of Sonic Youth, working with Kim Gordon, and how collaborating with his “sister” Courtney Barnett helped shape the new album. The edited version of our talk is up now, but here’s the full spiel, uncut and undiluted. Then, we’re dive into the ECM Records vaults to discuss the first installment of the AD guide to the long-running jazz, classical, and experimental music label. And finally, we sit down with Aquarium Drunkard contributor Jay Steel of General General to discuss his label and Vinyl Me Please’s recent reissue of New Orleans pianist James Booker’s Lost Paramount Tapes.', 'chan_desc': 'Weekly podcast companion for the Aquarium Drunkard music blog / SIRIUS XMU satellite radio show.

From his early band Simon & Garfunkel in the 1960s through solo albums like Graceland and Rhythm of the Saints in the \'80s and \'90s, up through his recent albums So Beautiful or So What and Stranger to Stranger, Simon has made music that does what the very best art can do: it resonates with our experience, re-frames it, and introduces new timbres and ideas.Recently, Simon’s curious mind has brought him into the world of contemporary classical music, mining the microtonal sound world of Harry Partch for his last record, and, just last month, collaborating with 10 composers and the ensemble yMusic on a set at the Eaux Claires music festival. On this episode of Meet the Composer\xa0– the final of Season Three\xa0–\xa0we hear Simon\'s perspective on his career and his most recent projects, as well as exclusive audio from the festival collaboration itself.Heard a piece of music on this episode that you loved?

Clouds Forming Over Mount Baker was commissioned by the University of Pennsylvania’s Arthur Ross Gallery to accompany a landscape photograph by Eliot Porter.It’s a fitting collaboration, as Kaitlyn grew up on Orcas Island, where Mt. Baker is a visible feature. Join us for this rich, synthesized soundscape, bringing sonic life to Porter’s beautiful photograph. \xa0Clouds Forming over Mt. Baker(Eliot Porter)\xa0 | What happens when a composer writes music without pen and paper, using machines? How does that change the creative process? How does it\xa0morph the art itself?\xa0Today on Meet the Composer, our producer Alex Overington — usually behind the studio glass — takes us on a road trip to unravel the creative process of those composers who write without\xa0a score. We meet the synthesists, the samplers, the electronic musicians, and dive deep into the tools they’ve adopted to define their craft.\xa0Join us as we uncover what it means to be a composer who sculpts directly with sound,\xa0through conversations with such artists as\xa0Matmos, Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, Tyondai Braxton, Laurie Anderson, Morton Subotnick and more.\xa0Heard a piece of music you loved?

They don\'t believe me, but they don\'t know how difficult it was back when I was in my 20s and 30s.”We\'ll hear how David Lang’s group\xa0Bang on a Can\xa0helped to shape a newfound culture of support and generosity, and how the next generation of composers - including Bryce Dessner - can find creative freedom in this new landscape.\xa0Finally, we hear from Bryce what it’s like to write for “the Rolls Royce … of New Music,” with his new piece,\xa0Wires, for Ensemble Intercontemporian, led by Matthias Pintscher. \xa0Bryce Dessner\'s Wires is provided courtesy of\xa0Chester Music, part of the Music Sales Group, Ensemble Intercontemportain and SPEDIDAM (Société de Perception et de Répartition des Droits des Artistes-Interprètes.) | It was composer pitted against composer: uptown vs. downtown, tonal vs. atonal, left brain vs right brain, and these musicians were NOT pulling any punches. Composers were antagonizing each other, questioning each other\'s validity, and bad-mouthing one another; it was like the second half of the 20th century was when Western Music went through middle school, and it was brutal! “If you weren\'t being a constructivist composer, if the music wasn\'t indeed about its own structure, and its own structure wasn\'t complicated, then you were a pariah, you were rejected. You didn’t get tenure. You didn’t get a job.” That’s Robert Sirota - Nadia’s Dad - one of many composers who came of age in the midst of this feud and struggled - for years - to find a voice.On this episode of Meet the Composer, we unravel one of the most contentious periods in classical music’s history. How did this fight begin? How did it play out? Who were the contenders?\xa0 We hear from composers on both sides of this battle, and discover how, on all ends of the aesthetic spectrum, we can find value in differences.\xa0Heard a piece of music you loved?

This Meet the Composer bonus track shares an exclusive performance by Henry Threadgill\'s Zooid ensemble of I Never, recorded live by Q2 Music at the Village Vanguard on Oct. 2, 2016.Throughout his career, Threadgill\xa0has led countless ensembles with diverse\xa0instrumentations and personalities. And in each of them, he finds a way to unearth a type of asymmetry – a blend of unease and transcendence that comes across\xa0in his remarkably structured compositions. He unites musicians in the same way as he composes: with affection for the mysterious, embrace of the unexpected, and spontaneity guided by a rigorous intellect.\xa0As Threadgill\xa0has said, “Improvisation is a way to live your life and solve problems.”\xa0Music is one outlet, one way to activate this philosophy, which is something we hear echoed often\xa0from his collaborators.In this recording, we hear the 2016 Pulitzer Prize laureate leading his longest standing chamber ensemble, Zooid, in a live performance inside the legendary New York City underground jazz venue, the Village Vanguard.Performers:Henry Threadgill, alto saxLiberty Ellman, tresChristopher Hoffman, celloJosé Davila, tubaElliot Humberto Kavee, drums, percussionThis live recording was produced by Curtis Macdonald and engineered by Edward Haber (technical director and remix), Irene Trudel, Duke Markos, Bill Moss and Curtis Macdonald. | 1967, Fort Riley, Kansas. Henry Threadgill is 23 years old. Knowing he’s going to\xa0be drafted into the military, he joins the Army Concert Band, hoping to focus on his passion: writing music. As he surrounds himself with new ideas, he works his influences into the music that he\'s arranging. Then one day, the band plays one of his arrangements of a\xa0patriotic song for an inauguration of big-wigs, and from the calm of a quietly\xa0confused crowd comes a cry from a cardinal in attendance: “Blasphemy!”One day later, he’s told to gather his things. Thirty days later, he’s on his way to Vietnam. Fifty years later, he wins the Pulitzer Prize for music composition.This\xa0is only the beginning of the story of how the energy, hunger and curiosity of Henry Threadgill\xa0have influenced and changed the people around him.

Originally part of a larger work, Hoodoo Zephyr, Coast was never intended to be performed live. However, the 20-person chamber ensemble Alarm Will Sound has often been tempted by electronic works. Violinist, composer, and Alarm Will Sound\xa0member Caleb Burhans, who cut his teeth arranging works by Aphex Twin for the group, adapted Adams\' work. While Alarm Will Sound\xa0has performed this piece several times, we\'re proud to bring this you exclusive recording!\xa0 | What happens when the composer shows up to the first rehearsal of his brand-new piece? Would a living Beethoven sue for intellectual property? Are you the hit, or are you in the hole? For this episode, we collaborated with the 20-member chamber ensemble Alarm Will Sound and its conductor Alan Pierson – with whom we\'re partnering on the upcoming podcast album Splitting Adams (out April 21 on Cantaloupe Music) – to take a close look at the music of John Adams, specifically his two insanely difficult chamber symphonies.

It ALSO beat out Hole, Collective Soul, and Sheryl Crow in Bruno The Sponsor\'s "Dealer\'s Choice" Patreon Poll. We\'ll let you decide which feat is more impressive. In the meantime, let\'s go back twenty-five years to 1994 to revisit No Need To Argue and, more importantly, unpack the sordid details of Bob\'s big 9th grade fist fight.\xa0 | We\'re going back, back, back in time- 30 years to be exact. Let\'s revisit the Top 10 Billboard hits from this week in September, 1989. Hair metal, R&B ballads, pop classics, and a surprising amount of talk about the Northridge Quake of \'94. Cherish this one. | It sold 15 MILLION copies. Spawned multiple HUGE hits. Introduced the world (and, more importantly, Carlos Santana) to Rob Thomas. But in 1996... Dan and Bob HATED IT. The question is: why? Why were the teenage BFF\'s anti-Matchers? Why did they hold onto that hatred for decades? And why are they finally ready to finally give Rob & Co. a chance today? Do Matchbox 20 (twenty?) have what it takes to win them over, or... or will they push them away?\xa0 | We don\'t practice Santeria, we don\'t got no crystal ball, and we definitely don\'t have a million dollars to spend (at all). But we do have an hour or so to comb through all 18 tracks of Sublime\'s breakout 1996 LP. If you hate summer, Patreon poll winning albums, or two white guys sharing their thoughts on reggae, you might want to skip this one. Life\'s too short. | What were you doing in the summer of \'02? If you were anything like the NFL Network\'s Colleen Wolfe (a.k.a. Connie Fox a.k.a. Tiny Box\xa0a.k.a whatever her name was on her old fake I.D.)\xa0you were blasting 311 out of your \'93 Trans Am and getting ready for your senior year of high school. This week Dan, Bob, and Colleen travel back to the days of Jimmy Eat World, Avril Lavigne, and absolutely filthy hip hop to assemble the perfect Back 2 School Mix and share some high-level Mall Gossip. It\'s not so complicated. | We\'re going the distance, we\'re going for speed, and most importantly, we\'re talking about Cake\'s alternative-hit spawning sophomore album Fashion Nugget this week. The guys are gonna try to figure out exactly WHO Cake is, WHY they were chosen for a "Dealer\'s Choice" episode, HOW they won a Patreon poll, and WHAT Bob was thinking when he unironically started wearing a John McCrea inspired bucket hat in college.\xa0 | In the golden age of Britney and Durst, a famous rock act returned from the abyss to “reapply for the job of best band in the world.” Dan squealed. Bob cringed. U2 were back, right when the world was about to change forever. Coincidence? Follow the red string: B - O - N - O | Twenty years ago TODAY Limp Bizkit, Korn, Jewel, Rage Against The Machine, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kid Rock, DAVE, a boatload of other rock acts and about 400,000 drug-loving music fans arrived in Rome, NY for the most disastrous music festival of all time (sorry Fyre Fest fans, it\'s true.) Dan and Bob didn\'t make the trip from Pearl River, but they did watch with bated breath as Kurt Loder reported on the fires, the chaos, and (occasionally) the music. On Woodstock \'99\'s twentieth anniversary, let\'s go back and revisit the insanity by pushing play on the live album that was released to celebrate the festival.\xa0 | Can you put a Parental Advisory sticker on a podcast? This week, Dan and Bob dive into THE BEST SELLING ALBUM of the 21st century! So if you\'re a fan of huge hit singles, casual misogyny, and rampant homophobia, this is the episode for you.

He leaps right in with a detailed analysis of Idiot Wind, praises previous guest Michael Gray, quotes Simon Armitage and Clinton Heylin, applauds Desire and Scorsese’s Rolling Thunder Revue and hails Dylan’s voice: “you always believe what he’s saying, even though he’s always an unreliable witness. It’s his incredible narrative power”.\xa0A few of the many topics: the 1978 Blackbushe gig (“explosively exciting”), his early years as Dylan freak (“I look back fondly on the exchange of cassette tapes in a pub – the early Christian era of Dylan bootlegs, this circle of initiates”) and the cleaned-up release of I’m Not There (“the value of it was somewhat diminished, I felt”). Geek out with Geoff in this passionate episode.\xa0Geoff Dyer is the author of Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi and three previous novels, as well as nine non-fiction books. Dyer has won the Somerset Maugham Prize, the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for Comic Fiction and was named GQ’s Writer of the Year.

Robyn first saw our man at the Isle of Wight Festival at the age of 16 (“with his white suit and his new voice, it was like watching your beloved get off the train but – it’s not them. I was riveted. I just stared.”) A conversation with Nashville cats Charlie McCoy and Wayne Moss is recounted, BD and Jim Morrison are skilfully imitated, Blonde On Blonde is rhapsodised (“You can see that music. It’s visual, like fireworks, like LSD. It’s in my DNA”). Strip your senses for this magic swirling ship of an episode.Robyn Hitchcock\xa0is a London-born, Nashville-based singer, songwriter, surrealist poet, cult artist and musician\'s musician. Since founding the art-rock band The Soft Boys in 1976, he has recorded more than 20 albums and starred in ‘Storefront Hitchcock’ a concert film by Jonathan Demme.\xa0Blending folk, psychedelia and British nihilism, Robyn describes his songs as ‘paintings you can listen to’.

He won a role in the landmark 1968 London production of Hair by singing Outlaw Blues and Highway 61 Revisited. His drama school years were dramatised by Camden Town flatmate Bruce Robinson in the cult film Withnail & I. “It looked pretty much like it did in the movie. Biba bags hanging over lights and all that sort of caper”.\xa0His Brighton Mod scooter and soul thing was shattered the first time he saw the cover and heard the contents of The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan. “Whatever else I was into, like Elvis, Dylan always had a place within and yet beyond that. It always fitted in and yet it never did.” Desolation Row is dissected and applauded: “The words and images hit me straight away. I see it as a dusty street in Mexico”. The Beatles, The Band, The Rolling Stones, Gram Parsons, Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson are all name-checked by our self-confessed “musicologist geek” in this classic episode.Michael Feast is a stage and screen actor: a veteran of the Royal Exchange, The Old Vic, the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. He worked several times with Sir John Gielgud, whom he later portrayed in the West End. Feast’s many television appearances include State of Play, Silent Witness, Vera and Game of Thrones.

A shape-shifting performer himself, Christopher temporarily gave up on Dylan when he heard Tracey Thorn berate him in her song Me and Bobby D, thinking: “he’s the voice of the Patriarchy and he can’t even sing”.\xa0In this episode, we grapple with some controversial questions: should we overlook an artist’s biography when considering their work? Does Bob sing with deep emotion? (His most recent recording He’s Funny That Way gets a look-in.) And we receive our most unusual piece of advice: “when you’re at an orgy with a friend, don’t look at their face”. Join us as we discover Christopher’s “secret relationship” with Bob Dylan.\xa0Christopher Green is a writer and performer whose work includes comedy, cabaret, theatre and live art. He is best known for his work as a character comedian, in a range of personas, playing at venues such as The Royal Albert Hall and Sydney Opera House.

A passionate Dylan man, Sarfraz first saw Bob in 1990, camping out with other hardcore fans for tickets at Hammersmith Odeon (he tips his hat to the legendary ‘Lambchop’).\xa0Topics include Oh Mercy (“...it feels like a contemporary album. That swampy, darker take on things feels right for now”) and Bob’s age when he recorded it (“he seemed a Methuselah-like prophet, but was the same age I am now!”). In our three-way conversation, Dylan shares centre stage with Springsteen: Sarfraz is a big fan of their “appalling” live duet of Highway 61 Revisited. Don’t miss this surprising episode with the summer’s filmic man of the moment.\xa0Born in Pakistan, Sarfraz Manzoor is a British journalist, documentary maker and broadcaster. He is a regular contributor to The Guardian, presenter of documentaries on television and radio and a cultural commentator who appears on programmes such as Radio 4’s Saturday Review.

Sheila takes us behind the scenes of the most successful theatre adaptation of Dylan’s work.Did Bob come to see it? “I had a fantasy of him in a trench coat and hat, leaving a little post-it note at the stage door, saying “well done”. But that didn’t happen. A mug with his name on it was printed for him. I don’t know who has it now!”Sheila Atim’s acting credits include Othello (Shakespeare’s Globe), The Tempest and Julius Caesar (Donmar Warehouse) and Les Blancs (National Theatre) as well as work for the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Court.

Topics include Bob and Brecht, Dylan and The Dead (“like orange juice and milk”), his disbelief in Tom Waits and his amazement at Bob’s awards ceremony persona (“such a tiny, eccentric, weird little guy!”).\xa0Tracks explored include Early Roman Kings (“can I be bothered with this?”) and North Country Blues (“deep American poetry”). Along the way, the mysterious location of the Red River Shore is cleared up and Roll On John is pronounced “a fantastic song”.Stephen Unwin is a director, writer and teacher.

He goes on to describe “the fairly heavy occasion” backstage at Earl’s Court in 1978 with his young son, who bums a biro off Bianca Jagger to seek Bob’s forbidden (left-handed) autograph.Countless tracks and albums are measured up, praised or dismissed, including the recent Sinatra years: “horrible finger snapping”. Don’t miss this opportunity to hear unvarnished opinions and future plans from the man who changed the face of Dylan criticism.Michael Gray is a world authority on the work of Bob Dylan. His Song & Dance Man: The Art of Bob Dylan, published in 1972, was the first full-length critical study of Dylan’s work.

Seems we owe it all to Linda, the university girlfriend who introduced him to Bob’s work. “Coming from a rock ‘n’ roll background, I had no interest in folk-clubbery; it just seemed weird”. Soon he was marvelling at the poetry and, at Liverpool in 1966, Dylan’s “extraordinary ability to recite at length, stoned out of his head, yet word perfect.”Michael talks us through the various editions of his classic Song & Dance Man, from the slim first edition to the gigantic third version, which Uncut called “dazzlingly brilliant... an intellectual tour de force... an essential companion”. In between, we hear about his relationship with “the bony figure who came through the middle of the curtain” and changed his life.Michael Gray is a world authority on the work of Bob Dylan.

GET OUT OF THE WAY!” Young Dorian continued to be unmoved by Dylan’s 1997 heart condition: “Oh, I guess he’s dying now: Time Out Of Mind is the mortality album”.\xa0He has since revised his opinion. “I like his weird, apocalyptic psycho-geography of America.” He admires the man’s indifference: “Piss off. I’m going to disappoint you again”. In-depth discussions include: Masters Of War, the upcoming Neil Young Hyde Park concert, Greil Marcus, Chronicles Volume One and the best Dylan cover versions (check out Phil Flowers And The Flower Shop’s version of Like A Rolling Stone).\xa0Dorian’s books include The Ministry Of Truth: A Biography of George Orwell’s 1984, 33 Revolutions Per Minute: A History of Protest Songs and The Guardian Book of Playlists.

We discuss Lennon\'s songs from the albums both musically and lyrically, and talk about where these efforts fit into Sean\'s catalog. Very interesting music, to say the least!Email: ivegotabeatlespodcast@hotmail.com | Let\'s go back to June 1966 to hear the Beatles play their first concerts in Germany since 1962. They are recording Revolver at the time, and yet their live show is filled with tunes from a few years ago. We discuss the set list, the performances, and the importance of the performance in context.We also share some recent Beatles news related to various releases, as well as the upcoming\xa0Abbey Road\xa0super deluxe box set. Enjoy!@ivegotabeatlesivegotabeatlespodcast@hotmail.com | In this episode, we revisit George Harrison\'s 1979 self-titled solo album. Was this George\'s high point at the end of the 1970s?

Paul released his flop movie\xa0Give My Regards To Broad Street, John\'s\xa0Milk and Honey\xa0was released posthumously, Ringo did some TV work and hosted SNL, and George made a guest appearance with another famous British group. Oh, and a Beatle son released his first and most successful album. We discuss what other music was like during that year, and why the Beatles were particularly adrift and lost in their creative careers. | We\'re back after a bit of a hiatus with a new episode digging into Ringo Starr\'s 1972 single, "Back Off Boogaloo." We talk about the music and lyrics, sample some covers (including a Czech one for Dave!), and even get into a little disagreement about Ringo\'s brother-in-law, Joe Walsh.\xa0We\'re back now, so stay tuned for more episodes soon!ivegotabeatlespodcast@hotmail.comFacebookTwitter: @ivegotabeatles', 'chan_desc': 'An educational, informative, and irreverent look at all things Beatles with Dave and Chris.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts2/v4/37/82/53/37825323-5027-58c7-2046-a13509f78df5/mza_4736659098524375998.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2012-05-09'}}

Founded in 2010 while members Phlecia and Josh were attending the University of Kentucky. Year of October started out as an acoustic singer/songwriter group, but soon made the transition to a full band which completed their truly unique sound. Their dedication and love for their craft shines through in their first album “Stories” released in early 2012. With influences from The Black Keys and Led Zeppelin to Norah Jones they are led by bluesy vocals, strong lyrics, and roaring guitars that create a sound reminiscent of the 70s but making it all new. They worked for two years on their next release and put out their second record, “Golden Days,” in October of 2014. They developed their sound and really toned in their own brand of fuzzy rock. They continued to perform live as often as they could for the next two years and they began working on their third release in 2016.After three years of playing live and working on new tunes they released their third record “Trouble Comes” on October 31st, 2017. This is their hardest rocking record yet and boast lots of dirty riffs and dark grooves to go along with their deep and powerful vocals.

You are trying to fill the gaps in your own knowledge so you can become better than you are now.The 8 Strategies For the Ideal Apprenticeship are:Value learning over money.Keep Expanding Your HorizonsRevert to a Feeling on InferiorityTrust the processMove towards resistance and painApprentice yourself in failureCombine the "How" and the "What"Advance Through Trial and ErrorTranscriptWelcome back to the Art of Composing Podcast. I am excited to have you listening today.Today\'s episode is going to be about Mastery. What it is, how we can attain it, and why we would want to attain it. But I am not going to just talk about Mastery as an obscure theory. Instead, I thought this would be a good opportunity to a little bit talk about my history, how I started composing, how I got to where I am, and how I see my journey unfolding. I don\'t consider myself a master of music composition, but I am working towards it. And I hope part of the reason my website, artofcomposing.com resonates with people is because I am approaching the subject of teaching music composition from the standpoint of having to teach myself.So without further ado, let\'s get on with the featured content.Featured ContentMastery is a subject not often touched on or talked about in modern society. If you think about it, most things in life are really designed to prevent you from mastering a subject.The biggest culprit for this, I believe, is not TV, although TV doesn\'t help. No I believe its school. School is designed, from the beginning, to be a place of conformity and regurgitation. You are forced through your most creative, and curious part of your life to listen to teachers talk about subjects you just don\'t care about. And then after the day is done, you have to go home and study those same subjects, and do your homework.This all leads to a lack of motivation on the part of children to care much about school.For me personally, this lead to a habit of procrastinating. You see, procrastination really has nothing to do with you being lazy. I was and I still am, a hard worker. The thing is, I just never wanted to work on what I had to work on. Homework, diaramas, reports, papers, whatever.Let me say first though, that this has nothing to do with the teachers themselves. I had some great teachers growing up, and I have friends now that are teachers, and many of them care deeply about the kids they teach. But they are in a system that is designed to create factory workers, not mastery.So why am I talking about this.Well, I want to make it clear that mastery is attainable for anyone. That is right. Anyone can be a master of their chosen field. Obviously, | Episode 4 of the Art of Composing Podcast. This episode is all about starting on the pathway to mastery. What is mastery? Well, it is the state that you achieve, where you have almost magical powers of control over your chosen field. How do you achieve master? You\'ll just have to listen and find out. I also talk about how I started composing, how I got off the path towards my life\'s task, and what it took to get back on the pathway.What is in this episode:What is mastery, and how do you achieve it.Jon - An Autobiography (kind of)How to identify your life\'s task using the 5 strategies from Mastery by Robert Greene.Resources and Links Mentioned in this Episode:Mastery by Robert GreeneWar of Art by Steven PressfieldEpisode 4 Take AwaysMastery is really about a state you can achieve, in which you have a power over reality that most people do not have. This power comes from fully absorbing all aspects of you life\'s task.Your life\'s task is the thing that you feel deep down, that you are called to do.To identify your life\'s task, you have five strategies:Returning to your origins is basically connecting with your true passions.Occupying the Perfect Niche is all about working your way towards a life that will support and nurture your life\'s task.Avoiding the false path is all about not being steered in the wrong direction.Letting Go of the Past is about looking at the direction you\'re life has been taking, and having the courage to say whether you\'ve been on a false path, even if you\'ve worked hard in a particular field.Finding Your Way Back is about being willing to make a cut with the progress you\'ve made in order to get back on your true path towards mastery.Transcript - AOC 004', 'chan_desc': "Jon Brantingham talks about everything related to music composition, music theory, and creativity, to get you started on the right foot while learning to compose.

That\'s not the case with Juno, and their 1999 debut album This Is The Way It Goes And Goes And Goes on DeSoto Records. Like their then label-mates Shiner, Juno unleashes a big, layered guitar sound, but Shiner sound much leaner in comparison, as Juno gets full usage out of their three axe attack. The sound shifts from a hoe-gaze influenced, wall of sound approach that dips its toes in the space and math rock sub-genres, as delayed guitar leads bleed over lush mid-range distortion, to straight-on instrumental jams that would find a nice spot on any Explosions In The Sky album.\xa0Songs In This Episode:\xa0Intro - Rodeo Programmers11:26 - A\xa0Listening Ear14:55 - The Great Salt Lake/Into the Lavender Crevices of Evening the Otters Have Been Pushed20:33 - January Arms27:15 - Leave a Clean Camp and a Dead FireOutro - All Your Friends Are Comedians\xa0Support the podcast, join the DMO UNION at Patreon.Listen to the episode archive at\xa0DigMeOutPodcast.com.\xa0 | What if Nick Cave or Mark Lanegan decided to record an album of Bob Marley, ZZ\xa0Top, War, and Slim Harpo covers?\xa0That\'s the question posed by the 1993 album The Honeymoon Is Over by The Cruel Sea, an instrumental blues and surf band from Australia that added Beasts of Bourbon frontman Tex Perkins to create a weird and oddly compelling album. Somehow, that combination managers to come together better than we could have ever expected, as the players involved completely buy into the swampy grooves with organ stabs, lurching bass lines and more. It may not be for everyone, and we may not even agree on it completely, but it\'s definitely worth a spin to reorient your understanding that the 90s weren\'t just grunge, pop-punk, industrial rock, etc.\xa0Songs In This Episode:\xa0Intro - Delivery Man5:27 - Black Stick14:36 - Naked Flame21:48 - Woman With SoulOutro - Better Than Love\xa0Support the podcast, join the DMO UNION at Patreon.Listen to the episode archive at\xa0DigMeOutPodcast.com.\xa0 | On their 1994 debut album Rubberneck, the Toadies managed to score a hit single that is still a staple of rock stations spinning 90s alternative hits. But like a lot of people, that one single is our starting point with the band. When we gave the entire album a listen, we discovered a band confident from the get-go in their style and strengths - energetic, concise, no-frills alternative riff-rock with a distinctive lead vocalist. Spending time with the record, the deeper layers revealed themselves - a circular rockabilly-esque riff on I Come From The Water, nods to the blues-based thump Led Zeppelin on Backslider - without being obvious or sounding dated. But the superior single Possum Kingdom also made us wonder what happened to the distinctive and inventive lead guitar driving that tune, and wonder if this material translated better to the live setting.\xa0Songs In This Episode:\xa0Intro - Possum Kingdom17:59 - I Burn20:17 - I Come From The Water22:22 - BacksliderOutro - Quitter\xa0Support the podcast, join the DMO UNION at Patreon.Listen to the episode archive at\xa0DigMeOutPodcast.com.\xa0\xa0 | To paraphrase a rock \'n roll saying, you get a lifetime to make your first record, but six months to make your second. As we\'ve discovered in our Sophomore Slump Revisited series, it is not always the case that limited time causes the dreaded Sophomore Slump. Record label management shake-ups, shifting radio playlists and various other factors have impacted the success or failure of second albums. But what about the opposite? Bands that made okay or solid freshman efforts, but kicked it up a notch on their sophomore album and finally "discovered their sound" or "delivered on their promising debut." Or bands that released massive, chart-topping first albums, only to equal or exceed with their follow-up. There\'s a lot to cover, and a lot to discuss as we talk about a bunch of bands and albums that reversed the curse of the Sophomore Slump.\xa0Songs In This Episode:\xa0Intro - Sophomore Jinx by Self9:57 - Cut Your Hair by Pavement24:34 - Not Too Late by Satchel37:20 - Pen Pals by Sloan48:41 - Until You Came Along by Golden SmogOutro - Spice Up Your Life by Spice Girls\xa0Support the podcast, join the DMO UNION at Patreon.Listen to the episode archive at\xa0DigMeOutPodcast.com.\xa0 | While we\'ve touched on some alternative country over the years on the podcast, we\'ve never encountered a straight-up folk record. Until now. Thanks to a patron selection, we checked out the 1999 debut album Bareback by Hank Dogs. A\xa0family band with lineage to the Sex Pistols, we had no idea what to expect, though the name and album cover tipped us off to something country-ish. The reality is much more traditional, recalling the English folk of The Fairport Convention, Pentangle, Steeleye Span, Richard Thompson, etc. - all well outside our respective wheelhouses. But albums like this help expand our musical horizons, even if they fall victim to the overstuff compact disc era, and foreshadow the 2000s folk and freak-folk revival.\xa0Songs In This Episode:\xa0Intro - Lucky Break13:06 - 18 Dogs19:52 - I\'m An Angel25:27 - Take Back My Own HeartOutro - Sun Explodes\xa0Support the podcast, join the DMO UNION at Patreon.Listen to the episode archive at\xa0DigMeOutPodcast.com.\xa0 | If we told you that a soul/blues singer from Detroit released a record on Sub Pop on 1996 backed by funk rockers Big Chief, who had themselves just released an album influenced by 70s Blaxploitation films, you\'d think we\'d have a crazy game of Mad Libs going on. But the end result of Thornetta Davis\' debut solo album Sunday Morning Music is much more traditional than expected, find space between the 1990s neo soul of Maxwell, D\'Angelo and Erykah Badu, and the new wave of young American blues artists like Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepard. \xa0Songs In This Episode:\xa0Intro - Helpless10:38 - Only One13:58 - Cry21:01 - And I\xa0SpinOutro - Come Go With Me\xa0Support the podcast, join the DMO UNION at Patreon.Listen to the episode archive at\xa0DigMeOutPodcast.com.\xa0 | If there is a new episode of Dig Me Out in your feed on a Thursday, that can only mean one thing - we sharing with you a preview of our latest Dig Me Out \'80s episodes.

Tour, Ozzfest, Family Values Tour and others. We\'re heading back to 1995 to revisit the Warped Tour, from those who attended it and those who played it, gaining insight on the various line-up incarnations of the 90s, as well as the evolving line-up of artists, that started as a pop-punk-ska skate boarding, but morphed into a broader "youth-oriented"\xa0festival thanks to co-founder Kevin Lyman. We learn the various quirks (daily line-up shuffling!), the queasy (no showering for days! port-a-potties!) and the community that was built over twenty-five years of the Warped Tour.\xa0Songs In This Episode:\xa0Intro - Al\'s War by Less Than JakeOutro - History Of A\xa0Boring Town by Less Than Jake\xa0Support the podcast, join the DMO UNION at Patreon.Listen to the episode archive at\xa0DigMeOutPodcast.com.\xa0\xa0 | When singer/guitarist Toni Halliday and multi-instrumentalist Dean Garcia paired up to form Curve in 1989, they already had established bonafides in the music world with previous releases on Anxious Records, set-up by Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics. While those efforts failed to connect, their three 1991 EPs gained enough momentum that the 1992 debut album Doppelgänger, with assistance from soon to be in-demand producer Flood, was primed for widespread acclaim and respectable sales. Doppelgänger cracked the top twenty UK album chart, but their sound, an at times hypnotic combination of noisy-pop, shoegaze, dreamy textures and Madchester big beats, failed to connect with a larger audience, a sound that years later Garbage would refine for the mid-nineties radio waves. But for all the forward thinking and ahead-of-its-time accolades, there is a decidedly 1990s time stamp to the wall of sound approach, especially in the layered drums and percussion that left us equally fatigued and fascinated.\xa0Songs In This Episode:\xa0Intro - Horror Head13:25 - Ice That Melts The Tips19:41 - Sandpit26:30 - Lillies Dying29:48 - Split Into Fractions29:57 - Mine All Mine (Van Halen)Outro - Fait Accompli\xa0Support the podcast, join the DMO UNION at Patreon.Listen to the episode archive at\xa0DigMeOutPodcast.com.\xa0 | If you are checking us out for the first time, you\'ll quickly learn what our regular listeners already know: reggae and/or ska were not our thing back in the 1990s. Now, we\'re not going to claim to have fully converted to fandom, but the 1996 album Forever = 1 Day by Fighting Gravity left us with positive vibes. When the band locks into a relaxed mid-tempo groove, we\'re fully on board. When they occasionally pick up the pace to skanking speeds, or slow to a new age crawl, we found less reason to stay engaged. We got to explore all sides of the band, as well as the dig into the touring regional band phenomenon prevalent in the 1990s with access to cheap CD\xa0replication and an established college fraternity circuit that will no doubt come up again in future episodes.\xa0Songs In This Episode:\xa0Intro - One Day12:20 - Fools And Kings21:35 - Ted\'s River Song31:22 - Quiet AngelOutro - Mission Bells\xa0Support the podcast, join the DMO UNION at Patreon.Listen to the episode archive at\xa0DigMeOutPodcast.com.\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'Dig Me Out is a weekly podcast dedicated to making time to dig up your favorite 90s rock.

Introducing the musicians. Yakkin\' it up with the little people... the fans who make it all possible! \xa0I have samples here from Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt (one of the best!), Jesse McReynolds, and plenty more to get you on the right path. Samples and ten tips to sharpen your image on stage. \xa0If you enjoy my podcast I hope you will keep this show going and growing by joining "the club" over on my Patreon page.

It\'s funny that their use is almost required in bluegrass if you play banjo or guitar. But they are heavily frowned on with the mandolin. If you don\'t know how to use a capo you can learn here on my website.\xa0\xa0 If you enjoy my podcast I hope you will keep this show going and growing by joining "the club" over on my Patreon page.

In this show I talk more specifically about the options you have for recording. There are four levels beginning with the simple portable recorder, to the portable stereo digital recorder, to digital multi-track "porta-studios" and onwards to computer/software based recording. \xa0I hope this information helps you choose where to begin when you want to record some bluegrass based upon the purposes you have in mind.\xa0The Mandolin Treasure Chest which I spoke about at the beginning of the show is fully described here: http://www.bradleylaird.com/treasure\xa0\xa0If you enjoy my podcast I hope you will keep this show going and growing by joining "the club" over on my Patreon page.

In this introduction I discuss the difference between analog and digital, why we record, and talk some about older technologies such as the Edison cylinder and magnetic tape. \xa0I think this background primer will help you even if all you want to do is record your banjo picking on an iPhone app. Do you know what an A/D converter is? If you talk on a cell phone you use them everyday! Do you know how to make your own record player with a sheet of paper and a pin? This fun stuff and more are contained within. \xa0Technical note: I saved this audio file in a larger, less compressed format than I have been using. It should improve the audio quality just a bit but make it a tad slower to download.

After giving you a rundown of the trials and tribulations of starting up my own bluegrass jam session--with four weeks under our belts-- I answer a listener\'s question about trying to decide whether to join a band or just sit around playing quietly at home after the kids go to sleep.\xa0I hope that my direct and honest approach does not offend too many people, but by golly, you deserve to be happy too! It is a balancing act and I think I do a better job talking about in the podcast than trying to describe my thoughts here in this description.

In fact, everybody is going to strike out sometimes. That\'s all part of the bluegrass game.

There are two main types of instrumentals and three variations of vocal songs. Recognizing these structural differences will help you determine what to do during your solos and to better arrange songs for your band or jam session. \xa0I present audio examples of each structure type. After listening to this you\'ll never ask this question "Am I supposed to play the verse or the chorus during my break."

You either recover or go into a chaotic spin towards earth. Hearing the warning signs and being able to correct before it is too late is vital for maintaining safe and level flight. The same is true for learning to make music. I\'ll explain in this podcast. \xa0Contrary to your natural instinct, the solution to counteracting a stall is to push the nose down. Yikes!!! Your reaction will be to pull back on the stick to avoid the sudden stop when you hit the ground! You must gain air speed and point your nose down.

Listen as the Snobs combine the two shows to go deep on the (im)perfect marriage of cinema and sound. The crew explores the natural relationship between music and movies while questioning which artform impacts the audience the most. The ensuing debate inevitably leads to a wild roundtable: What movie soundtrack do you absolutely love even though you have no desire to ever see the movie again? | This is an episode you don’t want to miss. As we celebrate the 45th anniversary of his seminal LP, "Fulfillingness’ First Finale", The Music Snobs dedicate an entire ep to the incomparable Stevie Wonder. The crew examines a specific period of Stevie’s career long enough to ask a vital question: what is it that makes the albums Stevie released between 1971 and 1976 so classic, and how can we explain the undeniable impact they’ve had on music ever since? Join TMS in paying tribute to a musician whose work helped to shape our lives and forever changed our world. | What determines whether or not a musical artist is authentic? Are artists like Solange and Tyler, The Creator showing us who they really are, or are modern celebrities more manufactured than ever before? Sht gets real on the latest episode of The Music Snobs. The crew dives into the very definition of authenticity in the music biz, then takes it up a notch by calling out the fakers and questioning why "keeping it real" is so important in black music. Before the episode ends, the Snobs get even realer during the roundtable by admitting: what universally beloved artist, album, or song is—in your opinion—actually terrible? | On this episode The Music Snobs are asking our Stans to answer an important question: Are the superfans of today valued experts and a vital force for the world to hear new music, or are they a cancer on music appreciation? Get ready to confront your truths and admit your biases while we explore fandom in the age of online armies and off the rails obsession. To wrap up the ep, we ask each Snob: what was your most memorable encounter with a celebrity? | Have you ever wondered how an unknown Atlanta duo broke through a landscape dominated by the East and West coasts to become, arguably, the greatest hip-hop group of all time? So did The Music Snobs. To answer that question, and many more, we invited singer Keisha Jackson—an eyewitness to the rise of music’s favorite ATLiens—to sit-in with us and dive deep into the legacy of André Benjamin and Antwan Patton. Along the way, the Snobs discuss everything from the origins of the Dungeon Family to the dichotomy of tour buses. Join us as we celebrate the 25th anniversary of OutKast. Special Guest: Keisha Jackson. | Although he defines the term ‘iconic’, it’s a safe bet that you don’t know enough about the artist whose career has influenced everyone from Amy Winehouse to Drake. The Music Snobs dive into the style and legacy of Ol’ Blue Eyes and examine the impact of Sinatra’s cool on every aspect of pop culture. | This is the episode only The Music Snobs could do. In this era of music streaming, corporate interests, and brand dominance, we take an uncomfortable look at the role of music journalism in the digital age. Guest-Snob and Vibe Magazine Editor-in-Chief, Datwon Thomas, joins us to ask some important questions. Is genuine music criticism still alive? Or are modern journalists too afraid to bite the hand that feeds them? The crew also finds time to present “All the Critics Love U”—a roundtable discussion that asks: what decision did a critic or awards show get stratospherically wrong? Special Guest: Datwon Thomas. | Welcome to Season 1, Episode 1 of The Music Snob’s new format! To kick things off we’ve centered this episode around one of today’s most innovative and promising artists: Anderson .Paak. Join us as the Snobs discuss .Paak’s unique brand of music and his atypical rise to stardom. Then get ready for this season’s first roundtable: What great song by one artist would fit perfectly into another artist\'s catalogue? | When Childish Gambino released This Is America he verified a burgeoning truth: sight is the new sound. With the recording industry now dominated by the visual appeal of online and mobile content, TMS asks: what does the power of YouTube, video albums, and Instagram branding mean for the future of actual music? Stick around for a picture-perfect roundtable when the Snobs ask each other: what album would have been better received with different cover art? | In mid-February love is always in the air, but is it in the groove? Salaam Remi—producer behind hits for Amy Winehouse, Miguel, Nas and more—joins TMS to debate the past, present, and future of the ballad. From Sinatra\'s stylings and Miles\'s blues, to Marvin\'s longings and Drake\'s feelings, the Snobs dive into the heart of the love song only to discover the soul of the slow jam. Before leaving, Salaam and the fellas nominate their pick for greatest break-up song of all time. Happy Valentine’s Day, y’all! Special Guest: Salaam Remi.', 'chan_desc': 'Snobbish taste.
