Casey and I talk through the history of Hot Rod Circuit and his current endeavors with country music and his band The Burning Angels. Casey recently released a 7” out with fellow friend Josh Berwanger on Lost Broadcast Records that’s worth checking out. If you ever wanted to know the ins and outs of what went down in the early 2000s, Hot Rod Circuit was right there. Casey weaves such a beautiful story through the eras, labels, and both hits and misses. I mostly sit back in this episode and let the master storyteller weave his tale.For more information: CaseyJamesPrestwood.com\xa0Support the show | We welcome back Dan Didier from The Promise Ring to talk about the album “Very Emergency.” Why do you ask? Because today, September 28th, 2019 is the 20th anniversary of this album’s release on Jade Tree Records!\xa0To that, I wanted to find a fun way to celebrate and talk about the album. So Dan and I connected earlier this week to discuss many things including the inspiration of the album artwork, the backlash at the time, the one video they did for the album, Kim Colleta’s honest opinion of the album and also her prowess for taping NBA games on VHS, and finally we read some reviews on the album from AV Club, MTV, and Pitchfork.\xa0If you haven’t, you should listen to this album now, get a feel for it and take an hour as Dan and I discuss, laugh, and then laugh some more about this album, time, and how many times we had to go to the internet to remember something.\xa0Support the show | Today we welcome Tim Kinsella. You may know Tim from such bands as Cap’n Jazz, Owls, Make Believe, and Joan of Arc. He’s currently playing music with his wife in Good Fuck. Tim and I spent time talking about his work ethic, the word emo, and the podcast interview starts with us discussing the recent Joan of Arc documentary and where they got the footage and stuff for it and Tim’s thoughts on saving things…\xa0Support the show | Today we welcome Jamie Stillman from EarthQuaker Devices, an effects pedal company out of Akron, Ohio. Jamie was also in bands you may have heard of like The Party of Helicopters, Fringe Candidate, Relaxer (his current band,) and my favorite, Harriet the Spy. Harriet the Spy was a band out of Kent, Ohio that was around from 1993-1998 and was an actual screamo band. They were one of the first screamo bands I ever heard when I started getting into all of this stuff. Also from 1993 to 2002, Jamie ran Donut Friends Records and put out a ton of punk, metal, and shoegaze acts. What’s even more fascinating than his band/label stories, or his time as a tour manager that you’ll hear about, is how Jamie started an effects pedal company. It’s a testament to pursuing what you love leads to your work. \xa0Support the show | Jade and I connected early on during the first album, "Real Stories Of True People Who Looked Kind Of Like Monsters." I was a huge fan and supporter. Following that debut, it was great to see the mainstream press take a liking to him after the amazing follow-up, "The Yunahon Mixtape." Now the album coming out August 16th, "Basking in the Glow," should propel him to another level. It’s that good. On the podcast, Jade and I discuss his early music life getting heckled, the new album, and there’s a good portion about the NBA, which we’re both huge fans of.\xa0Support the show | Today, we welcome Chris Crisci from The Appleseed Cast. Chris has been on my list for the entire 8 years of this podcast’s existence. I am honored to finally have him on the podcast. I loved Chris’ appreciation for the scene, constantly challenging himself, and not resting while making the band work alongside his day job, family and life. The band’s discography is one of my favorites in all of my music and to finally hear some of the questions I’ve had over the years was a true treat. Last, to note, there is a new album by the band entitled “The Fleeting Light of Impermanence” out of Graveface Records that we discuss. You can start listening to this on Friday, or if you’re listening to this in the future, it’s on your favorite streaming service. Chris was honest, sweet, and thoughtful throughout this beautiful conversation and I hope you enjoy.Support the show | A few months ago, I asked a couple of prior podcast guests Brian Lowit from Lovitt Records and now Dischord Records and John Davis from Q and Not U, if they thought an in-person interview could happen. Through their help and a little timing of a personal wedding in DC set this plan in motion.\xa0As this podcast gets into its 8th year with no signs of slowing down, I thought it was time to have the person partly responsible for why I first got into straightedge, punk, hardcore, and the DIY ethos I continue to carry through during my day job in the music industry at large.\xa0Ian couldn’t have been more gracious and after some back and forth and a nice Delta airlines agent, I was there with enough time to do the interview and make the wedding later that day.\xa0I never expected to have the opportunity to talk to one of my heroes in this setting and for Ian to spent a couple of hours showing me around the Dischord house, the archives and then an interview will be remembered forever.Support the show | Today we welcome Mitch Wilson from No Knife! Mitch and I have spoken to each other over the years and finally got some time to chat. We got deep into the San Diego scene, meeting Rocket from the Crypt and Drive like Jehu and early days of being on a label associated with a major. How No Knife met The Get Up Kids, their deep relationship with Lazycain and Jimmy Eat World. We find out that we both utilize a set of jokes that we use relentlessly to our friends and family. Finally, chat about his life as a dad and you’ll hear his son a couple of times in the podcast.\xa0Support the show | Today we welcome John Vanderslice. I found out about John through his album in 2000 called, Mass Suicide Occult Figurines, on Barsuk Records. It stuck with me and I’ve followed him since. Last month, he released his latest album “The Cedars” on Native Cat Recordings. He’s on tour with Pedro the Lion and worth a listen if you’ve never dived into the mind of Vanderslice.\xa0We talk about how he started late in music, how creating music takes some narcissism to survive, about the loss of life, and the depression that he’s been dealing with, including how this album saved his life. Plus, we dive into a discussion about having fame and critical acclaim early on in your career and what that does to you during and after. This is probably one of the more emotional as John opened up about his struggles with dependency on drugs and the battle he has every day with life, creating art, and keeping his recording studios, Tiny Telephone, afloat.

Fun fact: Dan Didier, drummer for the Promise Ring, Maritime and Vermont was the producer of the film!\xa0After seeing a screening of the film, I was fascinated at how much footage they had of Jawbreaker. I found out later from Dan that Adam was the one that has been saving everything. When I approached Adam to do the podcast a couple of years ago, Adam said we would need to wait as they were just about to announce all of the reunion shows.\xa0Recently in Brooklyn, Adam and I finally sat down to talk. We discuss where these archival/documentation thoughts started in his life and how the video store that he owned for years was feeding that same itch.\xa0We also discuss what it’s like being in Jawbreaker now and not being as neurotic about taking photos or saving the flyers. In the same light, Adam is fully realizing how important these things are later and the love for his band is how everyone should think about their own band’s legacy, big or small.\xa0Bonus, we talk about emo and how Adam didn’t hear them being called emo until after they broke up. Finally, a couple of rad Nirvana stories about Adam seeing them for the first time and knowing the first single was going to be “Smells Like Teen Spirit.”\xa0Support the show', 'chan_desc': 'Join Tom Mullen for a look back at when emo was an unknown word, its relevance now and speaks to those deeply involved with the emo/punk/hardcore/post-hardcore scene.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/5b/e5/60/5be56033-ea70-63ae-e6c9-12a7ebf1dcf5/mza_9104674520681473644.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2011-10-15'}}

During this week\'s conversation, we talk about all of the above, learn about Andy\'s work habits and hear about some of the daily decision-making that goes on behind-the-scenes at Taylor.\xa0 Support the Fretboard Journal and our podcasts during our first-ever Subscription Drive:\xa0https://www.fretboardjournal.com/support \xa0This episode is sponsored by\xa0Retrofret Vintage Guitars. | Support the Fretboard Journal and our podcasts during our first-ever Subscription Drive:\xa0https://www.fretboardjournal.com/support TJ Thompson is one of the most respected names in the world of vintage Martin guitars, a repairperson who can seemingly fix the impossible. Though he flies under the radar with no advertising and little publicity (aside from his occasional appearances in the Fretboard Journal), he has no shortage of work from collectors, high-end dealers and touring musicians. Occasionally, he even burns the midnight oil building Martin-inspired guitars under his own name. (As of this writing, he’s built 87 guitars from scratch.) \xa0 TJ returns to the FJ podcast in a conversation that covers a lot of ground: his background (the \'70s Martin D-35 with intonation issues that got him started in lutherie, his stints with Dana Bourgeois and Elderly Instruments); the inspiration that he finds from people and problem solving; and a few of the complicated guitar repairs he has recently tackled. Though there are plenty of guitar geek revelations, more than anything this is a chat about following your passion and finding mastery in your craft. Because of that, it’s one of our favorite episodes to date. \xa0 Note: TJ also appeared in the Fretboard Journal\xa0#26 and has been on Fretboard Journal Podcast episodes 55, 97, 122 and 123.

Stutman is a true authority when it comes to old Gibson and Martin guitar repairs and his restoration insights ("the enemy of Good is often Better") are invaluable for vintage guitar collectors.

We sit down to talk sobriety, beating the music school system, and rediscovering your identity after life\'s turbulent twist and turns. \xa0 The story of Jedd is one of redemption, tests, and second chances. Originally from\xa0Quorn, Australia, Jedd made the move to America to study music at\xa0Levelland Texas\'\xa0South Plains College. As fate would have it, there he met Terry McBride (of Terry McBride and The Ride) that took an interest in Jedd\'s talent. A talent of songwriting and musicianship based from artists like\xa0Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings––and his older brother loved Led Zeppelin and 90s grunge. Terry encouraged Jedd to move to Nashville and soon Jedd went with the sole goal to keep working so he could stay in America. Through connections and persistence, he landed an audition with Patty Loveless which inevitably put him in the circles of\xa0Rodney Crowell, Emmylou Harris, Buddy Miller, Vince Gill, Ryan Bingham, Sarah Jarosz, the late Guy Clark, Jim Lauderdale, Brandy Clark, and more. Many recognized Jedd\'s unique voice and MCA was quick to sign him to a recording contract, but again as fate would have it. The label was sold and as the pattern would have it. When a label is bought is sold, artists are dropped. Jedd was dropped just one month after his debut album, Transcontinental, in 2004. Still a fellow collaborator in the Nashville scene, Jedd was able to continue working as a session guitarist and you can hear him today on records by Dierks Bently, Rodney Crowell, Charles Kelly, Charlie Worsham, and more. But life still was turbulent. Now sober for 3 years, at this point alcohol and substance abuse was a way of coping and filling a void where the industry left a hole to be filled. After finding help and a new artistic direction Jedd finds life fulfilled with family and even new music.\xa0 \xa0 In our conversation, we tackle sobriety, mental health, and when life honestly gives you lemons. We even take a bit to understand what it takes to become an American citizen. Not to mention we take a look at Jedd\'s latest release, West. West is filled with cinematic landscapes that take you down a hole of despair, restlessness, and even redemptive points of the musical journey. The album is out now and can be streamed on all platforms.

All before the launch of his latest album, Home. Pre-order and stream the record on September 27th. \xa0 Billy Strings has already put a lot of his life in his songs. His music touches from substance abuse, poverty, and the characters that intertwine in life. Billy spent most of his time bouncing in-between Michigan and Kentucky, but he really found his community in Traverse City Michigan. There he was introduced to Don Julin, the writer of Mandolin For Dummies. Don really helped Billy cut his chops on performing daily and understanding how to make a career as a career musician. Since then, Billy is recognized as one of the premier guitarists in Bluegrass. Rubbing elbows and cutting records with the likes of Bela Fleck, Bryan Sutton, Sam Bush, and Del McCoury. Turmoil & Tinfoil, Billy\'s first record charted at No.3 on the Billboard Bluegrass and he\'s the rising star of the acoustic guitar.\xa0 \xa0 In our conversation, we talk about bouncing around from town to town in the early stages of his life. The introduction of drugs and substance abuse in home life. Then the turnaround in his life that made him not continue down that path. Discovering Bluegrass and the catalyst of jumping headfirst into the genre. We also tackle his writing style. This idea of classic bluegrass themes but changing the elements to make them relevant. Also his guitar playing. Pushing bluegrass guitar in a new direction that seemingly hasn\'t changed in decades. He helps me understand the power of psychedelics and DMT and getting in touch with the earth. Finally, we jump into Home.\xa0Billy\'s latest record, set to be released September 27th with 14 tracks that define the idea of what home is to Billy.\xa0 In this episode, you can get a sneak peek of the music from the album\xa0Home.

How\'d he do it? Selling contraband (bubble gum) at school funding his first camera. Then what does every film need? Music- which started Shannon\'s career in the music industry. His first big break was a role as a staff producer for Jermaine Dupri\'s So So Def Productions. He produced remixes for T.L.C., Usher, Jagged Edge, and Kut Klose. His time with So So Def gave Shannon the street credit and client base to form his own company, 11th Hour Entertainment with partner Doug Kaye. 11th Hour\'s first exclusive artist/production project was Bubba Sparxxx. In 2006, Houchins started his own label Average Joe\'s Entertainment Group with longtime friend and flagship artist, Colt Ford. Houchins has been an Artist, Producer, Label President and finally with his film credits. Hideout Pictures is becoming a staple in the film industry. Hideout Pictures and Shannon has credits from CMT\'s Still The King, Jay and Silent Bob: Reboot, animations, and projects all still in production as of 2019.

We talk about digital strategy and what\'s really popping in 2019. Social media marketing, crisis management, finding yourself as an artist, but most importantly we talk about mental health in the landscape of working in the industry.\xa0 \xa0 The history of Jade has a pattern of making it happen and passion. I also found that Jade has been pretty true to herself. A true fan, passionate about her work, and no stopping her. Early in her career, working in radio promotions, she met what would be her future clients. From there Warner Bros. came calling because of a revolutionary idea that Jade was already doing. Using social media as a tool for the music industry. In the time of Myspace\'s zenith, Jade and her team focused on capitalizing the platform to push their clients further in their careers. Soon Crowd Surf was born.\xa0Crowd Surf is a fan-centric marketing company, with offices in LA, Nashville and NYC, which specializes in entertainment marketing, artist management, digital strategy, content production, publicity and digital crisis management. Clients include\xa0Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, Why Don\'t We, Andy Grammar, AJR, NCT-127, Becky G, Loren Gray, Michael Buble, Max & Harvey, Jenna Raine and EBEN.\xa0 \xa0 In our conversation, we chat about our brands and how to utilize that on social media. In the digital age of social media, how do you go that next level at no matter your current status? Then there\'s the trap of comparisons but no matter what sticking to who you are. There can be mental health concerns.\xa0 Jade and I connect on when and how to get help.\xa0 \xa0 For more information about Crowd Surf visit\xa0http://crowdsurf.net/\xa0and subscribe to "How I Got Backstage" in your favorite podcast platform. | Outlaws, renegades, peyote trips, and new music with one of the fathers of Outlaw Country, Chris Gantry. Chris takes us through his life with Kris Kristofferson, Shel Silverstein, hit songs, and peyote trips. Chris\' latest project, Nashlantis is out now and available to stream everywhere.\xa0 \xa0 Chris Gantry is noted as being one of the founders of Outlaw Country. In a time where rhinestones and "flowers" were happening in country music. There was a crew of artists and writers that simply wanted to write about who they were. Hence the birth of Outlaw Country with notable writers like Chris; Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Shel Silverstein, etc. Originally from New York City and also working in the Brill Building, Chris made the journey to Nashville in the early 60\'s. A time of war, culture shifts, and even music shifts. In conversation, he mentions his first stop, who he met, and what the vibe of Nashville was like for the "outlaw" crew. We also tap into the accessibility of Nashville in the early recording days. Like walking in Chet Atkins office to learn a riff on the guitar. Not too much later Chris\' struck gold when he had a major cut from Glen Cambell from his tune, "Dreams of the Everyday Housewife". Other notable cuts include Johnny Cash\'s "Allegheny", Rhett Akins, and "Good Friends" with Reba Mcintire. \xa0 We walk through the history and climate of starting in the "outlaw" genre and his feelings toward music sounding the same. Even in today\'s radio country. Chris shares his outlook in writing (that includes a major award-winning play that he wrote). By staying fresh and always releasing material, it\'s obvious Chris is always moving forward. Nashlantis is no different. Continuing to push the limits for himself and experiencing the world around him. Nashlantis, is a look at Chris\' state of mind and coming to terms where he is in life. Nashlantis is out now on all platforms and can be streamed and bought from www.dragcity.com | Car crashes, talking hits, and learning life lessons with the songwriter of "Wild Thing", "Angel of the Morning", Chip Taylor and London based artist Belle Mt.. Chip is the creator of timeless hits spanning 5 decades and Belle Mt. shares the origin or his latest release "Origins".\xa0 \xa0 Belle Mt. (bell-mont) is songwriter Matt Belmont that just released the video for "Origins" but also it\'s the first single of 2019 (produced by Grammy award-winning producer Femke Weidema). This London-based artist uses life-altering moments to create a new story and "Origins" is no different.\xa0 We get into the nuances of the new track and video; pride, a crash, and relationships. We also figure out the faults of keeping scores in life\'s relationships. Visit www.bellemt.com to check out the video and see tour dates, and follow him @bellemtmusic. \xa0 Chip Taylor (James Wesley\xa0Voight)\xa0will probably always be known as the songwriter who wrote "Wild Thing" and "Angel of the Morning." But there\'s so much more to the man besides 2 songs. Other notable tracks include\xa0"He Sits at Your Table" (Willie Nelson), "I Can\'t Let Go" (Evie Sands,\xa0the Hollies,\xa0Linda Ronstadt), "The Baby" (the Hollies), "Any Way That You Want Me" (the Troggs,\xa0Evie Sands, Melanie, Juice Newton,\xa0Lita Ford, Liverpool Five), "Just a Little Bit Harder" (Lorraine Ellison,\xa0Janis Joplin),\xa0"Sweet Dream Woman" (Waylon Jennings), "A Little Bit Later On Down the Line" (Bobby Bare), "Rock Soldiers" (Ace Frehley), and "Son of a Rotten Gambler" (Emmylou Harris,\xa0the Hollies,\xa0Anne Murray). A new generation is getting to know Chip by his track on Netflix\'s Sex Education, "F*** All The Perfect People" as well. \xa0 Chip, a Songwriter Hall of Fame Inductee, also has a love for country music and even built a healthy career in the 70\'s in the genre. We talk about all these but we also go into his other passions and careers (A notable gamble and golfer). But more importantly, we get to understand how Chip ticks and we tackle the ups and downs of his career. One would think that your way is paved with a track record like his, but you even learn through his latest record (Whiskey Salesman) the life lessons learned from this vet.\xa0Whiskey Salesman is out now under Train Wreck Records and you can follow Chip @chiptaylorofficial | Sam Bush takes us deeper into his side of the history of bluegrass, the state of the genre, and as we reflect on past projects. Sam came in to promote his latest music, "Stop The Violence", as well as setting the record straight on some of the details of his story.\xa0 \xa0 If you\'ve seen the documentary Revival: The Sam Bush Story. You\'ve gotten a taste and understand the life of Sam. In this episode, we actually go beyond the movie and tap into what happened in some of the pivotal moments of Sam\'s life. His relationship with Lonnie Wilson, life after The Bluegrass Alliance, the conception of The New Grass Revival in the Capitol Record years, and willing to walk away from what could have been great opportunities to embrace who Sam has become.\xa0 \xa0 Sam is what most people have dubbed the Father of New Grass, a progressive style of bluegrass. Armed with numerous awards and accolades to justify his status in music, Sam is a champion of art while most have discredited the genre. We take time to discuss his role and thoughts on the future of bluegrass/instrumental music and take a look at his recent plea to stop the violence with his new music. | Life in a box, sobriety, and reflecting on being famous and if that is success with Smithfield and Griffin House. Jenn and Trey of Smithfield come to talk about their newest EP, We Make Our Own and the past year of their radio tour life. Then Griffin talks about his music, movie, and his latest record Rising Star. \xa0 SmithField was founded in 2011 of\xa0Trey Smith and Jennifer Fielder. Spending most of their journey as an independent duo, they began hitting their stride after releasing, "Hey Whiskey". A highly regarded single from the duo that was released after their stint with a major label. Armed with time and lessons learned on their own, SmithField is now an indie duo learning the country radio game and developing their sound. We take the time to talk about the game of radio at their level, discovering and developing their sound, and breaking all expectations from fans and the business. Visit\xa0www.smithfieldmusic.com\xa0and follow them @smithfieldmusic. \xa0 Griffin House is an artist veteran having releasing his 13th studio record, Rising Star. We dive into Griffin\'s music and a lot of his new stuff. But I would think more importantly we take a look at sobriety and what success looks like these days for Griffin. A large part of what his up-coming movie about, we take a look at the success of our mutual, and not so mutual, friends and compare them to us. Perhaps a natural thought process, but for Griffin we get to the heart of the issue. That includes sobriety, family, and time. Time is a funny thing.\xa0His 2004 debut album Lost and Found was lauded as one of the “best emerging songwriters.” He began touring, opening for acts like John Mellencamp and The Cranberries, and found himself meeting people like Bruce Springsteen and Willie Nelson. By all accounts, House seemed poised to be more of an “overnight success” rather than a ”rising star”… but that’s not exactly how things turned out. “I’ve been a “rising star” for the past 15 years.

Jordan Davis takes us back to his home state of Louisiana and reflects on the past year on the release of his highly acclaimed breakout record, Home State. But first, Tyler Dial jumps in to talk about his latest single release, "About Last Night" and social media etiquette. \xa0 \xa0Jordan Davis is a Shreveport-born, Nashville songwriter. Armed with two back-to-back #1 songs (“Singles You Up” and “Take It From Me”) from his debut album Home State. Jordan is following up with his latest release, “Slow Dance In A Parking Lot”. With over 330 million streams, holding the record for the most weeks on Pandora’s New Country Top 10 chart for a debut single, and wrapping up opening for Rascal Flatts and Old Dominion in 2019. Jordan may be most excited about becoming a father. We tap into that but we also start at the beginning in our conversation. Coming from a rich musical family (his uncle penning Tracy Lawrence’s hits, “Today’s Lonely Fool” and “Better Man, Better Off” and his brother also a songwriter in Nashville, TN), Jordan never got a free pass in the music city. With the help of his brother, right place in the right time connections, a fork in the road, and a little perseverance. Jordan was able to sign his label deal with Universal Music Group Nashville within 5 years from moving to Nashville. We tackle head games and making comparisons, but more importantly how he was able to get over the thief of joy. For everything about Jordan visit www.jordandavisofficial.com, and follow him @jordandavisofficial on social platforms. \xa0 Arizona born, Texas schooled, Nashville songwriter Tyler Dial starts this episode promoting his latest release “About Last Night”. I first met Tyler years ago when he was still attending Texas University and starting his music career. What started off as a casual slide in a DM has now become a first time meet in person. Not really the new kid in town, Tyler has worked with songwriters/producers Ryan Tyndell, Ryan Beaver, Jeremy Spillman, Ben Hayslip, Lucie Silvas, Devin Dawson, Andy Albert, Kyle Fishman, and more on his Repaint EP. Since then things have progressed to the present with the latest releases.

Then Clare shares thoughts on cancer, living in Australia, the LGBTQ community, her TV experience, and releasing her self titled debut album.\xa0 \xa0 Having won numerous songwriting awards, it\'s safe to say Caroline Spence is a songwriting wizard. Caroline and I share a fellow songwriting acquaintance and then soon we\'re off diving into her latest release, Mint Condition. As we\'re taping into the specifics of words and the power a pronoun we begin to understand the landscape of the project. Having gone through some of our favorite instances in the album, we get on the topic of living inside your head as a creative. Is this the catalyst of anxiety? If we didn\'t work in our heads would we feel may be more "normal"? What most people might see as a personal flaw, we should embrace though. By sharing the heart of your self and inner feelings in a song, we discover is our greatest gift to the world. Visit\xa0http://www.carolinespencemusic.com\xa0for everything and follow her @carolinespence_. \xa0 Some might know Clare Bowen after the success of ABC\'s Nashville as the character Scarlett O\'Connor, but that shouldn\'t slow her down as an artist in her own right. The Australian actress that we might know sits down to talk about her battle with cancer at a very young age, sharing insight into the creation of her latest record, and we talk about the music from her self titled debut. Produced by Josh Kaufman (The National, Bob Weir), Clare Bowen\'s album also features Buddy Miller and songwriters Lori McKenna, Brandon Robert Young, Nathan Chapman, Stephanie Lambring, and Caroline Spence. An album 5 years in the making, because of production schedules, is an introduction to who Clare Bowen is personally. Clare also is an advocate of many things. She shares the origin of taking up arms with the LBGTQ community and her passion for food. Not to mention we tackle loneliness. The idea of capturing your thoughts and feelings like loneliness and sharing it with the world can be really vulnerable. But once it\'s out, you begin to realize that you\'re not lonely at all. Her album is out now on all platforms, and you can also visit\xa0www.clarebowenofficial.com\xa0for tour dates and updates.

The funniest part of the conversation is near the end, where Tweedy tells stories about weird interactions with fans.As fans know, Tweedy wrote a memoir, “Let’s Go (So We Can Get Back),” that came out in 2018, and Wilco’s 11th album, “Ode to Joy,” is scheduled for release on October 4.More about Wilco is at wilcoworld.net.For more info please visit our [website.](https://www.thetapesarchive.com/)The Tapes Archive is part of the Osiris network. For more podcasts and experiences, please visit [Osiris](https://www.osirispod.com). | I interviewed Neil Peart several times over the years and thoroughly enjoyed every conversation. In addition to being a great drummer, he’s a smart, thoughtful, articulate gentleman whose worldview extends well beyond rock ‘n’ roll.This interview, recorded in 1990, was the first of our talks. Nearly 30 years later, I’m still amazed by his interest in visiting art museums and bicycling around the United States, his desire to become a prose writer, and his simple explanation for why Rush had been able to stay together for so long. (“We’ve retained not only respect but also affection for each other over the years.”) When we talked, Rush was touring behind Presto, its 13th studio album, so there’s also a lot of conversation about songs on that album. A bit of context:-Early on, we talk about—but don’t name—Rush’s first drummer. He was John Howard Rutsey, who left the group in 1974. He died in 2008.-We also discuss the Meech Lake Accord, which would have recognized Quebec as a \'\'distinct society\'\' in the body of the Canadian constitution. The accord ultimately failed.For more about Rush, visit rush.com/band/, where the group’s credentials are laid out nicely: “More than 40 million records sold worldwide. Countless sold-out tours. A star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Officers of the Order of Canada. And that\'s all very nice. But for these three guys, it\'s all about the music, their friendship, and the fans.”For more info please visit our website.The Tapes Archive is part of the Osiris network.

You’ve gotta like someone who says, “A lot of things I had done over the years, I can\'t remember if I did \'em or not. But they sort of sound great."I think you’ll enjoy this interview.As for the concert, it was OK. My review started like this:"This is not a concert tonight; this is a reunion," Rick James announced early in his set Friday night at the Indiana Convention Center. Actually, it was both a concert and a reunion, as well as a throwback to an era when performers favored sexual innuendo (rather than outright vulgarity) and identified people by their Zodiac signs. James led his Stone City Band through an imbalanced, sporadically invigorating set in his return to action after two years in prison on a drug and assault conviction, plus years of inactivity due to drug addiction.For more info please visit our website.The Tapes Archive is part of the Osiris network.

We\'re looking back to 1970, An Evening with The Grateful Dead wherein they bring out acoustic guitars and special guests to make some beautiful music. It\'s not all mellow vibes, though. The second set gets very electric and we\'ve included some potent jams to wrap this whole thing up.This episode was partially inspired by the impending Autumn cool down and more than slightly inspired by the recent Dead To Me podcast episode on American Beauty. This show was performed just after completion of the American Beauty recording sessions and you can hear it in the playing.Speaking of the Dead To Me podcast, they are going through each Grateful Dead studio album over the course of their current season, including a \'setbreak\' episode featuring your host as a guest to discuss some critical Side Project albums. You can hear that and their entire season on their website: https://www.deadtomepod.com/ or in your favorite podcast app.Dead To Me, just like the Brokedown Podcast, is part of the Osiris Podcast Network.

In this episode I chat with the extremely talented guitar player, Tashi Dorji. Dorji is a full-time practitioner of improvisational guitar. We get into his background, from piecing together Western music in his homeland of Bhutan and acquiring his first guitar, to coming to the States, joining a band, and discovering jazz. Dorji has a new album coming out on September 3 on Moone Records. "Midden" is a collaboration with John Dieterich (Deerhoof) and features two side-long improvisations from the two guitarists.After the interview, we listen to a clip from the album which you can find on Bandcamp at moonerecords.bandcamp.com or at https://moonerecords.com. You can find more great, experimental, music from Tashi Dorji at his bandcamp page: tashidorji1.bandcamp.com.After that we look back 45 years to September, 1974 for a little taste of Grateful Dead in Munich, West Germany.As always, allow me to remind you that the Brokedown Podcast is part of the Osiris Podcast Network.

This time around we are joined by drummer, Ryan Jewell, who has graced a number of terrific albums over recent years. We talk about his work, his recent and upcoming releases and, of course, The Grateful Dead.Also in this episode, we say farewell to Garcia/Saunders drummer, Bill Vitt who passed away earlier this month.Ryan Jewell has a lot to say and some great music coming out. Early in July, he released a record as the Ryan Jewell Quintet entitled "Vibration!". Somewhere between post-bop, free jazz, and the modern era, this collection of Ryan\'s compositions pushes and pulls at its boundaries, entertaining all the while. You can find that at https://ryanjewellquintet.bandcamp.com/.Not content to do any one thing, his next release is under the name Mosses and is entitled, "T.V. Sun". This is more an experimental indie group which covers a lot of ground. Ryan plays dulcimer, guitar, synthesizers, and (of course) drums on this release. He tells us all about it and we get listen to a track after the interview. "T.V. Sun" is out on September 20.

Quicksilver was closely entwined with the Grateful Dead in the Bay Area 60\'s scene, of course, but we focus on Quicksilver\'s story and get into some live tunes from 1967. After that we jump forward to one of Gary Duncan\'s appearances with the Dead in the 90s.First off, though, we spend a couple minutes talking about the upcoming album from Episode 30 guests, One Eleven Heavy. Their new album is called Desire Path and comes out on September 20 via Beyond Beyond is Beyond.Quicksilver Messenger Service\'s hey day may be past but there are still great tapes and the band has been cleaning them up and putting them out.

This time we talk to four different artists: Andy McLeod, Joseph Allred, Eli Winter, and Jon Camp; about their new records and about their place in and perception of the so-called "American Primitive" school of guitar. We share some of their tunes and then, of course, we spin some good old Grateful Dead.So much new music is covered in this episode, it\'s a little dizzying. In addition to the great guests, I mentioned the Phil & Friends shows from The Cap that you absolutely should check out. There\'s also the new Prana Crafter/Tarotplane split LP available here, the Dire Wolves record that you can find here and Jeffery Alexander\'s solo album that\'s available here.Andy McLeod\'s releases can be found at his bandcamp: https://andymcleod.bandcamp.comJoseph Allred\'s "Nightsongs can be found via bandcamp: https://gardenportal.bandcamp.com/album/nightsongs and his upcoming album "O Meadowlark" can be purchased via Feeding Tube Records.Eli Winter\'s album, "The Time To Come" can be purchased via bandcamp: https://eliwinter.bandcamp.comJon Camp\'s releases are available via his bandcamp: https://joncamp.bandcamp.comThe Brokedown Podcast is part of the Osiris Podcast Network.

This is one of the finest festivals in the land. Everything from the music, to the location, to the crowds in attendance, is just right. We\'re going to listen to some of the music from the weekend, some interviews that I conducted while I was there, and while this episode is certainly bluegrass-centric, we\'re still going to get a healthy dose of Grateful Dead...Sort of.We\'re going to hear from Billy Strings, Yonder Mountain String Band, The Larry Keel Experience, The Travelin\' McCourys, Railroad Earth, and The Del McCoury Band. That\'s just a small sampling of the great music that I saw. I try to run most of them down in the show.After all the DelFest talk, I thought you might like to hear a little Jerry Garcia. In keeping with a popular discussion point from the weekend and the bluegrass festival thing, we\'ll be checking out a short set of Old And In The Way from the Marin County Bluegrass Festival in 1974.sat down to interview those artists and more for the new Osiris series \'InnerViews\'.

But a handful of times each summer, we get the rock star treatment at the Hollywood Bowl!OK, so those 18,000 folks probably aren\'t screaming just for the two of us... there might be some famous movie tunes thrown in, or some fireworks, or Katy Perry. But we take it all in stride as we navigate the summer home of the LA Philharmonic.Listen up for the inside scoop on one of the most amazing performing arts venues anywhere in the world! | Maybe it\'s the proverbial "seven minutes to midnight", or maybe you\'ve still got a week or two. It never feels like enough time, trust us.So here\'s some advice for those last few days, hours, and minutes before your big day, inspired by the recent violin auditions at the LA Philharmonic. | First, some exciting news: we\'ve got Stand Partners for Life T-shirts! Check them out here, and show your Stand Partner love!For this episode, Akiko and I just had a one-word outline: Mahler! And it turns out we had plenty to say about his symphonies. What\'s it like to learn them, refine them, rehearse them, take them on tour? What do committees look for when you play Mahler?Hear about the time Akiko was mortified to play Mahler 9 with David Hyde Pierce (Frasier\'s Niles Crane) in the front row! Or the time Nathan got a death stare from Daniel Barenboim during... well, also during Mahler 9!And as to Nathan\'s comment that Gustav Mahler was perhaps the New York Philharmonic\'s first music director? He was actually its ninth! Nathan was under the misapprehension that the NY Phil began around the same time as so many other American orchestras, in the early part of the 20th century... in fact, New York got its start in 1848, whereas Mahler wasn\'t born until 1860! Mahler spent the last two years of his life, 1909-1911, at the helm of the Philharmonic. |  |  |  | Here at Stand Partners for Life, we get a lot of questions about the future: what happens if I\'m not playing concerto X by age Y? What will happen if I study with teacher Z, or go to school-- I ran out of letters!So even though we can\'t give definitive answers to these questions, they\'re still great questions! And one listener email in particular sparked a discussion about success at an early age, the importance (or non-importance) of conservatory for winning an orchestra audition, and lots more.Along the way, we also answer listener questions about sight reading in high positions, as well as "contextual intonation": changing your pitch based on what\'s going on around you, especially in the orchestra!And we start out by talking Twelve-Tone: Nathan\'s upcoming performance of Arnold Schoenberg\'s fourth String Quartet, and whether or not it\'s "real music". Daniel Barenboim considered him one of the most important composers in history. Does "most important" equal best? | If it seems like we\'ve been silent the last couple of months, that\'s because Akiko\'s life has been pretty different since early March! One moment she was working out at the gym like she did five times a week, and the next she was flat on her back with paramedics on the way.Suffice it to say that she hasn\'t been playing with the LA Phil since then, but we can see the way back at least! Midway through her recovery, we talk about her time in the hospital and back at home.We also take the opportunity to answer some fantastic questions that you emailed during our time away, including what audition recordings are all about, whether we\'d fake Prokofiev\'s Cinderella suite, and how we deal with audience distractions!TranscriptNathan Cole:        Hi, and welcome back to Stand Partners for Life.Nathan Cole:        And this time, after a bit of a long break… we took a long break last summer. This one was a little different. Akiko, do you want to tell us why?Akiko Tarumoto:     I have been recuperating from an unfortunate incident at the gym. I took a bad step, fell on my bottom, and spent the next eight weeks recovering.Nathan Cole:        Eight weeks and counting.Akiko Tarumoto:     Seven weeks and counting.Nathan Cole:        Oh, okay. And not working, not playing in the Philharmonic.Akiko Tarumoto:     Not playing. I\'m playing but not playing at work.Nathan Cole:        Take us back to the incident a little bit.Akiko Tarumoto:     People keep kind of guessing what it was, and they\'ll be like, "Oh, were you…?" I don\'t know why it bothered me at the hospital. The doctors kept talking about how I was doing step aerobics, and I was like-Nathan Cole:        That makes you sound like a-Akiko Tarumoto:     I didn\'t take a time machine back to the \'80s and don skintight, shiny spandex…Nathan Cole:        "And one, and two…"Akiko Tarumoto:     Yeah, no. So I was not doing step aerobics. It did involve a box, one of those foam boxes. They come in various heights, and this one was the lowest one. It was a 12-inch box, and I was just trying to do something to keep my heart rate up between weight lifting rounds. And yeah, just, it was one of those weird things that just, I guess I was kind of tired, and my foot didn\'t come cleanly down from the box. My other foot was already on the way up. So the box slid toward me, and I landed. I had nowhere to go but on my bottom.Nathan Cole:        And I\'ve had other people ask me, people who don\'t know you very well -- But just to make it clear, I mean, you were probably at the gym or were, at that time, five times a week, doing these kinds of classes.Akiko Tarumoto:     Yeah, yeah. In fact, I was joking that I should probably spend as much time playing the violin as I did at the gym. Because at that point, just working out, and running… if you added up all the time I spent exercise-wise, it, yeah, dwarfed my actual time practicing on my instrument. So yeah, it was a little bit sobering. So now, finally, my practicing found a way to reverse that proportion.Nathan Cole:        Against your will.

Did you realize that he hosts a show called\xa0Friday Night Freak Out\xa0on Little Stevie’s Underground Garage Sirius XM radio station? He does, and it gets wonderfully weird. Drew sat down with legendary Philly musician\xa0—\xa0and fellow Underground Garage DJ\xa0—\xa0Palmyra Delran (The Friggs, The Coolies) for a fun trip down the musical rabbit hole. The two chop it up on Drew’s history playing in polka bands; the culture clash that occurred when Palmyra hired a classical cellist for a session; meeting Dick Clark, Brian Wilson, and a couple of Beatles; and so much more.

This week we revisit one of our favorite conversations recorded out at last year\'s Life is Beautiful festival. Subscribe today to keep up to date with future Talkhouse Podcasts. In September, the Talkhouse Podcast squad rolled out to Las Vegas for Life is Beautiful Music and Arts Festival. In between performances from Talkhouse faves A$AP Ferg, CHVRCHES, and Death Cab For Cutie, we recorded some epic convos for the show. Comedian Jaboukie Young-White (The Daily Show, American Vandal) and indiepop legends The Drums’ Jonny Pierce are whip-smart queer artists who have intricately bound together their work and sexuality. Backstage at the fest, they and newer Drums\' member Bryan de Leon dissected what exactly it means to be a "queer artist." Their talk takes in coming out through one’s art, "conveniently Christian homophobes," Balenciaga daddies, and how the world needs a gay Shrek. Oh, and Bryan also got Jaboukie to give some inside scoop on American Vandal season two... Check it out, and subscribe now to stay in the loop on future episodes of the Talkhouse Podcast.

Big thanks to Life Is Beautiful for hosting the Talkhouse Podcast. | Alison Mosshart (The Kills, The Dead Weather) has been painting with remote control cars; Devendra Banhart\'s been obsessively pondering Christian Slater\'s \'89 skater flick Gleaming The Cube. To celebrate Alison\'s new art book about cars — Car Ma — and Devendra\'s LP Ma, the two got together over salted egg brainless shrimp heads to discuss the above as well as skateboarding as a gateway drug to dope music, the multi-hyphenate magic of Captain Beefheart, how Guns N\' Roses\' November Rain video shaped Devendra\'s idea of Americans, and so much more. Check it out! Today’s show was recorded by Michael Harris at Electro-Vox Studios in Los Angeles, and Mark Yoshizumi at Hook and Fade Studios in Brooklyn. It was co-produced by Mark Yoshizumi. The Talkhouse Podcast’s theme song was composed and performed by The Range. | Brian Wilson and The Zombies are touring together!!! I repeat, head Beach Boy Brian Wilson and recent Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees The Zombies are touring America together right now! To celebrate these legendary artists sharing the stage, we got \'em together at the first gig of the run for a Talkhouse Podcast conversation. The Zombies’ songwriter/keyboardist Rod Argent and singer Colin Blunstone roundtable some wonderful ideas with Wilson, fellow Beach Boys founder Al Jardine, 1970s Beach Boys addition Blondie Chaplin (who also plays with The Rolling Stones), and Darian Sahanaja, who’s played with Brian for two decades and was key in the making of the fantastic Smile LP. Their talk takes in the early days of The Beach Boys and The Zombies, and the bands\' love of each other\'s music; challenges in playing songs you haven’t played in 50 years; recording Friends in Brian’s living room; and "balls out" Hammond B3 organ that\'d make Argent proud. Check it out, and stay tuned after the featured conversation for clips of our favorite Brian Wilson and Zombies appearances on the show from 2016, including Brian and Carly Rae Jepsen in a "one-question wonder" chat from Pitchfork Music Festival, and The Zombies chatting with Hollis Brown at the Samsung store in NYC.

It was co-produced by Mark Yoshizumi. The Talkhouse Podcast’s theme song was composed and performed by The Range. | As I learned from today\'s episode, comedian Chris Gethard and singer-songwriter Mal Blum are "self-deprecating sad boys from Jersey" who are attracted to “erratic or controlling people who will blow your life up.” What I already knew going in is that the two are old friends, occasional collaborators, and incredibly talented at their art. Gethard and Blum joined us on the Talkhouse Podcast to celebrate the release of Blum\'s excellent new LP Pity Boy, and their conversation is predictably openhearted, neurotic, and fucking hilarious. Tune in to hear them consider going to a Love Addicts 12-step meeting, share their writing processes (Gethard even opens up his joke notebook and shares some new ideas!), unpack Mal\'s lack of boundaries, and learn why Gethard wants to wind up his career. Today’s episode was co-produced and recorded by Mark Yoshizumi. It was cut at Hook and Fade Studios in Brooklyn. Research assistance was provided by Madalyn Feltus. The Talkhouse Podcast’s theme song was composed and performed by The Range. With this week\'s episode, Chris Gethard has joined the (sort of) rare and (moderately) coveted Talkhouse Podcast Hat Trick Club! Check out his previous appearances, talking with Todd Barry and Tim Heidecker. | Our latest installment of the Talkhouse Podcast at FORM Fest 2019 is a love letter to Chicago\'s post-rock, punk and emo scenes from the \'00s to today. Windy City music legends — and old friends — Trevor de Brauw (Pelican, RLYR, TUSK) and Nate Kinsella (American Football, Joan of Arc, Make Believe) caught up backstage for a warm and hilarious convo, as well as a rad improvised ambient musical collaboration. The guys\' talk takes in a lot: playing in bands with family members; having your musician father hate on your experimental work; and balancing parenthood and tour life. Oh and, of course: tone clusters, alternate tunings, death metal, and odd time signatures. This Talkhouse Podcast episode was recorded in the Conservatory backstage at FORM Fest in Arcosanti, Arizona. Pulp Arts and Patreon teamed up to co-present The Conservatory, a dope backstage visual arts installation and recording studio. Talkhouse recorded six episodes there throughout the weekend. You can also check out the other episodes in this series, including Snail Mail with Fred Armisen & Mary Lynn Rajskub, Robert Glasper & Vieux Farka Touré with special guest Lonnie Holley, Julianna Barwick & Mary Lattimore, and Kelsey Lu with Yrsa Daley-Ward. —Elia Einhorn, Talkhouse Podcast host and producer @eliaeinhorn Today’s episode was co-produced by Mark Yoshizumi. It was recorded at FORM Festival in Arcosanti, Arizona, and at Hook and Fade Studios in Brooklyn by Mark Yoshizumi, Danny Clifton, and Ian Jones. Research assistance was provided by Madalyn Feltus.

The Talkhouse Podcast’s theme song was composed and performed by The Range. | On the latest episode of the Talkhouse Podcast, Lulu Wang — writer-director of the summer indie hit The Farewell — chats with one of her favorite directors, Ruben Östlund, the award-winning Swedish director of such acclaimed films as The Square and Force Majeure. Talking from New York City and Gothenburg, respectively, the two filmmakers have a profound and highly entertaining conversation that touches on everything from the crucial role cinema plays in society and the importance of making films from lived experience, to how the internet turns us into shitty people and what Lulu and her boyfriend Barry Jenkins watch when they just want to relax. Special thanks to Katey Rich from Vanity Fair for collaborating on this special conversation, and for joining us on the podcast.

Over the years, this series has featured talks between Brian Wilson & Carly Rae Jepsen, Kamasi Washington & Thundercat, HAIM and Chvrches, and many more. This week\'s show features two young Chicago singer-songwriters who are both blowing up fast: Tasha and Lala Lala\'s Lillie West. The two chopped it up on how much they\'re learning all the time as their careers explode (including adjusting to having teams working around them); dealing with impostor syndrome; and the perils of making jokes onstage. Their talk also took in Jack White\'s technophobia, the pluses and minuses of freeing the nipple onstage, and Marie Kondo-ing your Instagram.

Quotes:   “My idea of success as I defined it as I was 18 was ‘I will know I am successful when I am making my living as a composer’ and that’s shifted over the years as I mentioned before. I have eight piano students. I’m happy to have them. I’m happy to have a source of steady income.”   “I love having the morning to do business things and the afternoon to do creative things. Again, that’s what works for me. I know everyone’s different. But once you find your own personal creative rhythm you should do everything in your power to make that possible and to create and carve out that space for yourself.”   “That particular essay is also about not getting so attached to particular performers. Like, ‘oh if this one chorus just did my music I would feel like I made it. I’d feel like I was finally successful. I’d get a ton more commissions as a result. That might be true, but looking at my career, and looking at my friends’ careers too, it is very rare that one single performance has that kind of effect.”   “Feeling like you have any obligation to put anything on your website is a recipe for disaster I think. It’s up to you completely how you structure your website and what you put on it and why.”   "You do all this research and it might take five minutes. You don\'t have to dig deep into the history of what this ensemble has done. But you get a really good feeling for the kind of music that they do and then you look at your own catalog and you see what music you have that would be a good fit for them. An actual, real good fit. And then you say something like \'I think this piece would be a really good fit for you because I\'ve noticed that you loved doing this piece\' or \'you did a really beautiful performance of this piece and so I thought you might enjoy my piece."   "I\'ve found too that just labeling things when they come up is so helpful. Recognizing that something is a pattern and that it comes up every time and knowing that you can be like \'Oh, this is the day where I hate everything I\'ve written and tomorrow or two days later it\'s gonna be fine again.\' That helps you move through it, again, without attaching any additional stress or anxiety to that moment."   "It\'s okay if things take time and they will take time. And if you set a very, very narrow, specific goal for yourself you\'re not very likely to succeed."

The quartet is known for improvisational "jamming" within their original songs which some reviewers and fans have compared to The Black Crowes, Grateful Dead, Phish, and The Allman Brothers Band.

After over two decades of making pure Americana Music, their body of work is well known. They’ve won awards for their six studio records and they have been mainstays on tours and festival lineups. This veteran outfit has played all the big rooms and virtually everyone I know knows the song Wagon Wheel. So with the announcement that they were releasing a live record, fittingly one whose tracks were recorded at The Ryman, I knew I had to get someone to talk with us. So we sat down with mandolin player Cory Younts to get the low down on the new record and well, lots more.

Today that EP is available everywhere you listen to music.\xa0Like me, fans on-line got very excited about the new tunes and were anxious to share their thoughts on them. We've always had a great relationship with the band, so we decided to get in touch with Brian Moss, the band's guitar player, and one of their vocalists to discuss The Gaff Tapes and the band's plans for their upcoming fall and winter tour. Our conversation started, when I asked Brian why the quartet decided to put out this EP now.\xa0For more information on The Gaff Tapes and their tour schedule visit Spafford.net.Show Notes: \xa0First Song:\xa000:14 - Be StrangeInterview Begins: 05:55Extro Song: 27:34 - Comfortable | The New Mastersounds are a Funk/Soul/Blues/Rock outfit that blend all of those sounds and more into a really brilliant mix that you have to hear.

Colonel & the Mermaids is Alex's chance to create his own music, shape his own band's future and create his own future in the industry and community. That is no small task, but as you'll hear, it's one that he isn't taking lightly and one that he is prepared to invest a lot of time, energy and money. We sat down with Alex who is about to come east for a small tour and our conversation started when I asked what the sonic aim of the band is.\xa0If the effort, and indeed the music is any indication, I suspect we will be hearing from Colonel & the Mermaids for quite some time.

What probably isn’t obvious based on his most recent works, is that he hasn’t always been the singer-songwriter he is now. His new record Let it Slide drops September 20th, and as you’ll hear his focus has always been more on instrumental music, but this record is filled hot dance piano rock, and he sings on almost every track. Another great feature of this record, besides the pop-py tones and throw back sounds is the role Marco Benevento's bassist Karina Rykman plays as a vocalist. It’s all good fun and certainly a departure from previous work. We dig Marco a lot, so we dialed him up and our conversation started when I asked specifically about his new role as singer in the band...For more information on Let it Slide and to check tour dates visit, marcobenevento.com.\xa0Show Notes: \xa0First Song:\xa000:14 - Let It SlideInterview Begins: 03:05Extro Song: 22:51 - Send It On A Rocket", 'chan_desc': 'The\xa0Sound Podcast is a music discovery interview style podcast, hosted by Ira Haberman.

Since 1980, Clarke’s recording history would be called diverse. Clarke has worked with such artists as Paul McCartney, Joey DeFrancesco, Glen Campbell, Ike Turner, Deepak Chopra, Dr. Billy Taylor, Hal Blaine, David Grisman, Jimmy Smith, The Phoenix Boys Choir, The Four Tops, Bobby Hutcherson, Don Edwards, James Moody, Rex Allen, Waylon Jennings, Frank Gambale, Alice Cooper, James Galway, Boston Brass, Brownie McGee, Tower of Power, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra, Joe Alessi, Phil Smith (New York Philharmonic), Mark O’Connor, Peter Erskine, El Chicano, Honey Boy Edwards, UNM Wind Ensemble, Pro Musica Chamber Orchestra, Eric Burdon, Snuff Garrett, Lee Hazlewood, R.

With new revelations from former wives and lovers, family members, fellow band members and celebrities, and music industry figures, this book offers an updated, unfettered look at Reed’s creative process, his mental health problems, his bisexuality, his three marriages, and his addictions to drugs and alcohol.Featuring previously unpublished photographs of some of Reed’s most private moments, this is the definitive account of one of rock ’n’ roll’s most complicated and brilliant prophets.Howard Sounes is known for writing detailed and revelatory biographies of a wide range of extraordinary personalities, including the murderers Fred and Rosemary West (Fred & Rose), Charles Bukowski (Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life), and musicians Bob Dylan (Down the Highway) and Paul McCartney (Fab). Each book is based on extensive original research.

A deep dig into why consumers have to live with poor digital audio and how Neil’s crusade to change that is working!Neil Young took on the music industry so that fans could hear his music - all music - the way it was meant to be heard.Today, most of the music fans listen to is streamed via online services and highly compressed. It\'s convenient, but, frustratingly, this comes at the cost of quality. Gone are the days when it was technologically necessary to compress music into the smallest possible file size, yet this remains the industry standard.The result is music that is robbed of its original quality - muddy and flat in sound compared to the rich, warm sound artists hear in the studio. It doesn\'t have to be this way, but the record and technology companies have incorrectly assumed that most listeners are satisfied with these low-quality tracks.Neil Young is challenging the assault on audio quality - and working to free music lovers from the flat and lifeless status quo.To Feel the Music is the true story of Neil\'s quest to bring high-quality audio back to music lovers - which he considers the most important undertaking of his career. Inside, follow Neil as he discovers the step by step deterioration of recorded sound as analog is methodically replaced by digital CDs, MP3s, and low-price, low-quality streaming; gathers others committed to his goal of delivering music the way artists intend for it to sound; and eventually develops the Neil Young Archives, a high-res streaming site that gives users unprecedented access to all of Neil\'s music - in the best quality their devices can handle - videos, photos, and more.Neil\'s efforts to bring quality audio to his fans garnered media attention when his Kickstarter campaign for his Pono player - a revolutionary music player that would combine the highest quality possible with the portability, simplicity and affordability modern listeners crave - became the third-most successful Kickstarter campaign in the website\'s history. It had raised more than $6M in pledges in 40 days. Encouraged by the enthusiastic response, Neil still had a long road ahead, and his Pono music player would not have the commercial success he\'d imagined. But he remained committed to his mission, and faced with the rise of streaming services that used even lower quality audio, he was determined to rise to the challenge.An eye-opening listen for all fans of Neil Young and all fans of great music, as well as listeners interesting in going behind the scenes of product creation, To Feel the Music has an inspiring story at its heart: One determined artist with a groundbreaking vision and the absolute refusal to give up, despite setbacks, naysayers, and skeptics.Get the book here:\xa0https://www.amazon.com/Feel-Music-Songwriters-Mission-High-Quality/dp/B07WG3YNLX/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=phil+baker&qid=1569462908&s=gateway&sr=8-1Check out the Neil Young Archives:\xa0https://neilyoungarchives.com | The Rock N Roll Archaeologist digs deep with Engineer, mixer and producer, Toby Scott.\xa0 Mostly notably as Bruce Springsteen’s main man on the mix board for almost 40 years, Toby worked hand in hand on over 15 albums by the Boss.\xa0 Lots’ of amazing stories and a few helpful hints on what it takes to be a class A engineer for a legend.\xa0 Kind makes him a legend too, eh?!Toby Scott is a music recording engineer, mixer and record producer. Scott has worked extensively with Bruce Springsteen, recording and mixing albums for the singer since 1980. Scott has also worked with other prominent artists such as Bob Dylan, Bette Midler, Tommy Tutone, Blue Öyster Cult, and The Replacements. He has recorded and mixed projects for commercials, movies, and television as primary engineer receiving nominations and awards from Grammy, Emmy and Oscar organizations.http://tobyscottaudio.com | This week Christian talks across the pond to Will Birch, author of the new book, ‘Cruel to Be Kind: The Life and Music of Nick Lowe from our friends at DaCapo Press.\xa0 The book comes out today!The definitive biography of singer-songwriter Nick Lowe, best-known for "Cruel to Be Kind" and "(What\'s So Funny \'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding"Described as "Britain\'s greatest living songwriter," Nick Lowe has made his mark as a pioneer of pub rock, power-pop, and punk rock and as a producer of Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, the Damned, and the Pretenders. He has been a pop star with his bands Brinsley Schwarz and Rockpile, a stepson-in-law to Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, and is the writer behind hits including "Cruel to Be Kind" and "(What\'s So Funny \'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding." In the past decades, however, he has distinguished himself as an artist who is equally acclaimed for the second act of his career as a tender yet sharp-tongued acoustic balladeer.Biographer Will Birch, who in addition to being a music writer was a drummer and songwriter with The Records, has known Lowe for over forty years and melds Lowe\'s gift as a witty raconteur with his own authoritative analysis of Lowe\'s background and the cultural scenes he exemplifies. Lowe\'s parallel fame as one of the best interviews in the business will contribute to this first look into his life and work--and likely the closest thing fans will get to an autobiography by this notoriously charming cult figure.This is not an authorized biography, but Lowe has given it his spiritual blessing and his management and label are fully on board. Cruel to Be Kind will be the colorful yet serious account of one of the world\'s most talented and admired musicians.Will Birch is a former drummer and songwriter with the Kursaal Flyers ("Little Does She Know") and The Records ("Starry Eyes"). During the 1980s he moved into record production, working with such acts as Any Trouble, Dr Feelgood, Hollies, Billy Bremner (Rockpile) and the Long Ryders. Throughout the 1990s Will wrote many articles for MOJO and other music magazines. He is the author of No Sleep Till Canvey Island: The Great Pub Rock Revolution, and Ian Dury: The Definitive Biography. He lives near London.https://www.amazon.com/Cruel-Be-Kind-Life-Music/dp/0306921952/ref=sr_1_1?crid=10TL5ABQ3MWDG&keywords=will+birch+nick+lowe&qid=1568071077&s=gateway&sprefix=will+birch%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-1 | Start Me Up! The Rock n Roll Archaeologist sits down with author Christopher McKittrick to discuss his new and very timely book, ‘Can’t Give It Away on Seventh Avenue: The Rolling Stones and New York City.When the Rolling Stones first arrived at JFK Airport in June 1964, they hadn’t even had a hit record in America. By the end of the decade, they were mobbed by packed audiences at Madison Square Garden and were the toast of New York City’s media and celebrity scene.More than fifty years later, the history of New York City and the Rolling Stones have entwined and paralleled, with the group playing in nearly all of the Big Apple’s legendary venues. Along the way Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and the rest of the Stones have left an impact on the culture of the city, from the turbulent “Fun City” of the 1960s and ’70s through the twenty-first century. The evolving career of the Stones has often reflected the cultural changes of the city, as the Stones and their music were the center of social and political controversies during the same era that New York faced similar challenges.Can’t Give It Away on Seventh Avenue: The Rolling Stones and New York City explores the history of the group through the prism of New York. It is a highly detailed document of the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between the world’s most famous band and America’s most famous city as well as an absorbing chronicle of the remarkable impact the city has had on the band’s music and career.Christopher McKittrick is a published author of fiction and non-fiction and a contributor to entertainment websites. Christopher and his work have been quoted in in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Observer, Newsday, USAToday.com, CNBC.com, Time.com, RollingStone.com, and dozens of entertainment and news websites.

Gold Village Entertainment was formed in July 2007 and marks the return to artist management for Goldberg. A complete roster of artists can be found here. His latest book is “Serving The Servant: Remembering Kurt Cobain” (Ecco, April 2019). Goldberg’s previous books include, “How The Left Lost Teen Spirit”, “Bumping Into Geniuses: My Life Inside The Rock and Roll Business” and “In Search of The Lost Chord: 1967 and the Hippie Idea”.From 1983-1992, Goldberg was the founder and President of Gold Mountain Entertainment, an artist management firm whose clients included Nirvana, Hole, Sonic Youth, Bonnie Raitt, The Allman Brothers, Rickie Lee Jones and more. Directly prior to the creation of Gold Village Entertainment, Goldberg had been the CEO of Air America Radio from 2005 until mid-2006. Goldberg formed the independent label Artemis Records in 1999 and ran the company until January of 2005.Prior to forming Artemis and prior to the acquisition of Polygram by Universal in 1998, Goldberg was Chairman and CEO of the Mercury Records Group, which was the number one U.S. label group in terms of market share in 1998. The Mercury Records Group included music from virtually all major genres; pop, R&B, hip-hop, country, jazz and rock and roll via its labels Def Jam, Mercury, Mercury Nashville, Motown, Verve, and Deutsche Gramophone, all of which reported to and were supervised by Goldberg. Before joining Mercury, Goldberg was Chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Records in 1995, during which time Warner Bros. was the number one U.S. record label. In 1993-94, he was President of Atlantic Records, also a division of the Warner Music Group, which likewise attained the number one ranking among U.S. companies during Goldberg’s tenure.Earlier in his career, Goldberg formed and co-owned Modern Records, which released Stevie Nicks’ solo albums including her number one album “Bella Donna.” Prior to that, Goldberg was Vice-President of Led Zeppelin’s Swan Song Records and worked with the band from 1973 through 1975. In 1980, Goldberg co-produced and co-directed the rock documentary feature, “No Nukes,” starring Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, and Jackson Browne, among others. https://www.amazon.com/Serving-Servant-Remembering-Kurt-Cobain-ebook/dp/B07CRHW9XD/ref=sr_1_2?crid=18HY0T9RU1MGR&keywords=danny+goldberg&qid=1565631169&s=gateway&sprefix=danny+gold%2Caps%2C188&sr=8-2http://goldve.com/ | This week The Rock N Roll Archaeologist gets a Masters education in gender politics of modern music by LMU Associate Professor Evelyn McDonnell.Evelyn McDonnell is associate professor of English and director of journalism at Loyola Marymount University.

Kushins as they discuss his new biography of legendary singer-songwriter Warren Zevon. The bio spans his nomadic youth and early recording career to his substance abuse, final album, and posthumous Grammy AwardsAs is the case with so many musicians, the life of Warren Zevon was blessed with talent and opportunity yet also beset by tragedy and setbacks. Raised mostly by his mother with an occasional cameo from his gangster father, Warren had an affinity and talent for music at an early age. Taking to the piano and guitar almost instantly, he began imitating and soon creating songs at every opportunity. After an impromptu performance in the right place at the right time, a record deal landed on the lap of a teenager who was eager to set out on his own and make a name for himself. But of course, where fame is concerned, things are never quite so simple.Drawing on original interviews with those closest to Zevon, including Crystal Zevon, Jackson Browne, Mitch Albom, Danny Goldberg, Barney Hoskyns, and Merle Ginsberg, Nothing\'s Bad Luck tells the story of one of rock\'s greatest talents. Journalist C.M. Kushins not only examines Zevon\'s troubled personal life and sophisticated, ever-changing musical style, but emphasizes the moments in which the two are inseparable, and ultimately paints Zevon as a hot-headed, literary, compelling, musical genius worthy of the same tier as that of Bob Dylan and Neil Young.In Nothing\'s Bad Luck, Kushins at last gives Warren Zevon the serious, in-depth biographical treatment he deserves, making the life of this complex subject accessible to fans old and new for the very first time.We love Vermont CBD!

The New York Times says it best: \'If you only know him as the guy who wrote \'Wild Thing\' and \'Angel Of The Morning\' - you don\'t know him!Chip Taylor is making some of the most distinctive acoustic music around today.\' \'Whiskey Salesman,\' his latest in a remarkable string of recent albums, is at once both personal and universal. It is an album filled with timeless, intimate love songs - poignant, meditative odes to life. And drinking (in moderation) songs. Their spirit is perhaps best captured by the videos Taylor has created for each and every song (included on a dvd). Filmed at his own apartment and local bar, and starring his wife and friends, Chip welcomes everybody into his warm, heartfelt world. \'Whiskey Salesman\' was co-produced by keyboardist Goran Grini and bass player Tony Mercadante.

Dewey shares a little behind the scenes of that initial first call with Fat Mike, what we didn’t hear in the interview. Ken reveals that he is in fact a podcast host himself! His show, titled Wax On, is essentially a college radio show run in his music room where him and his girlfriend play and discuss a handful of records with the occasional guest.\xa0Originally from Horshem, PA, Ken lived a pretty suburban life. He began piano lessons at age 5, imitating his older brother, which soon led to sibling competitiveness. At 9 he took on the bass guitar with his teacher, Rick Smith, that lead him through the entire Highway to Hell album. Ken shines insight on his musical upbringing with his dad’s cover band playing tunes such as “Heard it From the Grapevine”.\xa0Dewey inquires about the initial joining of The Starting Line, and how his age played into that. He was in fact only 14 when he began playing with Matt. Ken notes that the age gap between him and the rest of the members never seemed that strange. The two talk through the sound evolution of The Starting Line, and how different each album is.\xa0 Ken shares tales from days of touring with the RX Bandits and going deep into the “weed hole”.Ken shines light on the status of The Starting Line, why they went on hiatus, and what came of it.\xa0Don\'t forget to RATE, REVIEW, & SUBSCRIBE!

They discuss how movie trailer making is truly an art form, and how deceiving they can actually be. Dewey connects with Jon on the fact that he is LDS which is that is the way Dewey was brought up. That leads to the comparison of how strict their parents were, and if that had an effect on the type of TV and films they were exposed to in their youth. Jon shares that although he rarely consumed pop culture with his parents and had good judgement himself on what was appropriate, movies with a high sexual content still make him uncomfortable today. The two trade movie titles that they haven’t seen and question if watching certain iconic films of the 80’s would be the same seeing them for the first time today. Jon gave us insight to his creative spark and how that was fostered as a child through drawing and puppet shows with his twin brother. Once the two got older and had access to a video camera and sound mixer the fun really began. The subject of fame and privacy is something Jon is very passionate about and does not withhold his opinion. From family and friends, to strangers at\xa0 restaurants his fame is something that can not be overlooked. He explains how he navigates it all and the type of mentality it takes.

Though the name Matt Pond PA was retired in 2017 (a moniker for his recording and touring band of which he was the sole consistent member), his work over the last 12 years with musician and engineer Chris Hansen has led to film and commercial scoring, as well as An Orchestrated Impulse, a new multi-sensory collaboration with visual artist Eva Magill-Oliver, comprised of twelve paintings each paired with an instrumental composition in a different key. On today\'s show, Matt muses about The Minutemen\'s "Double Nickels on the Dime," why he\'s had to abandon three completely separate record collections over the years, the Beatles-influenced stage name he almost went by when he moved to Brooklyn and how his mom\'s confusion between John Waite and Tom Waits paved Matt\'s musical journey. The installation of An Orchestrated Impulse debuts October 11th at the O+ Festival in Kingston, NY with full performance details at  orchestratedimpulse.com, and accompanying music available for digital download at  anorchestratedimpulse.bandcamp.com.

His current musical project Dramatic Lovers can be found online at\xa0dramaticlovers.com. | In a relatively short amount of time, Matt Ross-Spang has grown from Sun Studio tour guide to one of the most sought-after producers and engineers in music. Having moonlighted behind the boards at Sun after business hours while juggling high-school, Matt helped bring the historic studio back to its analog roots and eventually stepped out on his own at the behest of Grammy-winner and Nashville studio staple Dave Cobb. This led to Matt engineering releases for John Prine, Jason Isbell, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Amanda Shires and Josh Ritter, as well as helming records for Margo Price, Lucero and Iron & Wine\'s latest collaboration with Calexico. Recently, Amazon even plucked him to produce, curate and debut a unique digital audio series featuring Al Green\'s first new recording in nearly a decade. To sum it up best, NPR describes Ross-Spang as "a music history geek with a brilliant ear for blending studio precision with spontaneity," while Rolling Stone touts him as "one of the most trusted arbiters of the Memphis sound." \xa0 That last moniker rings especially true this month, as Sony/Legacy celebrates the 50th anniversary of one of Elvis Presley\'s most pivotal years by releasing a massive 11CD box set and 2LP vinyl edition of performances from August 1969 at the International Hotel in Las Vegas. All originally recorded to 8-track and newly mixed to analog by Matt, this string of shows is especially notable for featuring a full orchestra and the live debut of one of the King\'s biggest hits, "Suspicious Minds." Recorded at Sam Phillips\' iconic studio in Memphis, today\'s interview features Matt\'s insight on the psychology of recording, examples of records where the room acts as an instrument, his trajectory within the industry and how a career in documenting music has changed the way he listens.

Armed with their shared PR experience, the duo headed up Asylum Records as the first women to ever helm a major country music label and flipped Nashville\'s Music Row on its ear, building longtime partnerships with Willie Nelson, Tammy Wynette, George Jones, Emmylou Harris, Lorrie Morgan, Randy Travis and more. Their countless years of experience, legendary debauchery and hilarious stories of life behind-the-scenes and on the road are now part of a new podcast courtesy of Momument Records called Shady Ladies Of Music City, which encourages listeners to submit their own country music rumors for discussion on the program, to find out if they\'re tall tales or legendarily confirmed stories. Today, Susan and Evelyn sit down to discuss the homogenized state of mainstream country radio, Pittsburgh\'s National Record Mart (the first music store chain ever in the United States), the industry\'s reaction to the launch of the compact disc, their childhood memories of 45RPM singles, and how to get rid of gold records. Podcast info, social media and more are available at\xa0shadyladiesofmusiccity.com. | Over three proper full-lengths and nearly a decade of touring, NYC quartet Soul Coughing merged spoken word, jazz, hip-hop and various avant-garde subgenres into a sound completely their own, notching a few 90\'s college radio and alt-rock hits in the process. This year, vocalist/guitarist Mike Doughty is on the road celebrating the 25th anniversary of their critically-acclaimed debut LP Ruby Vroom, performing a "real-time remix" of the record from start to finish with a new backing band. On today\'s show, Mike heralds Led Zeppelin IV, Miles Davis\' hand-painted cassette collection, Memphis\' Goner Records and the countless master tapes or unearthed treasures lost to the 2008 Universal Studios fire in Hollywood.

This year also finds Jeff -- a member of the Jimmy Kimmel Live! house band -- releasing a new album on vinyl ("El Musico," available via CDBaby) as well as touring with the radio variety program Live From Here.

This conversation delves into the background, context and scope of the book, harmony at Berklee, the source of conflation for tonal and modal harmony problems in guitarland and much more. This is a shorter episode than normal, but it gets heavy and spawns some new avenues to spiral down with further research, reading and exploration. Huge thanks to Joe and Tom for coming on.

This is a wonderful episode and I (Beebs breaking the wall here) want to thank Jack for having such an open, honest conversation about this stuff. The previous episode we did on this, 52. was of tremendous help for my own inner workings (Beebee breaking the wall here) and judging from the feedback and response to it, was relatable and helpful for many of you out there. We pick things back up here framed around Jack’s experience, however the conversation is multifaceted and the result is a rich discussion on the ups, down and managing when the wobbles come.

He tells us that it was not until later on, as an adult, he discovered this was a Stephen Foster tune after googling some of the words. We recorded this in a boat house, moments before Critter hoped on a boat to set off for The Punch Brothers tour. They were loading his bags as we spoke. With secondsto spare Critter lays down a near perfect rendition of "The Glendy Burk." I hope you enjoy! | Wallis Bird is a joyful musician who is an incredibly emotionally exciting live performer and songwriter. Originally from Ireland, Wallis suffered a major hand injury as a child that left her fingers permanently marred on one hand. She was able to work around that and become a stellar guitarist. One of seven children, she grew up around her parents\' pub and witnessed a number of interesting characters in an experienced that helped inform who she is. On Basic Folk we talk about her upbringing, her views on faith and spirituality and her immediate attraction to the guitar (starting with her first guitar at 6 months). We also get into her career talking about the publishing offers she started getting at 12 years old. Wallis was signed to a couple of major labels, but saw the writing on the wall as the label was hoping she would be another type of Amy Winehouse. Wallis is very business savvy and was lucky and smart enough to have navigated that situation quite well. Wallis currently resides in Berlin and talks about her affinity for the city and its tragic past. We also get into her feelings about her sexuality, gender and everything in between. Enjoy this great conversation!! Please subscribe! | Molly Sarle\xa0of Mountain Man\xa0has been working on her solo record for a little while and it\'s finally out! The beautiful Karaoke Angel\xa0is the Santa Cruz, CA\'s native debut album. During our conversation on Basic Folk, Molly talks about her family and where music was in her life growing up. We learn that she L O V E S musical theater and was in several productions in high school. She also talks about the tale of Mountain Man\'s origins and how she, an introvert, was approached by the very outgoing Amelia Meath, who insisted Sarle teach her the song she was singing. The incredible harmonies of Mountain Man, however, are different from the ones we find on Molly\'s solo work, which was recorded in a church. We dig into a few very interesting topics like religion! sex! and cats! | Joe Troop, frontman for the Buenos Aires "Latin-Grass" group Che Apalache, has loved bluegrass since he was 15. He kind of discovered that fact almost at the same time he discovered his attraction to men. As a North Carolina native, Troop is a proud out gay man in a world that doesn\'t always accept him: the rural south. Through his travels throughout Spain, Japan and Argentina, he\'s become and advocate for gay and for immigrant rights. Joe talks about all this and more: how he can expertly subvert a hot topic in his songs and in his life to a crowd that might not be openly ready to talk about it. Joe Troop has a very interesting mind! It\'s wonderful to hear about his experiences living abroad, being out in the bluegrass world, working with Bela Fleck and his relationship to both liberals and conservatives. Please enjoy and subscribe! | I recently came across an old interview with Tori Amos I did when I was a TERRIFIED 23 year old. Her album "The Beekeeper"\xa0 (that version I linked has the special Garland song that I asked her about!!!) had just come out along with her autobiography\xa0Piece by Piece\xa0that she wrote with the amazing Ann Powers. This is a pretty interesting Tori Amos interview talking about her album that came out around that time. We talk about touring with her daughter and sharing her music with Tash. She also talks about a few ins and outs about\xa0The Beekeeper and entertains my weird Boston-centric questions. HOWEVER, the most hilarious aspect of this interview (for me) is how I am so scared to talk to my hero in a one on one interview. I also sound like a small baby-child with a slight Boston accent. The interview is v short, so please enjoy this truncated episode of Basic Folk with the most magical woman in the world and your dorky host. I almost believe her compliments about the interview at the end of the episode. She is unearthly!!! | Amanda Shires, Texas born, Nashville based, sideplayer turned songwriter, turned force of nature in Americana, folk and alt-country world. Her partnership with Jason Isbell is legendary. Her most current project, The Highwomen, is well on it\'s way to legendary status. Starting her career at 15 with the Texas Playboys, Shires found herself on the road for the first time with a group of 70 & 80 year old gentlemen. She cut her teeth and learned plenty in that experience. Moving to Nashville to establish her songwriting career, she got close to her friend Jason Isbell after a serious injury to her left ring finger. Isbell offered to drive her to doctor\'s appointments and their relationship grew from there.  Amanda radiates a friendly, goofy and open hearted personality that translates into her playing and writing. That all comes through the minute you meet her, whether you talk to her for 2 minutes or are her best friend on the road with her (hi Kelly!). We get some great stories from her during this interview like her asking Brandi Carlile to start The Highwomen with her moments before Brandi Carlile had to perform on-stage and the anger she feels at her husband when he tries to use her Leonard Cohen guitar. Also in the Lightning Round, we learned that Amanda loves rap & hip-hop and when she was learning Texas fiddle, she really wanted to be a hip-hop fiddlist. Amanda Shires is so fun and cool! Enjoy this interview. | David Huckfelt, founding member of the Minneapolis folk band, The Pines, emanates poetry in everything he does. From his solo work to his outlook on life, Huckfelt is living artwork. It was a real pleasure to speak with him about his Iowa upbringing, his connection to indigenous people and his two-week solitary writing retreat on the most remote and least visited national park in mighty Lake Superior. I attempt to get David to admit that he, like most people his age, were into Ninja Turtles and The Lion King as a young kid, but he kept coming back with examples like really being into Waylon Jennings on The Sesame Street movie "Follow The Bird" and Muddy Waters on Mr. Rogers. The guy is just cool. Anyways, we get into a pretty deep and serious conversation about souls, rights of women and spirituality. David is a theology school drop-out and he talks about what caused him to walk away from that life path. David\'s music sounds like the earth. It has this warm darkness to it and on his solo album Stranger Angels, he uses really interesting field recordings on different songs. That gives it an extra sometimes eery layer. Thanks for listening and I hope you enjoy getting to know this very interesting and deeply soulful person. | Scottish-American songwriter Johnathan Rice might have first landed on your radar through his duo Jenny & Johnny with his former partner Jenny Lewis. Rice\'s story starts in Virginia and Scotland where he spent time going back and forth for his dad\'s work. Each place having its own effect on his young musicianship. Virginia embodied a typical mid-90\'s American teen experience where he loved Nirvana and actually had a first hand encounter with Dave Grohl, who lived nearby. In Scotland, he was surrounded by a large family where music was front and center. It was not uncommon for the family to gather and Rice, after spending time practicing for the moment, would perform in front of his first audiences. Johnathan discusses his early connections to the Saddle Creek music scene, which revolved around Conor Oberst (Bright Eyes), who he claims very much influenced his writing early on. He also talks about his 12 year relationship with Jenny Lewis and how his latest album\xa0The Long Game was inspired by times during their relationship, during the breakup and the aftermath. Recently, Johnathan has become known for his Instagram haikus, which he has a published book and fill up most of his feed. It was a pleasure to get to know Johnathan during this interview. He\'s kind, attentive, generous and has great dry-humor to his delivery, which shows up in his writing. Hope you enjoy! | Basic Folk is Live at Club Passim! Alisa Amador grew up in Cambridge, MA surrounded by the influence of her parents\' Latin group Sol y Canto. She has managed to cultivate a warm sound that walks the line of folk, jazz, blues, soul and Latin. One thing so apparent about these laid back, warm songs is their similarities to the human that\'s writing and performing them. Alisa talks about growing up with her twin sister (pre-iPad) on tour with her parents riding in the minivan, including a fun yelling game the bass player made up called "la Orquesta." She also talks about the life-changing experience of traveling to Buenos Aires to visit her 96 year old grandfather.\xa0 There she met some area musicians who completely changed everything for her. She\'s a wonderful storyteller, and listening to her talk about her history and her songs was an extremely heart-opening experience. I hope you enjoy her music and getting to know this lovely person. | Basic Folk is live at Club Passim with Melissa Ferrick! The indie folk songwriter genius lesbian icon joins us for our very first live recording of the podcast. We get honest conversation and live music from Melissa, who had recently moved to Cambridge, graduated grad school at Harvard and got a new teaching job at Northeastern. She played songs from her latest self-titled album as well as a new song while talking about details of the song lyrics and her life. Melissa, who claimed that she was normally asleep by the time she hit the stage (around 9pm), was charming, funny and man those songs.... they sounded amazing.  The conversation ranges from talking about the Michigan Womyn\'s festival to empathy for the driver that cuts you off to the 1650\'s house she grew up in. We had a great time despite being up so late.', 'chan_desc': 'American Folk Music has been a part of the popular culture for over 5 decades. The last rush of popularity in a particular kind of singer-songwriter was in the 1990’s/Early 2000’s: Suzanne Vega, Shawn Colvin, Patty Griffin, Amos Lee, Ray Lamontagne, Ani Difranco, Gillian Welch. Since then, up and coming folk musicians and singer songwriters of this caliber are still appearing and creating great music. Basic Folk is a podcast that intends to introduce you to the what’s next in the folk world and give you deeper insight on artists that you might know or are just getting to know.

In fact, only earlier this year did we actually capture the first-ever picture of a black hole. Plus, the 2014 sc-fi movie Interstellar really did their homework as the movie depictions look surprisingly similar to these recent concepts from NASA. Then, I recently discovered a wonderful site called OCEARCH that is a hub for all the tracked sharks, whales, turtles, seals and more sea life in the ocean.

Dave went to school for music business and eventually ended up working for Live Nation in their sales department. Sales weren't something he ever thought he would do, but he excelled at it, and that career path led to applying for the new sales department job here. Since Dave joined the team, The World's Strongest Coffee has gone from being on the shelves of a handful of stores to almost 10,000 at the time of recording this episode, thanks to the tireless efforts of Dave Ratzer and Eric Donovan. Check out the transcript and more at www.deathwishcoffee.com/daveratzer | On science this week from Fueled By Death Cast, NASA is rolling out a brand new series called #AskNASA. You can use the hashtag on Twitter to ask NASA a question and they might have an astronaut or scientist answer on one of the shows, premiering every Monday on nasa.gov. We replay the first episode which just so happens to feature astronaut Serena Aunon-Chancellor, who was drinking Death Wish Coffee on the International Space Station last year! Plus, NASA asked Brad Pitt some questions about his new movie Ad Astra to help start the whole series! Then, NASA is working with astronauts in space to develop a new understanding of asthma and how it can be treated both here on Earth, and on other worlds. | Mother. Manager. Badass. All of this and more describes Barbaranne Wylde, and she came to the studio to join episode 145 of the podcast. Barbaranne was in the area to attend a gala benefiting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and she talks about how she and her husband Zakk Wylde first got connected with this incredible facility. Zakk has been playing guitar with Ozzy Osbourne since the late 80s, and the Wylde's have been a part of the Osbourne family ever since. Barbaranne and Zakk have a beautiful family of four kids and multiple dogs, and she works hard to balance family and business, helping to manage much of Zakk's career since the beginning and talks about her own start in the music business. Also, find out how Death Wish Coffee partnered with the Wylde's to create Valhalla Java Odinforce Blend and hear the story of Barbaranne and Zakk's first date in eighth grade! Check out the full transcript and more at www.deathwishcoffee.com/wylde | This week on science from Fueled By Death Cast, astronomers have discovered another interstellar object, and this one could be a comet. The first object, Oumuamua, was discovered only a week before it flew out of our solar system into the universe. This new object should be in our solar system for almost a year, giving scientists enough time to properly study it. Plus, if it does turn out to be a comet, the discovery could lead to some surprising data about the universe itself. Then, NASA won two Creative Arts Emmy Awards. one for the coverage of the first test of the Crew Dragon capsule, which launched from Cape Canaveral and docked with the International Space Station for the first time. The second award was for the interactive coverage NASA and JPL produced for the Mars InSight lander mission, which is still getting data today on the red planet. | Niles Deneen of Deneen Pottery joins the 144th episode of the podcast this week. Deneen is a second-generation pottery business that got its start in the 1970s from Niles's father. From meager beginnings of making a handful of mugs with only four glaze colors, the small business has blossomed into producing over 600,000 mugs a year. These mugs are all hand-thrown, fired in a kiln and glazed in Deneen's facility, which is doing its part to reduce its carbon footprint and create incredible art at the same time. Death Wish Coffee has been working with Deneen Pottery since almost the beginning, and Niles talks about his unique relationship, the pottery industry, and just how these beautiful mugs are made. Check out the transcript and videos at www.deathwishcoffee.com/deneen | On this week's science segment from Fueled By Death Cast, it's all about dinosaurs. First, a new dinosaur species was identified in Japan. Kamuysaurus Japonicus is a new genus and species of hadrosaurid or duck-billed dinosaur. This new find will help scientists to further unlock the mysteries of these dinosaurs, including their reasons for being near large bodies of water. Then, new evidence about Tyrannosaurs Rex suggests that the holes in their skulls might work like giant thermostats. Much like alligators today have temperature regulators in their skull, the T. Rex could also have had this biological phenomenon. | Brandon Dermer joins the podcast for episode 39 of season 3! Brandon is a man of many hats - a filmmaker, writer, producer, cinematographer, director and more. We talk about how he got his start in the industry and how his career has changed and evolved in the last few years. From creating content for Comedy Central and Viceland to working on music videos for Panic! at the Disco and Nekrogoblikon, Brandon has done a lot, including making some of the first commercials ever for Death Wish Coffee. We also talk about the origins of the series What Would Diplo Do? starring James Van Der Beek.

The final clean lab tests are being performed, and some of the last pieces of technology are being added to the rover, including the very interesting Mars Helicopter. Developed by NASA, the helicopter flies differently than a helicopter in on Earth, having to compensate for the gravity and atmosphere of the red planet. One of the final things left to do with the Mars 2020 rover is to give it a name! So kids all across the country from grades K-12 have the chance to submit their suggestion and a short essay explaining their name choice to NASA by Nov.1. The names will be voted on and a winner announced on Feb 18th, 2020, exactly one year before the rover touches down on the surface of Mars. | It's season 3 episode 38, so meet Jim Sweeney, former NY Jets, Seattle Seahawks, and Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman.
