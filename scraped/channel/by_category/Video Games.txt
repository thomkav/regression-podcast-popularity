Its been a long, strange year, but we are excited to be back in the game and on the air. This is a lore free episode, but we wanted to talk through our return, the reasons why, and set expectations in its own standalone episode so it wouldn\'t bog down next week\'s release, which will be a full-on deep dive into Emperor Calus and the Cabal.

Xbox held an Inside Xbox episode this week, and we got some updates on The Outer Worlds and Project XCloud. Finally, the Medal of Honor series is making a comeback with Respawn developing a new game - and it's going to be entirely in VR! Will a full length shooter campaign in VR help grow VR in gaming?

We talk about how important it was for Xbox to score a win with a first party game this fall, and we talk about the campaign and multiplayer modes in Gears 5 - which are awesome and which are not? Borderlands 3 has released, as well as NHL 20. We talk about our experiences with both, and (surprise!) how at least one of us likes one of them a lot more than they thought they would. Why is each game worth your time and money? Listen to find out! E3 2020 is still almost nine months away, but news surfaced this week about some potentially big changes in how E3 might look next year compared to years past.

In this episode I talk with author and consultant Nir Eyal about how to use psychology and other methods to avoid being distracted by video games and other technology when you don\'t want to be. It\'s all in his new book, Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, available now.Nir discusses the psychology behind distraction and its opposite, which he calls "traction." Along with this, we talk about specific strategies for getting more traction and when it\'s okay to be distracted by video games, social media, and other technology. | Psychology of Games Summer Book Club begins with an interview with Dr. Pete Etchells, author of the newly released Lost in a Good Game. | My guest experts and I discuss how moral choices in video games are different from other media and what makes them so difficult. We also discuss some of our favorite and most compelling choices from games. | Empathy --the ability to understand and share the emotions of others-- is a powerful tool for those wanting to create games where the goal is to get players to think differently and have powerful emotional experiences. It can be used to great effect and probably plays a big part in more games than you realize. But leveraging empathy in games has its own risks and pitfalls. Designers who do so need to be aware of these so that they can successfully create the outcomes they want and so that players aren\'t abused or exposed to undue distress. Fortunately, my guest expert on this episode, Kelli Dunlap PsyD, is here to help us explore and understand this psychological concept. | Special ALL HAWAII EDITION! To give me a little breathing room after finishing up my book manuscript, here are two complete interviews I did while researching the recent loot box podcast episode.  One is the full interview with Representative Chris Lee, and the other is with Ed White, who has provided testimony during hearings on the topic. | What is the relationship between loot boxes and problematic gambling? Should loot boxes be considered a form of gambling? In this episode I talk with Chris Lee, a politician, and David Zendle, a researcher, who are both very interested in the answers to those questions. | How do game developers make virtual items as collectible as physical objects? | I talk with Dr. Anthony Bean and several of his collaborators on a book about psychology and the Legend of Zelda. | I talk with Dr. Richard Landers, an expert researcher on gamification and game-based assessments. We discuss some of the psychology behind why gamification does (and does not) work, as well as why it\'s so difficult to do it well. We also talk about the use of actual games to assess people\'s skills and abilities. Is it possible to create, for example, a game that measures people\' general mental ability? | I talk in this episode with my guest expert, Megan Connell PsyD, who uses Dungeons & Dragons in group therapy with remarkable results and runs a weekly D&D game with psychology nerds on Twitch. We also discuss what lessons psychology has for helping other people at the table --possibly including yourself-- and how to find and get along with a new gaming group.', 'chan_desc': 'Examining how psychology explains why video games are made how they are and why gamers behave as we do.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/4b/05/50/4b05504f-d357-7a78-206b-752151277ffd/mza_1344862438020984691.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-03-12'}}

From initial skepticism over the fantasy series\' pivot to science fiction, the gang are slowly won over by Planetfall\'s novel solutions to expansion and city management, diplomacy with minor factions, and glorious tactical combat. | Nicole Clark joins Rowan and Rob to talk about Klei\'s Oxygen Not Included and its punishing model of offworld colonizaiton.Learn how everything that can go wrong does go wrong, and how well the game communicates excruciating detail about why your colony is dying. | Rowan, Fraser, and Rob are joined by Kotaku\'s Gita Jackson to discuss their tenure as teachers at Garreg Mach Monastery. The gang talk about the really thougthful politics and characterizations that define Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Aside from that, is it a good tactics game? And finally, the gang gets into some serious spoilers about the game\'s shocking reveal midway through. | Rob, Troy, and Bruce get together to discuss Mark Herman\'s epic wargame of the Peloponnesian Wars, Pericles. How does it capture the sweep of a vast historical subject that was only sometimes decided through military conquest? | The Tehran Conference. The meeting at Appomattox. The Council of Elrond. All historical gatherings that pale in comparison to the summit that occurred in late July 2019 as the Three Moves Ahead team gathered in Oregon for several days of gaming. Hosted by Dr. Bruce Geryk, Gerykon 2019 was attended by Michael Hermes, Rob Zacny, and Troy "I hope they let me back into Canada" Goodfellow. Bruce played the part of eccentric board game sommelier, guiding the group through several layers of gaming history. Our first episode about Gerykon 2019 covers several entries from Reiner Knizia, a household name among those in the know. From the dizzying heights of Ra and Modern Art to the baffling lows of Beowulf, we consumed great amounts of scotch and had many discussions about game design and strategy. Also, Rob made up a really gross name for a painting. | Rob and the gang are deeply conflicted over Steel Division 2. A good multiplayer game with some genuinely impressive detail about the armored combat on the Eastern Front, it\'s also a game that has not grown to match its subject, and then there\'s the matter of that campaign... | Rob, Rowan, TJ, and Sean discuss how "historically" they like their games to play out and whether that wish is incompatibile with player freedom and variety. | Rob and Troy are bad revolutionary judges in We. The Revolution. But is there such thing as a good judge on a tribunal as compromised as this? It doesn\'t look like it in Polyslash\'s grim political adventure. The gang discuss the historical perspective that We. The Revolution adopts as well as its curious feature-creep as it moves from a straightforward legal procedural to something far more ambitious and less coherent. Why are you fighting for control of Paris? Why are you commanding soldiers in battle? Are its systems of political intrigue and persuasion any fun to use? The more you play, the less sense We. The Revolution seems to make, but the more hypnotic it becomes. | Nice island you got here, shame if it wasn\'t fully industrialized! Fortunately Jon, Troy, and Rob are here to strip mine, clear-cut, and redevelop the hell out everything in sight. Troy puts this latest entry in the broader context of both the series and city builders in generals, Jon has made some mistakes, and Rob is both dazzled by the game\'s beauty but wishes it more fully captured the impact of heavy industry on nature. Also he is convinced somehow he can make a sensible grid layout out of a game built to confound them. | This week\'s show is the alternate universe version of our 2013 episode on Total War: Rome II. It was two hours of non-stop slamming that poor game - a real massacre. But here we find ourselves in 2019 with Total War: Three Kingdoms in front of us, and things are different. It\'s good. It\'s very good. The load times are short. The AI seems competent. The vibrant Three Kingdoms setting is brought to life with both a story mode and a gloriously ahistorical mode that lets the characters shine.

In years past I have fought Call of Duty zombies on a phone, and even used a Nintendo DS stylus to aim down the sights (I don’t recommend it) in similarly scaled-down and unambitious games designed for the limitations of those platforms. But the succinctly titled Call of Duty: Mobile is different. | Nintendo’s mobile efforts have been divisive to say the least. Since the launch of Super Mario Run in 2016 it has struggled to combine its traditional quality of gameplay with mobile’s monetization in a fair and effective way. Few people seemed happy with Mario Run’s premium price of $10, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp’s dearth of content made it less than exciting to invest in, and Dragalia Lost, Fire Emblem Heroes, and Dr. | If patterns hold true, EA’s FIFA 20 will no doubt sell enough physical copies to reach to the Moon and back – but when it comes to on-pitch action, there’s only one soccer game this season that truly shoots for the stars. eFootball PES 2020 – to use its horrible full name – is one of Konami’s finest football games in years. | If you’ve seen a trailer or any preview footage for Code Vein True to its anime inspirations, Code Vein has a lot of story. Your custom character awakens in the ruins of a city as an undead “revenant” who feeds on blood in a wild, Mad Max-style, ghoul-eat-ghoul world. There are more revenants than people, which means food is scarce. | Nintendo’s mobile efforts have been divisive to say the least. Since the launch of Super Mario Run in 2016 it has struggled to combine its traditional quality of gameplay with mobile’s monetization in a fair and effective way. Few people seemed happy with Mario Run’s premium price of $10, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp’s dearth of content made it less than exciting to invest in, and Dragalia Lost, Fire Emblem Heroes, and Dr. | In a way that’s very appropriate for a cross-country road trip across an alien-infested United States, Overland is a harsh and unforgiving game. That’s especially true while you’re learning the rules of its turn-based tactics and tightly limited inventory management – none of which it tells you and many of which punish you severely for not knowing them. | You’ll begin as Kaiser, a generic machine-gun toting cyborg dude-bro who looks like a deranged knock-off of Duke Nukem, but you can then play as either him or the other three characters: Ms. Harakiri, a woman with an alien infused into her stomach; Hungry Beast, a cyborg Panda with a bit of a temper that looks and feels totally out of place; and The Gentleman, a sophisticated alien who has taken up arms for your side. | Like many regular people, I often toss and turn in bed at night restlessly kept from sleep by the same persistent question: what if Hitman’s Agent 47 were a goose? Well, me and my fellow feather-inclined friends can finally rest easy, as the unrelentingly charming and wonderfully absurd Untitled Goose Game has finally brought our sleepless nights peace by showing us the answer - and that answer is a magical kind of fowl play that replaces murder with merciless annoyance. | I’ve had to reassess the way I’ve played FIFA this year, which is something I haven’t had to do in many years through all the tweaks, changes and so called “game-changing mechanics”. FIFA 20 feels different to previous years; in some ways for the better, but in others not. | GreedFall is almost everything I want out of a big, juicy, old-school RPG. While it’s still lacking a lot of polish, the exciting combat and excellent, complex quest writing bring it very close to that winning formula of a mid-2000s BioWare game – something the developer, Spiders, has previously aimed for but missed with its last couple of releases (and BioWare itself hasn’t shown much interest in lately).', 'chan_desc': "Reviews for the hottest games of the year from IGN.

Sure, we've already talked extensively about this latest entry in the series, but there's always more to say. From Rick's early adventures in Maddening mode to Patrick's comparisons of his time spent with each house's campaign, this opening segment provides a nice bow on our coverage of one of Nintendo's best offerings of 2019.After that, the guys get into a lengthy discussion of how each of them handle stretches like the Nintendo has lined up for the second half of the year, where it seems like one must-play game is released after another. When you can't play everything, what do you play, and why? From low budgets to lack of time, there are plenty of reasons it's tough to get to every major title that hits the shelves and eShop. Turns out that the guys each have a different approach, whether it's sticking to tried-and-true franchises, specific genres, or trying as much as possible until something sticks. How about you?Finally, Rick wraps things up with some brief second impressions of\xa0The Sinking City. For all this and more, have a listen! | We love doing developer interviews, and this week is a good one: Adam Volker of Flight School Studio joins us to talk about their recent release, Creature in the Well. Having served as creative director on the project, Adam gives Rick, Patrick, and newcomer Campbell Gill insight into the project's creation, construction, and even a little bit of what the developers have learned since the release. Important questions are answered, such as: is this really a 'pinball' game? What part of the game was inspired by\xa0Sesame Street? And a solution is given to perhaps the most difficult puzzle of all: how in the sandy world do you heal your wounded BOT-C? Fans of this recently released action-puzzle game — as well as anyone interested in game design — won't want to miss it!Later, Campbell gives Rick and Patrick the rundown on\xa0Daemon X Machina, a new Switch game where apparently flying around as a giant robot while blowing stuff up is actually pretty fun! It turns out that a lot has been improved from the early (and shaky) demo, but how does someone screw up a story that involves the moon exploding? You'll have to tune in to find out.Finally, the guys offer their impression of Nintendo's latest bit of wackiness,\xa0Ring Fit Adventure, an exercise-based game that will supposedly give players abs of steel while they explore a fantasy land and out-workout a slew of monsters along the way. Frankly, however, we spend more time discussing the video's actors. For all this and more, have a listen!For more info on\xa0Creature in the Well, check out their website. | There just never seems to be enough time to talk about everything going on in the world of Nintendo these days, so this week we have another jam-packed show. To kick things off, Rick, Tim, and Patrick are joined by\xa0Goomba Stomp contributor\xa0Renan Fontes\xa0to talk about Rick’s time spent testing the\xa0Switch Lite. Just what did out editor-in-chief think about Nintendo’s latest dedicated handheld, and what sort of consumer might it appeal to? Will it entice players away from getting a ‘normal’ Switch?Next up, Patrick and Renan give a full review of the acclaimed\xa0Astral Chain\xa0(with a little bit of help from Neuron force rookie Tim). After his initial impressions weren’t so hot, has the game’s in-depth combat and detective-based exploration finally won Patrick over? Or has the tense and irritating situation escalated beyond the point of repair? Regardless, Renan explains how Platinum’s latest action opus just might be his game of the year, especially with the all the post-game content keeping him busy. It’s a well-rounded discussion that should provide a good overview from both a casual and expert position.In the last segment, the guys pick which announcements from the latest Nintendo Direct got them the most excited.\xa0Xenoblade,\xa0Return of the Obra Din, and even Super NES games online each make an appearance. So for all this and more on the NXpress Nintendo Podcast, have a listen! | This week the starts off with a bang, as Rick, Tim, and Patrick begin what seems like an innocent discussion of the now-delayed Switch release of Decay of Logos, but quickly turn it into a lively debate about the responsibilities of reviewers who have received codes for broken games. Those interested in getting a peek behind the scenes of a website like Goomba Stomp will get a good dose of multiple philosophies on how to handle publishers and what is owed to the readers. It's a lengthy back-and-forth, but we think it's worth a listen!After all the arguing, things settle down with some previews from PAX West, as Tim relates some of the indies he got a chance to try out in person, and Rick delivers a review of FAR: Lone Sails for the Switch. This indie revolving around a child operating a steampunk-ish transport across post-apocalyptic landscapes is reminiscent of\xa0Inside, but finds its own way to be one of the most relaxing, enjoyable games of the year so far.This week's episode ends with Patrick's first impressions of\xa0Astral Chain. Does he agree with Brent's enthusiastic review, or has this sci-fi action game not managed to arrest him quite yet? For all this and more, have a listen! | From a packed house to a nearly empty one, this week sees Tim and Patrick carrying the gaming torch on their own, as they deliver finalized reviews of Fire Emblem: Three Houses and\xa0The Sinking City, as well as thoughts on the latest Nintendo indie showcase.So, after 90-odd hours of battle, drama, comedy, tea time, fishing, lost-and-found, and vigorous recruitment, does Three Houses hold up all the way through to the end — or even beyond? Seeing as how Patrick basically hasn't been able to put it down since he first picked it up, the short answer is probably yes. However, the guys go into more detail (though spoiler-free), discussing the gameplay differences between pre- and post-time skip, the difficulty for newcomers to the series, and whether it's worth starting over to play other houses.After that, we go through some of the bigger titles spotlighted in Nintendo's Indie World, pick our standouts, and talk about how important it is for indie games to differentiate themselves from the growing mob of titles. Last, Tim reviews\xa0The Sinking City, a Lovecraftian detective story involving ancient gods in an atmospheric urban setting. Will fans of the author get more out of this? How do the puzzles work, and are they effective at making the player feel like they've solved a mystery? For all this and more, have a listen! | We've got a packed house for this week's show, but the more is merrier when discussing Goomba Stomp's recently published list ranking the Mario series. How does one assess greatness? It ain't easy, but there are enough strong opinions to go around to dispute some of the results. Rick, Tim, and Patrick are joined by Izsak Barnette and Game Boys co-host Ryan Kapioski to weigh in with our own picks for the best (and worst) Mario games, reignite the debate between Super Mario 3 and\xa0Super Mario World, jab at\xa0Sunshine a bit, and detail in general the thoughts that go into ranking games like these.Before that, however, Izsak Barnette tells us about that time he went crazy and didn't play video games for a week. What was he thinking, and what did he learn? It turns out that there's a whole other world of things to do. Who knew? And finally, Ryan gives us the rundown on Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order, and whether this Switch exclusive has enough combat and fan service to be worth your dollars. It's another episode full of twists and turns and tangents, so for all this and more, tune in! | After last week's one-on-one with\xa0Fire Emblem: Three Houses, the guys go back to a more traditional show this week, as Rick and Patrick are joined by Izsak Barnette to discuss what we've been playing, a new Smash Bros. Ultimate character, and Goomba Stomp's recently published list of the best games from each year in the past three decades, as voted on by our staff. How many Nintendo titles took the top prize? And how many years were they blanked from even getting nominated? The results are pretty interesting, and may lend some insight as to why so many gamers are loyal to Nintendo consoles, even when it means less gaming options.Before that, however, Izsak tells us about what's going on with Hero, the latest DLC for\xa0Smash. It turns out there may be some weird quirks to his moveset, but is he overpowered? This somehow leads to a conversation about our personal views on esports in general, but bear with us. Lastly, we close with a few more words from Patrick about the excellent Three Houses, including an assurance to Rick that this game doesn't ever turn into\xa0The Bachelor. And be sure to stick around for Rick's review of\xa0The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia, which apparently is better than just another coffee table book. For all this and more, have a listen! | This week on the NXpress Nintendo Podcast, Patrick invites Goomba Stomp's anime editor and Fire Emblem expert Matthew Ponthier to discuss in-depth, Fire Emblem: Three Houses. | The calm before the storm is officially over, as the release of\xa0Mario Maker 2 kicks off the bounty of Nintendo's solid lineup of 2nd-half games for 2019. in our main segment this week, Tim and Patrick are joined by Goomba Stomp writers Izsak Barnette and Ty Davidson to give our impressions on the new features and refinements, and whether or not this sequel does enough to improve upon an already stellar original. Do we know how to design expert Mario levels? Probably not, but it turns out that there's plenty of creativity and inspiration already out there from the Nintendo community to last a lifetime! From themed levels to a more classic approach, Mario Maker 2 has a little something for anyone who's a fan of the little plumber who could.After that, Izsak continues his series on the tech behind Nintendo's various consoles. This week it's the N64 and Gamecube, and you may be surprised with some of the interesting engineering decisions made in constructing these two legendary machines. Before all that, however, the guys also briefly offer up some thoughts on the newly announced Switch Lite. Is this dedicated handheld device a great alternative for the casual gamer, or something that might confuse the brand? All this and more on the NXpress Nintendo Podcast.\xa0", 'chan_desc': "The NXpress Nintendo Switch Podcast is Goomba Stomp's award-winning flagship podcast, a weekly show focusing on all things Nintendo.

Nick talks about his experience co-oping Borderlands 3 and the group dives a little deeper into the whimsy new remake of Link\'s Awakening! We also give updates on our recent Patreon milestone and get into the Halloween spirit with some horror movie / game recommendations! | After an unexpected week off, the games and news have been piling up so we do our best to play catch up! Chris Davis joins us at the start of the show to talk Gears 5 with Nick plus the delightful new Untitled Goose Game! The group hashes out there first impressions of the Link\'s Awakening remake and revisits Astral Chain and Greedfall to see how they are shaping up. The second segment is dominated by The Last of Us 2, Batman rumors, and some... colorful stories inspired by questions from our lovely Patreon supporters. | Welcome to the first episode of the Revival Club! Every few months, members of the community nominate, vote on, and play a game to discuss in Discord! We will wrap up each game with a short podcast where we will have a chance to respond to questions or thoughts shared by the community! In our first episode, Nick and Brad talk about the legacy of Devil May Cry 3 and how it continues to age in a post-Devil May Cry 5 world! | Ed returned from PAX West 2019 in Seattle with a giant list of games to talk about! There is a lot of big stuff on the horizon but let this podcast serve as a reminder that there is a ton of exciting Indie experiences worth looking out for!

Nick talks Greedfall, a new "Eurojank" RPG, and Brad finally dug into the new Platinum Games title, Astral Chain. Brad returns to Monster Hunter World for the Iceborne expansion and Nolan goes WAY back with Final Fantasy 8 Remastered. Of course... Nintendo is finally getting back into the Fitness market with Ring Fit Adventure on the Switch. | What a week! Nick somehow found the time to play a ton of Control, start Man of Medan, AND finish Blair Witch! Speaking of Blair Witch, this new game comes highly recommended from Nick\'s corner. Nolan refunded a game on Steam (What could it be???) but is having a great time revisiting Final Fantasy 8 thanks to the new remaster. We ponder the implications of a big loss for Tango Gameworks and Brad gives the rundown of the week\'s jam packed Nintendo Direct! | This week\'s episode is jam packed with bad (Nolan) jokes, big news, and exciting new games! Nick and Krispy discuss the beautiful and bizarre world of Control, the latest game from the minds behind Max Payne and Alan Wake. Nolan shares his impressions of Telling Lies, this year\'s spiritual follow-up to Her Story. Chris Davis shares his initial impressions of Remnant: From the Ashes, a new original IP from Gunfire games. | Ed makes his triumphant and welcome return to the show and brings with him, tales of all the games he\'s been catching up on during his time away! We take a look at Ion Fury, Krispy shares his take on No Mans Sky Beyond in VR, and Brad gushes over the latest and greatest Final Fantasy Tactics clone (unfortunately) called Fell Seal: Arbiter\'s Mark. We react to the newly released Avengers and Death Stranding footage and talk about the bits of news coming out of Gamescom over the past few days. We also squeeze in some good poop stories and talk about the shocking announcement of a new Matrix movie!\xa0 | This episode is full minor inconveniences. Nick learns some unfortunate truths about Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and the community at large challenges the group to show them their devious side. Brad talks about Rebel Galaxy Outlaw, Chris Davis brings impressions of Secret Neighbor, and Nolan gives his final impressions of Dragon Quest Builders 2 now that the credits have rolled! The news is also packed with some... interesting developments involving Bully 2, Rockstar, and THQ Nordic! | We dive deep into the nitty gritty of Fire Emblem: Three Houses this week to explain why it is a game that should be on any RPG fan\'s radar. Nick talks about how Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines finally sunk it\'s fangs in and makes Chris Davis a happy man by finally getting serious about playing Ace Combat 7! Nolan, Krispy, and Brad all talk about their Dragon Quest Builders 2 addiction.\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'This weekly show features the staff of 4PlayerNetwork.com as they discuss video games (both old and new), game industry news, and respond to feedback from the community!

Topics include: Weaver, Faceless Void being the only carry (?!), Clinkz, new Juggernaut builds, Sniper, the strength of creepcutting as an offlaner (especially Axe!), Phantom Lancer, Abaddon, and plenty more!

We're also covering more calibration games, safelane ideas, 4 Mirana being undeniably strong, Ursi being tortured emotionally by a nameless coworker, warding nuance, gold rationing as a 5, optimizing starting items, and more! We played 2 games this week, the first one being 1 Mars with 5 Witch Doctor and the second game being 3 Tidehunter with 4 Mirana! |    On this week's Teach Me Thursday Bee and Ursi are doing their absolute darndest to discuss the video game Dota Two, but might die in the process. Topics include: New Valve conduct patch, Smurf Ethics 101, Kunkka mid, Legion Commander, Pick vs. Counterpick, Smoking when you're in solo queue, Drum, Valve communication improvement (?), and plenty, plenty more!      \xa0      \xa0    | On this week's Theorycraft Tuesday Proud and Ursi are revealing themselves as Lycan Aghs Appreciators(tm) and also discussing many other, but ultimately less significant, things. Some topics include: Nightstalker, Keeper of the Light, Ignuus Fatuus combos, Legion Commander, Witch Doctor lanes, resetting waves at-will, Enchantress 3 team comps, more developed analysis/theorizing around Freight Train Dota, Tusk, Drow, and plenty more! |       On this week's Theorycraft episode Proud and Ursi get deep in the weeds of the seemingly-small-but-actually-huge 7.22G and how it's going to change the overall game as well as their personal picks!

In the first half, we talk through a whole heap of new film trailers we\'ve been watching recently, cover Apex Legends\' new map (and all it\'s lovely colours, for some reason), and play another lovely game of Mr. Lister\'s Quiz Shootout. But the second half is deeper, darker, spoilier. We\'ve just seen Joker, and Joe, Cardy and Matt convened to talk it through\xa0in it\'s entirety. Listen at your own risk. And remember, if you want to get in touch with the podcast, please do: ign_ukfeedback@ign.com. | Cardy, Dale, and Matt sit down at the UK Podcast table this week to discuss a plethora of delights, starting with the exploits of Mr. Joaquin Phoenix in this year\'s other other big comic book movie, Joker. Matt and Cardy have also been to see Rian Johnson\'s latest, Knives Out, and discuss why it\'s a great pallet cleanser following The Last Jedi. There\'s also some quickfire takes on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\'s beta, The Last of Us Part 2, Borderlands 3, Sayonara Wild Heats, and the beautiful chaos that is Untitled Goose Game.\xa0 | Cardy & Joe have both been reviewing games this week so gather round the podcast table for layers of critical thought. Link\'s Awakening has been remade for the Switch so Joe tells you why that\'s a banger and Cardy has done FIFA again so explains what\'s up with the footballs this year.\xa0Borderlands 3 also gets its fair share of debate time. Meanwhile, Dale is convinced that new Netflix show "The I-Land" has ripped him off and is out to prove it. Joe\'s got a list-based quiz for the Endless Search as well as plenty of time for your feedback. | Tokyo Game Show is happening right now, bringing big revelations about some of Japan\'s biggest games. So you know what that means: long chats about what the hell is going on in Death Stranding. Joe, Cardy and Matt discuss Kojima\'s latest revelations, and it looks like we finally know what you do in the game. There\'s more than Thermos babies to discuss, though. We\'ve been playing a duo of delights in Gears 5 and Catherine: Full Body, plus the slightly less delightful Daemon X Machina. And in film chat, we discuss Brad Pitt\'s journey to the far side of the galaxy in the serene and existential Ad Astra. And, as ever, there\'s another thrilling edition of The Endless Search. | Matt has seen IT Chapter Two and not only does tell us his feelings, but he also shares his interview he did with the film\'s director,\xa0Andy Muschietti. But that\'s not the only scaries we have this week. In what feels like an early halloween, we have three spooky games to bang on about. Dale has played Blair Witch and has a lot of thoughts about the game and the history of the series. Jesse talks about finishing Man of Medan three times and Dale has also tried out the latest PS4 FMV game, Erica. We also have a detour chat about the Star Wars prequels. And of course, there\'s this week edition of The Endless Search. | If you aren\'t from the UK, you might not be aware that we aren\'t getting Disney+ along with the rest of the world. We have some stuff to say about that.\xa0 Once we\'ve gone through the stages of grief, we have time to talk about The Mandalorian, new Disney and Star Wars series, and Control. We even squeezed in a chat with Brian Froud, the genius behind the many, many designs of creatures in The Dark Crystal, and its new Netflix Prequel, Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. Thanks Brian! And remember, if you want to get in touch with the podcast, please do: ign_ukfeedback@ign.com | Look, Gamescom was very busy, so we recorded the special when we got back. Inauthentic? Yes. Tired? Also yes. But we are at least comprehensive. That\'s why you get big hunky chunks of Death Stranding, Disintegration, Marvel\'s Avengers, The Endless Cylinder and more. Also, Joe turned Farming Simulator into an actual game! (Sorry, Germany). And remember, if you want to get in touch with the podcast, please do: ign_ukfeedback@ign.com | 16 Podcasters, 300 audience members, 1 live band and 500 episodes.\xa0This is the IGN UK Podcast\'s 500th episode live spectacular!\xa0 We roped in a whole host of voices from past and present to join us live at London\'s famous 100 Club. With four panels of four, we talked about our favourite memories from the last ten years of podcasts. We also had not one, but three of our favourite Endless Search games with the amazing Code:Marla doing a live performance of jingle (yes, they did it 3 times!). A great time was had by all, but mostly by us! Thank you so much to all the amazing people who traveled so far and helped make this event so special. Here\'s to another 500 episodes! | We really tried not to talk about crisps this week. I mean, obviously we did, but we talked about milk production too! Oh also there was chat about No Man\'s Sky, FIFA 20, Half Dead 2 and The Club, played a tweaked game of PG Tips, and we revealed a tiny little bit more about Podcast 500. Remember, it\'s on\xa0Friday 16th August, and you can get your ticket\xa0here! And remember, if you want to get in touch with the podcast, please do: ign_ukfeedback@ign.com | Cardy and Matt have been lucky enough to see Quentin Tarantino\'s 9th/10th (depending on who you ask) film, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. They possess different views on the film, sparking MUCH chat. Joe\'s been spending more time playing hard Japanese games so here is to tell us all about Fire Emblem: Three Houses and the upcoming Monster Hunter: World expansion, Iceborne. We also break down Amazon\'s The Boys and pay a brief visit to Fast and Furious spin-off, Hobbs and Shaw. Joe has a new Endless Search offering this week and crisp conversation also takes place, but we\'re opening up the tuck shop this week...', 'chan_desc': "Hear the magic that happens when all members of the IGN UK team run head first at each other to chat about video games, movies, TV shows and weird things they've put in their mouths.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/e7/15/f2/e715f212-7d1a-c414-2d02-715a85aefb83/mza_7722546745827796785.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2014-08-22'}}

Enjoy! | Development: Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light, known as Final Fantasy Gaiden in Japan, is a Role Playing Game developed by Matrix Software and published by Square Enix on October 29, 2009 in Japan, and October 5th, 2010 in the States. You may remember Matrix Software from their IOS ports of Final Fantasy II, IV, V, VI,\xa0 After Years, and even Dragon Quest V. This is the second Final Fantasy game to wield the Gaiden, or spinoff title, in Japan; The other being the aforereviewed Final Fantasy Adventure. The game’s directors were Takashi Tokita and Hiroaki Yabuta. Tokita you may remember as the director of Chrono Trigger and Parasite Eve. He also worked as lead designer for Final Fantasy IV. The game was produced by Tomoya Asano, the lead artist was Akihiko Yoshida; Yoshida worked on background art and main character design for the Ivalice games, where Mizuta worked on FFXI with Uematsu, and that god awful Parasite Eve 2. The development team had begun to consider a sequel to this game, and that’s why we’re going to play Bravely Default; which is what that “sequel” eventually became. The entire game was meant to be a throwback to the original titles in the Final Fantasy series, and you can definitely tell. The game featured an interesting storybook style art design, similar to Chocobo’s Tales, and also features a pretty bitchin version of the job system from FF III and V. The development team looked to DQ games, and other popular NES era RPG’s for inspiration as well as previous FF titles. \xa0 Plot: The game starts out in the city of Horne with our main hero Brandt. Brandt is presenting himself to the king to enter manhood, and discovers that the Princess, Aire, has been taken by the Witch of the North, named Louhi. Along the way, Brandt meets up with his moody friend Jusqua and the princess’ personal bodyguard, and savior of us all, Yunita. Together they journey to the witche’s house, and eventually slay Louhi. When we trudge back to Horne, we find that the entire town has been turned to stone by some curse, and the king is missing. This is when our little fellowshiop breaks for the time being. Brandt and Yunita try to restore Horne’s villagers, while Jusqua and Aire flee to Liberte, a seafaring town. Brandt and Yunita meet a fellow named Krinjh in a nearby desert, who leads them to the magic kingdom of Guera. The King of Guera asks them to deal with the fucking Sandman, since Spiderman is busy, and you agree. But of course, he annihalates you, because you need water spells and the LEADER ORDERS A FUCKING FREEZE ON WATER SPELL SALES! Anyway, you win the fight, but the sand creature is revealed to be Araidne, who Krinjh runs away with. Aire meets up with a fairy named Lilibelle, and gets turned into a cat. Aire leaves Jusqua’s grumpy ass behind, and finds Brandt, who also left Yunita behind for some reason… Anyway, they head to Arbor forest, where the Queen of the forest turns Brandt into a plant, because she doesn’t trust humans after the events of Ferngully 1, and dare I say 2. Aire then teams up with a mouse named Tortehhhh to find an Animal Staff in order to turn Brandt into a dog, thus making him more trustworthy. But before we get this taken care of, we must defeat Arbaroc; the guardian of Arbor. We knock him out, and the Queen of Arbor turns the Animal Staff into the Transformation Staff, which allows us to go transspecial with a mere three menu clicks. We then first learn of Rolan, who searches for the Dark Towe…. Wait, no. He’s just a dude from Spelvia who may know how to help Horne. The two animals Aire and Brandt climb the great tree of the arbor and leap to the super FF-esque floating island of Spelvia, but Aire is the only one who makes it across. Jusqua finds a regular cat, who he mistakes for Aire somehow, and travels to Urbeth; finding Yunita and a sorcerer who claims to be able to lift the curse from “Aire”. We earn some dough by completing some quests for the locals, and then we find out that the dirty sorcerer was nothing more than a con artist, who promptly escapes to the six teraflop city of Invidia. Jusqua leaves warrior princess Yunita behind and pursues the sorcerer on a boat. He’s soon reunited with Brandt, and learns that Aire was with him the whole time. When our two heroes arrive in Invidia, they meet up with a girl named Rekoteh who helps them get the dragon harp, which allows the party to summon a dragon to fly to Spelvia. Yunita has climbed the tower to the Sky to reach the town, and meets up with Aire as they arrive. We then visit Rolan, who also dislikes humans, and has locked himself away in solitude. Then we get a sweet sequence where Yunita and Aire travel into Rolan’s unconcious mind with the help of the Witch of the Sky to destroy the monsters controlling him. This, however, causes Rolan to ulneash the darkness that was locked away inside him, and warp the very fabric of reality. Ardyn, anyone?? At this point, the heroes search for the Weapons of Light to save the world from the Dark Lord that the ancient hero Rolan defeated and sealed away. In the kingdom of Guera’s past, Krinj is a servant of their past king, who turns out to be Asmodeus, or as Joe and I call him, Assdemon, the demon of lust; and he lusts after your juicy asscheeks, to be sure. Yunita prevents his evil plans from being completed by using the Merkmal, or Merkin, to reveal his true identity, and then the group fights him, gets fucking wrecked, and darkness wins the day. 40 times. Until eventually he doesn’t fuck you over instantly, and you defeat him. Krinjh then rewards you with the Shield of Light, which I actually didn’t take at first, which led me to be lost for about three hours last night. Krinjh eventually becomes king, and makes peace with the nearby nations. In Liberte’s past, and artist is looking to create the most beautiful piece of art ever, and wants to incorporate Lillibelle into it. A bunch of pirates steal the work, and we find out they were being possessed. ONce we free them, we awaken Cetus, an ancient whale, and use him to defeat Leviathan, the demon of envy. Urubeth was once a city of faith, but a recent plague turned it into a commerce town. Thazund, one of the high merchants of the town, has a daughter who has fallen ill to the plague. Jusqua is determined to prevent this, and finds a cure, but we also find out that the town apothecary is causing the plague, and selling the medicine at an absurdly high markup. We reveal him to be Beelzebub, the demon of Gluttony, and rip him apart. For our good deeds, Thauzand gives us the Cape of Light, and Urbeth becomes balanced between commerce, and faith. We then move to Arbor. Torte, once a human rather than the rat we know him as, releases Belphegor, the demon of sloth, or ass to ass, in order to obtain the super OP spell Lux. His punishment is being turned into a mouse, and he is the catalyst for the Arbor Queen’s distaste towards humans. Belphagor attempts to posses Aebaroc to destroy Arbor. Originally, Belphagor wins, but our time warp intervention prevents it. But not before he fucks you over, and over, and over, and over again. With Belfaggot dead, we receive the spell Lux; and my god is it useful. Now we turn to Invidia, home of the Ruskies. We help the daughter of Rekoteh, and journey to the Sun Temple to defeat Mammon, the demon of greed. Once we return to the village, spring finally arrives, and we are awarded with the Armor of Light. We also visit Spelvia in the past, and save Rolan from the darkness. We dive into his soul, and defeat Lucifer himfuckingself, the demon of pride, and free Rolan’s soul. He awards us with the Sword of Light. We finally make it back to Horne, who is suffering a drought. This extreme situation called for extreme measures, and the town voted to ask the witch Louhi for help. This is also, oddly, the day of Aire’s birth. Her father agrees to give her away to break the seal on the legendary black magic. Our defiance of the deal by saving Aire, and killing Louhi, caused the curse in the first place.We eventually use the lamp of truth to question the shitlord king of this place, and find out that he’s Satan, demon of wrath. Brandt’s parrot shows up, and reveals himself as the actual mayor. This is when we find out that we were played in the beginning, and serving evil. The king thanks us, and gives us the overpowered black magic Desolator. Once our for heroe’s have the weapons of light, they use Cletus to enter the Dark World, and not the one from that crap Thor movie, either. We, of fucking course, lose all of our jobs, and have to earn them back by defeating all the douche bosses that the game offered; first and foremost are Assdemon and Belfaggot. This is a very similar idea to FFVIII’s final dungeon, tbh. We then face off against Chaos, who shatters our job creating crystal, and still loses to us. But again, not after making me spend hour after hour journeying to fight him again and again. We then embark on our world tour, returning the sacred weapons. Everything is good to go, and we finally return home.   | This week, Schweiss and Joe keep their longtime supporter Susanne up way past her bedtime to record an episode.

We\'ll be back with a regular episode of Idle Thumbs next week!Discussed: Making a comfortable office, borrowing animal features and giving them to robots, podcasting remotely, web-based applets, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Marvel Heroes, working on licensed games, intellectual properties, the books of David Mitchell, books we like, applying the rules of basic arithmetic to the Twelve Days of Christmas, international cuisine, lab-grown food, the future of food preparation, The Nutcracker, gift giving, learning a new skill, getting distracted and not learning anything, wanting to get into something that seems cool but being unable to', 'chan_desc': "Idle Thumbs is a video game podcast full of in-depth discussion and absurdity. Between overly-enthusiastic dissections of their latest media experiences and baffling phonological explorations of Jeff Goldblum's name, the cast has managed to find a regular audience of dedicated readers.

We’ll be back. Probably. Somebody\'s gotta rewatch all of Neon Genesis Evangelion, right? But even if this is our final episode, we’re going out with a banger. Cado, Austin, Natalie, Rob, and Patrick recently spent time in a theater with the latest horror film from writer/director Jordan Peele, Us, a movie that’s impossible to watch without having a strong reaction; it’s a movie that will not be ignored.

But many different letters were laid to our charge over the course of this re-watch, and now honor demands that Austin, Natalie, and Rob be allowed to respond. We have a very serious conversation about Lydia\'s storyline and the challenges it poses in any adaptation or in any attempt to modernize it. We also also get some excellent food for thought about neurodivergent characters in Austen\'s work and in this particular adaptation of \u200bPride and Prejudice. \u200bSpeaking of food, we finally learn what that "sausage pastry" was from the first episode. Thanks once again for listening to this absurdly detailed, loving, and ridiculous return to a landmark TV series.

The last episode of the 1995 BBC \u200bPride and Prejudice\u200b\u200b, and therefore the very last episode of our Be Good and Rewatch It series, which of course will conclude next week because we ran long and broke the letters section out into its own podcast! God and Waypoint aren\'t done with you yet, Mr. Darcy and Lizzie Bennett! First, however, we have to get these two problematic faves into a marriage knot... and see Lizzie finally square-up with Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who has condescended to get her ass kicked. We also delve into the mystery of who tipped Lady Catherine about Darcy\'s attachment to Elizabeth, and consider our final verdicts on Mr. Bennett. We also talk about the more realistic, restrained portrayals of the BBC adaptation with the more tempestuous approach taken by the 2005 film, which tries to render the interior monologues of the novel into action on film.  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | With their co-hosts out of action this week, Rob and Austin take a break from the team\'s ongoing deep dive\u200b into the BBC\'s 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen\'s Pride and Prejudice \u200bin favor of something altogether different... a deep dive into the BBC\'s 2009 adaptation of Jane Austen\'s \u200bEmma\u200b. They dig into the story\'s class satire, the startling chemistry between leads Romola Garai\u200b and Jonny Lee Miller, and their own romantic missteps. And they do all that in just \u200bone\u200b recording, making this a true Waypoint achievement.  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Things are going well, a little too well, for Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. Which means it\'s time for Lydia Bennett to stop being a supporting player in this comedy and become a star in her own romantic drama. Today on the first part of our\xa0Pride and Prejudice\xa0rewatch finale, we discuss the fatalist snark of Caroline Bingley, Lizzie\'s growing maturity and awareness, and what Georgiana Darcy reveals about this story. But the biggest topic of discussion is Lydia\'s disastrous elopement with Mr. Wickham. How do we approach a story that treats as a scandal the sexual agency of a teenage girl, and underplays the predatory aspect of Wickham\'s conduct? If the entire subplot is built on an outdated, misogynist foundation, is it still fair to find Lydia to be a loathsome heel by the end of it?  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | For BGRW We might as well face this head-on. There\'s no hiding from it. We spend an hour of this podcast discussing, in detail, our discomfort and ambivalence about the way our heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, begins to turn all the way around on Fitzwilliam Darcy when she sees his mansion. Is she being influenced by crass material considerations? What do we make of this weird, almost mythologized connection between Darcy and his estate at Pemberley? We discuss Romanticism, Transcendentalism, and Austin\'s slashfic about Peter Parker and Darcy. We also dig into both the creepiness of Wickham, and the ways he is still misjudged and his dangerousness under-rated even after his character has been revealed, plus Mr. Bennett\'s maddening complacency. We learn Natalie has trouble with imagery and metaphor, Rob is a bootlicking landlord apologist, and Austin has a worrying thing about wolves.

Once again we got in too deep, so our second episode of the BBC \u200bPride and Prejudice \u200bonly covers the third episode of the miniseries. But who can blame us! As connoisseurs of human folly, we are eager to savor such delights as these: Charlotte Lucas\'s marriage to Mr. Collins and what it is meant to say in the original novel, versus Lucy Scott\'s decides to portray in her reading of the character. Mr. Wickham\'s increasingly oily charm and aggressive self-pity. Lady Catherine, in which we get a taste of what happens if you took Lizzie\'s and Mrs. Bennett\'s worst possible traits and poured money over them. Col. Fitzwilliam\'s catastrophic assistance to Darcy. And finally, Darcy\'s own attempts at balancing romance with radical honesty.Clips: Darcy\'s Confession, Rest in Fucking Pieces Mr Darcy, 2005 Darcy Confession  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | In what was supposed to be an episode covering the first half of the six-part series, Rob, Natalie, and Danielle spend two hours breaking down the first three-quarters of the first episode. Then Rob and Natalie reconvene to discuss the second episode. The third episode, our original stopping point, is completely forgotten! It will have to wait for next week. But don\'t get discouraged, there\'s a lot to dig into here. Who do we find ourselves strangely sympathetic to in this telling of Jane Austen\'s masterpiece? Mr. Bennett: avuncular dad or secret villain of the entire story? Is Lizzie actually that good a sister? How did we miss the red flags with Wickham? Is Matthew Macfadyen\'s awkward and conflicted Darcy in the 2005 film a more convincing portrayal than the intensely magnetic Darcy portrayed by Colin Firth? And finally, what are you supposed to do with Mr. Collins?

A modern adaptation of Jane Austen\'s \u200bEmma\u200b, \u200bClueless \u200bwas a comedy of manners for children of the 1990s... or at least those who dreamed of what life might be like if you were that young, that rich, and that insulated from consequences. But does its tongue-in-cheek portrayal of young women and their social lives hold up today? Did the media that came after \u200bClueless \u200band often imitated it, like \u200bCruel Intentions \u200band later \u200bGossip Girl\u200b, break from the film\'s philosophy or merely unearth a darkness that was already there? So is Paul Rudd like her step-brother, and isn\'t that kind of weird? Danielle, Natalie, and Rob dig into all of it on this episode of \u200bBe Good and Rewatch It\u200b.
